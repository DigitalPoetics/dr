There\u2019s no other world. He needs\na world he can fight or else he\u2019ll be back in uneasiness.\n\n     One has to exist in pain.\n\n     Because Baudelaire kept running from pain, he had no friends and\nfew intimates among derelicts.\n\n     The difference between a writer and its world gives the reason for\nwriting. All mental existence is an expression, a measure of distance.\n\n\n     There\u2019s another way of saying this. Consciousness just exists: no\nreason: it is useless. There is no meaning in the world. Consciousness\ncreates meaning.\n\n     Let\u2019s start again. A human being\u2019s life starts when two humans\ncalled parents for no reason in the world stick that kid into the world.\nThen the parents turn against the kid and tell the kid it has to do\nsuch-and-such and become SOMEBODY or else they\u2019ll kick it out or else\nthe parents just turn against the kid and say YOU STINK. The kid\nrealizes it was once part of a warm perfect hole whole not apart and\nnou) it has an existence: It is separate. It is itself. It has no\nmeaning. The great cry is against no meaning cause that\u2019s scary and\nboring and painful.\n\n     The kid can\u2019t go back. Rather than remaining in pain, the kid says\nI\u2019m not nothing pain, because I am separate. Fuck you. My separate-\nness is fuck you is total hatred is and will always be against you\nagainst everything that exists. I am a natural rebel.\n\n     The poet knows how ridiculous any action is cause it\u2019s actually\nnothing, so he makes sure his poetry and everything else he does is as\nstupid as possible.\n\n     About method of writing: There\u2019s no such thing as real action.\nWhat we mean by action is creation. Because there\u2019s no meaning.\nCreation is pure freedom: before it there\u2019s nothing; it begins by\ncreating its own principles. First and foremost it invents its own\ngoal and in that way it partakes of the gratuitousness of consciousness.\nThis explains camp.\n\n     I don\u2019t want any ethic. I don\u2019t want to say anything is right.\nI have no desire to tell anyone what to do and I just take teaching\ngigs for the money. I don\u2019t say this is how you write. I keep saying\nI don\u2019t know anyway of writing. I WANT TO SAY NO TO WHAT     IS I WANT TO\n\nGO OVER: I DON\u2019T WANT ANY CONTENT I JUST WANT EXTREMISM.\n\n     Once a human\u2019s grasped this truth: that there\u2019s no other end in\nthis life except the one it\u2019s chosen, it no longer feels any   desire  to\n\nlook for one. But suppose we don\u2019t care what we choose?\n\n     What I feel is lousy, immense discouragement, a heaviness of\nunbearable isolation...absence of desires, impossibility of finding any\nsort of amusement. I call this my laziness.\n\n     So I do things suddenly, when I don\u2019t think! anything! I seem to\nother people active, impulsive, destructive, a person who acts and\ndoesn\u2019t care VIOLENT. This is the only way I can act. This is the\nonly way I can write. Bad. Obviously I don\u2019t believe in anything I\u2019m\ndoing the minute I\u2019m doing long enough for self-consciousness to arise\nI stop \\ hat I\u2019m doing.\n\n     A poet a person has no morality.\n\n     I need your boringness your self-righteousness your hatred of me\nmy paranoia just cause of who I am this loneliness solitude pain inside\n\n\nmy head everything coming from the poverty I choose to keep flagellating\nmyself to go over.\n\n     One needs laws, the laws of writing, so one can hate them.\n"},{"uid":"KathyAcker_TheInvisibleUniverse_1982","author":"Kathy Acker","shortTitle":"The Invisible Universe","title":"Kathy Acker | The Invisible Universe | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1982","date":1982,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":4.0,"database":null,"url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEvol4\/pictures\/043.html","text":"\n                The Invisible Universe\n\n\n\n\n            Kathy Acker\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t at all work to say that you fantasize \u2014 that would be taking the fantasy for a representation\nof scenes. Rather, I believe, your use of fantasy enables you to render intricate, organicize the text.\nFreud explains that, for an individual, fantasy admits all the combinations. Example: I hit you; I am\nyou hit; ... The verb here doesn't change. Likewise, in your fantastic texts, the verb (the action) is also\nthe main actor and the represented. Fantasy, then, is a structural combination. It is: all possible\nactions, or the illusion of monotony. Variations and mutations repeat the same verbal structure. Do\nyou agree?\n\n        Yes. The organic process I use immediately proposes, then divides the text. Not what is\nsupposedly represented, but the text. When I am writing, the text-body is my body so there's no\nproblem of inadequate fantasy (fantasy versus reality). The movement is strictly economic. There's no\neroticism, for eroticism is simply a deviation of the sexual act. Desire creates hierarchies and\n'unnatural' has no meaning. All acts are part of the sexual movement as all sexual movements are\nparts of all other acts. The text is material.\n\n        In fact, the text is never sexual. It is only material, nothing else. What destroys idealism\ndeepens the materialism of the text. Then the sexual act disappears, or is lacking, under the mass of\nprocesses.\n\n        How does writing destroy?\n\n        By breaking down idealisms. I bring everything to the material level. Active Verbs; present\nparticiples and the past perfects of these active verbs; these kinds of adjectives or the redoubled\nprefixes of verbs rather than adverbs; commas and dashes instead of full stops. The abolition of all\npsychological, humanistic, and metaphysical terms. Complete attention to the phonetic material\nlevel.\n\n        The text sits on an incessant double working: the webbing of a word's reference and a word's\nSound. This and only this is the text. There is no idealist proposal.\n\n        The text is a motor: Everything in it is for a purpose: Words are written to be eaten; words\nlead, treaties, up to their exhaustion.\n\n        The text has roots simultaneously in the body which acts and the body that writes. I use\nthree levels of writing. At first, a savage text that I wrote when I was fourteen. For me the sexual\ndesire has always been bound to this savage desire to write. I write as I masturbate. On the other\nhand, there's a text of notes, a huge mass of notes, the learned text. Just as my day begins around\n9:00 Am and ends at 2:00 AM (from 9:00 AM to i:00 PM and from 10:00 PM to 2:00 AM), so one\n\n\ntext is inserted into this time circle in a regular manner and then another. I don't write; I type. I\nmechanically insert one text into another text. Mechanically meaning musically. While I was writing\nEDEN, EDEN, EDEN (Gallimard), I was listening to Japanese, African, Arab, South American jazz,\nthe whole mass of Italian madrigals, Monteverdi. I calculated the timbre, the volume. Each text-\nsound immediately modulates every other text-sound. The wind immediately modulates each organic\nnoise. All relation-textures are always inextricable.\n\n[EDITORS 'NOTE: Above based on interviews with Pierre Guyotat in literature L'Interdite (Gallimard, 1974).]\n\n                                               \u2022\n\nReporting is a means to an end. In reporting, the reporter uses language to describe an incident\nwhich is outside the language being used. Literature, on the other hand, is not a means to an end.\nTherefore: when meaning is destroyed, literature emerges.\n\nWhen, teaching English to Tournon students, I lost my belief in God, I began to believe in literature.\nThe commitment to act for the Western world is what religious practice\/ philosophy is for the\nEastern.\n\nSince words not ideas or meanings make up literature, the actual words the 'purest' (i.e. stripped as\nfar as possible of references) relations between words, for that's what words are, are literature's\nground. The values of truth or falsehood, or fiction and documentation, refer to referentiality.\n\nThe crux here, and if it is lost literature disappears, is that words are referential.\n\nAny genre of writing \u2014 political analysis, romantic novels, mathematical proofs, Ronald Reagan's\nvomittings \u2014 as soon as its meaning is destroyed becomes literature. The hotter the writing, the\ngreater the tension between the meaning(s) and the ongoing destruction, the more literary the work.\n\nFor those to whom reality is unbearable .\n\nIf literature concerns itself with truth values only insofar as it concerns itself with referentiality, what\nis reality for a writer? If the reality is the words themselves, words are existences whose values depend\non differences. Words are precise measurings of specificities. Money as it occurs in our society is the\nopposite of such occurrences. Since money now defines the greatest proportion of human relations,\nvaluable or specific human relations aren't occurring. For instance, on Christmas Day an American\npilot can, by machine, write MERRY CHRISTMAS on a bomb and send it down to Vietnam only\n\n\nbecause he, I presume it's a he, doesn't know reality or value. The American school system bases its\neducational practices on the definition of knowledge as the remembering of information. But knowing\n(reality) is knowing values.\n\nWhy do we want to destroy?\n\nBecause a value is specific and absolute unto itself. No person knows by reducing events in time to\nmeanings. For instance, a newspaper reporter uses the meanings his words refer to to suggest certain\nmodels or control his readers. Truth is a contrivance resting on opinion which is always taught.\n\n         The shit is a poet. She's a poet because she tells everyone to go to hell. That's the only\ndefinition of a poet there is. She the shit poet has lots and lots of money. Not LOTS of money, but\nshe is an upperclass bourgeois ensconced in wealth, which means she doesn't know she's as starving as\nthe American misery-stricken bums she's as poor as them she will find this out when during even the\nslightest Depression, and in the future the American economy has to undergo BIG DEPRESSIONS\nINFLATIONARY RECESSIONS, the least miserly landlord is going to take back his house which\nshe's been paying a huge mortgage on fifty years now while her taxes will rise. Dear Bourgeoisie, your\nbourgeois money isn't real money. Someone's been fooling you. So this shit poet has childhood\nmaterial crap and a mommy and daddy who love her. Mommy doesn't teach her she's a cunt, but\ninstead feeds her TV and talks to her just like the TV mothers think their TV daughters are their best\nfriends. Daddy doesn't rape her. This is the happy family. What is a happy marriage? Does a cock\nknow how to go into a cunt anymore?\n\n         Daddy dies because he buries his head in shit just like an ostrich which is very stupid of him.\nNo one now knows what he was thinking about. Two years before he died he blew eight hundred\nthou and then he stole his mommy\u2019s diamond rings, but he wasn't a drag queen so he couldn't have\nblown the money on men. The next year mommy married a tight-ass Colonel because she had a hot\ncunt. Mothers have no right to be women and women have no right to have cunts they should be\ndevoted to their children. Because they don\u2019t cut out their livers and feed them braised in marsala to\ntheir children their children want to kill them this is the start of the Spanish revolution.\n\n         How does a great writer come into being? Hatred antipathy to human fear of everything\nselfishness inability to communicate deformed physical attributes chronic illnesses moods like\ndemons in particular: epileptic escapism, thundering na\u00efve desires? The first step in the stage is to\nfuck every streetwalker especially the eight-dollar-a-throw ones. Simultaneously feel mad incurable\nwants for sex (symbols) you can\u2019t have. (The beginning of symbolism.) Put yourself in a position\nwhere you HAVE to escape while a sex disease is rendering you helpless.\n\n         This is the time to escape. (Paradise. The New World. Longings for purity. Love.).....\n\n\n         That human life is but a first installment of the serial soul and that one's individual secret is\nnot lost in the process of earthly dissolution becomes something more than an optimistic conjecture,\nand even more than a matter of religious faith, when we remember that only commonsense rules out\nimmortality. A creative writer can't help feeling that in her rejecting the world of the matter-of-fact,\nin her taking sides with the irrational the illogical the inexplicable and the fundamentally everything,\nthe word is the relationship of repression, she is performing something similar in a rudimentary way\nto what under the cloudy skies of gray Venus.\n\n         For Owl, wise though He was in many ways, able to read and write and spell his own name\nWOL, yet somehow went to pieces over delicate words like MEASLES and BUTTERED TOAST.\n\n         'Owl, I require an answer! It's Bear speaking!'\n\n         But the circularity of the signification of any particular signifier itself caught in the\ncircularity of the signification of language itself so that issuing a reward is sneezing and there are no\ntissues around because there weren't any sneezes so Owl goes on and on, using longer and longer\nwords, until at last he comes back to where he started but nobody can remember where that is.\n\n         He didn't really know what Owl was talking about.\n\n         'Didn't you see the words?' said Owl, a little surprised. 'Come and look at them now.' So\nthey went outside. And Pooh looked at the words and he looked at the bell-rope, and the more he\nlooked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he had seen something like it, somewhere else,\nsometime before.\n\n         Pooh nodded.\n\n         'It reminds me of something,' he said.\n\n         Our last night... Up until three in the morning... Dawn cocks crow, my two candles are lit. I\nam sweating, my eyes are burning. I have early morning chills. How many nights behind me! In four\nhours, I leave Cairo. Farewell, Egypt!\n\n         Tyltyl has no sooner turned the diamond than a sudden and wonderful change comes over\neverything. The old Fairy alters then and there into a princess of marvellous beauty; the flints of\nwhich the slum-building's walls are built light up, turn blue as sapphires, become transparent and\nshine and spin like the most precious of stones. The junk furniture takes life becomes resplendent;\nthe deal table assumes as grave and noble an air as a marble table; the clock face winks its eye and\nsmiles genially, while the door which contains the pendulum opens and releases the hours, which,\nholding one another by the hand and laughing merrily, begin to dance to delicious music.\n\n\n"},{"uid":"BruceAndrews_Articles_1978","author":"Bruce Andrews","shortTitle":"Articles","title":"Bruce Andrews | Articles | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn3\/pictures\/012.html","text":"\n\n\n        ARTICLES\n\nBoundaries overlap, dissolve \u2014 in writing, as well as in discussions of\nwriting.

The subject loses authority, dis-\nappears, is unmade into a network of relationships, stretching\nindefinitely. Subject is deconstructed, lost, \u2019\u2019diminishing like a\nfigurine at the far end of the literary stage\u201d; deconstituted as\nwriting ranges over the surface. A floating or cutting across replaces\nthe barriers of nomenclature and identification. Normalization gives\nway to signi fiance, an eroticism, a multi-dimensional tissue or weave\nof signs by which any apparent subject is produced. Writing, as\ninfinite association, explodes the definitions, endistances origins\n(or Origin), rejects closure, exempts meaning. The vise of the signi-\nfied is unhinged; simplistic notions of truth are relativized.\n\n    Subject becomes simply \"the instance writing,\" is hollowed out by\nthe operation of the linguistic system. System, here, is an empty\nprocess that some self always seeks to stuff & upholster. In one\ndiscipline after another, we have this recognition of the importance\nof system or code (rather than the romantic primacy of the individual\nor the self-sufficient particular). This may be the watershed of the\nlast few decades. The motifs are system\/ code \/ frame \/ structure\/\nconstraint\/ rules: \"language being system\" & \"the system as culture\",\n\"It is language which speaks, not the author.\"\n\n    Where code pertains \u2014 meaning as use \u2014 rules are dominant.

The older\nliterature of the signified finds itself constantly tempted into com-\nmodification. The signifier, on the other hand, marks the Text. Its\nself-demonstration is a performative, a speech act whose content is\ndepleted by its own utterance and activity; it \"artfully does nothing\nbut turn itself inside out, like a glove\"; a perpetual signifer^\nmodelled on a permanent revolution. Flustering the image, acknowledg-\ning the materiality of language, not letting the subject idealize or\nmystify the whole process. \"Did he wish to express himself, he ought\n\n\nat least to know that the inner \u2019thing\u2019 he thinks to \u2019translate\u2019 is\nitself only a ready-formed dictionary, its words only explainable\nthrough other words, and so on indefinitely.\u201d\n\n    Yet, beyond code: Language is disseminated through the text,\nthat \u2019\u2019methodological field,\u201d climaxing in play, not anchored by but in\nfact shattering the demands of our seemingly-liberating-but-actually-\nrepressive genres of expression.

Distinguishable,\neven deviant writing, rather than something malleable or blind or\nsomething that could be processed or theatricalized (like the self?).\nBeyond the anchoring of pointing, vertical depth, is a horizontal\nrichness that cannot be diffracted or identified with. Ambiguity is\nceaselessly produced and not swallowed up. An excess, a supplement.\nHere writing can innovate, as scandal, not destroying code but playing\noff it, deferring, showing the limits. In these cases, writing is\nclearly produced by the central activity of reading, capturing both\nthe code-like aspects (with the investment of value) but also the\nyearning singularity of the phonemes bursting off page, tape, or lips.\nReading becomes the first production, rather than consumption \u2014 not\na relay of an author\u2019s vain transcriptions of a representational\ncontent. Reading operates the text, is a rewriting, a new inscription.\nThe text erases \u2019\u2019the distance between writing and reading, in no way\nby intensifying the projection of the reader into the work ^hypnosis\nof the reader by illusions of transparency^ but by joining them\u201d in\na single practice.\n\n    Discourse as tyranny, as The Law, The Letter: all instrumentalisms:\ndisorient them.

Offer a historicism, where words are\nevitable, arbitary, not determined: a relative autonomy for language.\nA code is required; the whole is digital, not an illusory analogue,\nnor identity, equality, interchangeability. Texts (tests) like these\nwill do the denaturalizing*, they problematicize reality. Naturally\nlanguage is unmotivated. See it this way.

Prose\nmeans world \u2014 i.e., established world, suffocation.\n\n\n        If language is placed in a dependent relationship, then the nature of communication is\naffected. What is communicated? \u2014 something preconstituted, prepackaged, as if already\nunderstood, laid out for consumption by the neutral tables of clarity. The external world is given a\nsecure identity that precedes this mediation. I think it needs reporting . So communication\nmight not involve active signifying. That work is subordinated, transitive.

LANGUAGE AS A SYSTEM & A STRUCTURALIST ANTI-SYSTEM POETICS\n\n\nWords \/ were \/ what \/ were \/ whole \/ what \/ wasted \/ words \/ want \/ waiting \/ Whose . More than a\nprop . the words fit awkwardly into the context .\n\n         This paradigm of language as a medium of representation, or pointing, is open to challenge.\nMost notably, a structuralist view of language can challenge it, setting out a number of assertions in\nboldface that need to be assimilated. Do filter something words before filtering mean? Language\nceases to accept its subordinate role in a program of writing taken is representation, invisible ink.\nUnnaming . The medium is no longer a stand-in for 'the world' but the mechanism by which we\nthought the world was being represented. and the containers always the containers . ocular proof\nabandon . Not language as a neutral collection of discrete (and discreet) pointers, each with its\nown relationship to some 'pointee'. Copies a copy .\n\n          Instead: language as a relatively autonomous system.\n\n\n          Look at language . If language as medium forms this system, then the intrinsic or\ndistinguishing features of writing as an art form derive from the structure of the sign. an abstract\nvolition \/ now call \u2018semiotic\u2019. sign emphasis begins .

The sign is a binary promise and forms a system that allows\nfor signification by setting up its own grid of distinctions.

The intervening system is made up of a pattern of signifieds \u2014\nconcepts, occurrences in the mind \u2014 to which the material signifiers of language are connected.\nPraxis splinting as not \/ thus get their necks broken . Signs are held at a distance from the referents.\nMediation.\n\n\n         acknowledges the vacuum . Words all oomph . In this view, individual signifiers have\nno natural relationship to individual signifieds or mental imagery, and certainly not to individual\nreferents. paren not colon\n\n         compel sign univocal paren .            a passing forth as out of antiqued rhetoric . The\nmatter of words does not dissolve into reference; reference is not a solvent, not a solution. A\ngovernability of text which is more autonomous: it is as if there were nothing beyond it, correcting it.\nAll these relationships are conventional, guided by social norms. Arbitrary relationships. The\nindependence of material form is emphasized. The relative autonomy of the signifier in a structuralist\ntheory of language parallels the relative autonomy of the state in a structuralist theory of capitalist\npolitical economy.\n\n         Throttle blank \/ showmanship of , In this medium as language as sign system, signifying\nis an active process. forked tribulation not like roving 'Y is superstructure to base X' . But it occurs\nnegatively. Terms signify by being differentiated from all the other terms in the system, by opposing\nthemselves to other terms in the way of difference that could serve \u2014 complicatedly .\n\n         So, signification is systematic production, a relational system. rules\n\n         (the differential world) ampersand physicality . It is not intrinsic; it is not\nindividualistic, point by point.    only transpose \u2014 intact, loneliness, a hint of positionism \u2014 waits,\n\nspeaks through us, regroup .

The signifieds\nare set loose, or recede even more into the background of the literary or artistic event. Signifiers\nassume greater autonomy. A Jacobinism. If production is what systems do, then subversion is an anti-\nproduction. Capital flight . An opacity, a lack of utility, a spillage, a dissemination, an overt\n\u2018experimentalism\u2019 (to choose an appropriate and negatively charged term).\n\n        \u2018Writing can attack the structure of the sign after declaring that settled system of differences\nto be repressive. But there\u2019s an ironic twist here. The Blob-like social force of interchangeability &\nequivalence (unleashed by the capitalist machine, and so necessary to the commodification of\nlanguage) precedes us: it has actually carried quite far the erosion of the system of differences on\nwhich signification depends. It\u2019s reached the point where a coercive organization of grammar,\nrhetoric, technical format & ideological symbols is normally imposed in everyday life to even get\nthese eroded differences to do their job any more (an assembly line to deliver meanings, of certain\npredetermined kinds). So to call for a heightening of these deterritorializing tendencies may risk a\nmore homogenizing meaninglessness (& one requiring even more coercive props) \u2014 an \u2018easy rider\u2019\non the flood tide of Capital.\u2019\n\n        The problems with such a defiant (an often reflexive) experimentalism are pressing. The\nsocial agenda is still being set elsewhere. These problems suggest the importance of finding a third\nparadigm, a third way of characterizing the medium of language, a third mode of practice \u2014 even if\nonly a few things can be said about it at this point. There is no fully formulated program.\n\nIII. WRITING, MEANING, SOCIETY, VALUE, THE BODY\n\nMeaning what? Is not deductive.

Politics is a ceaseless process of constitution. Not the all-or-nothing eschatology of\nexploitation or its absence. Overt conflict does not make up the entire field. There are constant\ncompromises and acquiescences and almost chemical mixtures and coalitions that lead to different\nforms of hegemony. And hegemony is not ideology, not only a system of thoughts somehow existing\nindependently of their material container. It is more like a policy \u2014 a policy over the body.\nSocialization.

Use of negative sanctions as measure of deficits in legitimacy . So: organize lives in whatever\nways are required for the form of organization to have a felt legitimacy, a lack of coerciveness, the\nability to be justified in some ideal speech or discourse situation. And, obviously, that requires us to\nchallenge present modes and to create new ones. Our relationship to \u2018cultural\u2019 or \u2018community\u2019 codes\nand value is as constitutive as our relationship to the political institutions and apparatus and agency\nof a formal democracy (and look how many people are willing to identify only that with politics).\nBodies Wild objects\n\n        INDEGENIZATION incorrigible at a body dispel pain \/ frame of the skin body \/\nabstention diminish \/ Propaganda crosshatch\n\n        That is to say .. . mercantile .

A desire to reclaim certain arenas of contestation. Thus, a politics of writing is a politics of\nthe body is a politics of value and meaning. Mind is part of the body.

Gramsci . the quotidian \/ Marxism .\nDeaccumulationist demagogues . A structuralist view of language (and a view that enshrines this\nsystem of language as the medium of writing) may leave us too insistent on valorizing the signifiers.\nAnd the radical praxis that stems from this structuralist conception is one of linguistic subversion,\ndisrupting the signifiers, keeping them even more separable than usual from the signifieds to which\nthey are most often arbitrarily joined. The prescription (practice) follows from the explanation\n(theory). This also parallels a view in which power is restrictive. Power would seem to be localized in\na political apparatus, and this would have to be the target of attack. As if signifiers were the political\nsystem; \u2018smash the state'.\n\n         But, really, power is not so restrictive. It produces and orchestrates signifieds. It is not\nlocalized in any one institutional apparatus. It is a flexible technology of normalization (as well as\nexploitation), acting directly on value\/meaning, and therefore on the body. A social body that goes\nbeyond semiotics. A radical writing must get some distance on the sign, to avoid being trapped in a\nreflexive (and exhausting and exhaustive and didactic and \u2018experimental') opposition to the sign and\nits structure. 'Writing doesn't need to satisfy itself with pulverizing relations & discharging excess. It\ncan charge material with possibilities of meaning \u2014 not by demolishing relations but creating them,\nno holds barred, among units of language ... where meaning will insist on spinning out of the\nclosed circuit of the sign, to reach or act on the world (not only as it is, as it could be). Amnesia or\nblindness about this productivity of writing stands alongside the prevalence of individualized self-\npreening consumption.\u2019 This is not a brief for backtracking into a naturalism or socialist realism,\nreplacing one representation with another (ignoring the system of language and placing faith in\nreductionism). But neither is it cause for a vanguardism of attacking the state or storming the sign\nsystem. The parts of the sign are interlaced; so are the realms of experience and activity which the\nawkward terminology of the sign is supposed to reveal.\n\n         Renounce privileged signals .

It restricts by the very logic of\nthe old system of production* system of reproduction, monitoring : comes\nacross as alienating replication which devalues the work of writing.\n[Repression.] To split off desire or libidinal energy or whatchamacallit\nfrom such work \u2014 scrub off words, let preconstituted world of referents\n\n\nshine through.\n\n    Encyclopedia: Epistemology: arrange terms in alphabetical (\u2019arbi-\ntrary\u2019) order so that use, for units of information, leans upon an\naccepted outside context. This conventionally fills the gap between\nsignifieds (mental concepts) & references \u2014 relay between encyclopedia\n& the whole world (pretension of the former toward the latter \u2014\n\u2019comprehensiveness\u2019, \u2019fullness\u2019; just like any representational text).\n\n    Positivism : this imagined closure between concept & referred-to-\nthing-in-the-external-world. The rules for processing & combining data\ninto familiar patterns swamp the words\u2019 reality, as if we could maintain\na purity of ideas & information against the unfortunate (or disregardable)\ntribulations of their material inscription. Fixed concepts; lack of\nawareness of the provisional & reflexive character of knowledge; its\npractices independent of the knower (no one seems to need to do the\nunderstanding). Yet understanding (reading is analogue) remains an\nactive, material process (not naturally given, deductive, or disembodied).\nKnowledge is subjective intervention, not its stylish banishment.\n\n    Fetishism occludes this fact & this gap. History lesson embedded in\napparent choicelessness [fatedness, mystification, mythificationj of\nencyclopedic choices : CAPITAL expands & weaves reality around its\nquantifiable needs, becomes the criteria for use \u2014 is key : our key \/\nexpanded\/ our key become useful \/ deployed become different, becomes the\nstage set for meaning (i.e., DIFFERENCE \u2014 e.g., phonemics vs. phonetics).\n\n    Words then seem to be identified with their referents, NOT with\ntheir role in a framework of human conventions & NOT in a way that\nacknowledges their physical manifestation \u2014 world reified \/ sign dis-\nappears. Individual usage or creativity in language becomes a frill of\ninterpersonal relations & not the construction & revision of the norms\nthemselves. Meaning would become a mere spin-off from a taken-for-\ngranted external reality.\n\n    Yet Writing can articulate, brokenly, a world requiring our full\nintervention to be understood \u2014 i.e., cannot SOCIALIZE us. So, a\nheightened stress on individual usage \u2014 to break through the fetish,\nthe tyranny of the unmediated external itself [example : the \u2019optical\u2019],\nwhere we feel effortlessly & conveniently \u2019in touch\u2019 without first\nhaving to bring our full humanity to bear on forming connections with\nthe world, an \u2019easier\u2019 & more acquiescent (\"glossed out\") naturalism.\n\n    So, one alternative is a fuller insertion of individual practice\ninto the (writing) process by which these conventions are otherwise\ncontinuously reproduced through acquiescence in socialization.... An\nover-all non-representational ordering of matter \u2014 LANGUAGE \/ MATERIAL\n\u2014 as architecture of lexical associations & leaks, not \u2019tool\u2019.\n\n    Do this by furnishing, in a self-conscious way, the account not\n[the] object..

The sign; not the fetish of reference,\nwhich would be stapled to the text\u2019s compelling absences to offer\nillusory compensation, alienating us further (the myth of a self-standing\nreality : Every satisfaction of it is debt.) \u2014 the supplementary cured\nor dared.\n\n     For a true fit, we require mediation, an account (to answer \u2019Why?\u2019\nquestions contextually) \u2014 plan matters to be \/ appropriate. Otherwise\nworld just happens, w\/out enough self-reflection & becomes taken-for-\ngranted regard for use (splint them as they lay, etc.). Usage can\npenetrate the whole \u2014 if not it\u2019s defined as practicability, what fits\na paradigm; comprehension \u2014 the attempt to read opinion by complacent\nreliance on system    nuancing, ornamenting the standards derived from it.\n\n     Main opposition : between acceptance of rules (in this case, of\ncomposition, of positivist inquiry, of discourse) OR stress on indivi-\ndual choices & disruptions & deviations (flows) & perspectives to the\npoint where signs appear recognizably conventional. Thus : The whole\nstandard undoubtedly has been raised not to be nuanced, but made use of.\nFetish can be partially undone, seen to be constructed, ncrw acts as\n'function.

Rosmarie Waldrop\u2019s largest book in half-a-dozen years.\nShe stakes out for us, gradually, a parallel between 2 senses of traffic:\nthe movement (of vehicles or pedestrians) through an area or along a route\nand the information or signals transmitted over a communication system:\nmessages. So we find content doubled, folded back into the constructed\nspaces of the page \u2014 first, revealing and articulating an experience of\nmotion (and of mind\/heart\/memory\/body\/dream in motion through everyday\ntraffic): second, doing the same for an experience of speech\/words\/meanings\/\nwriting as this second perspective actively unfolds from a transciption\nand embodiment of the first. The writing entertains a constant retrieval\nfrom one plane to another. A bifurcation, which registers gradations in\nboth, trans la ting \/ one measurement into another\u2083 so that the intervals\nachieve solidity. We notice then that the facticity of the everyday\nworld is incomplete. Such a double vision is one of the book\u2019s achieve-\nments.\n\n     Comprehension (a sequence \/ of ready signs') bleeds through. It is\nperformed in a space & in intermittent shapes we can measure, as an\nabstraction we are obliquely conscious of. This abstraction is our ability\nto frame and reframe the flows around us, and the explosions which fracture\nthe present. Body becomes its own flow; the person is a matrix of those\nflows & exchanges & messages. Person is a communicative system, a traffic.\n\n     The mind floats headlights on time^ & transforms what is immobile\ninto a secret generation of desires and presence: words \/ germinate on\ntheir own obstructions. Syllables are implacable; they secrete their own\nspace, dislodging our breath at an angle. They congest in the unbroken\nslowness of the gaps they make, where mind speeds ahead of body, where\nperceptions become symptoms.\n\n     And don\u2019t those gaps \u2014 and the line breaks & disruptions which high-\nlight them \u2014 begin to remind us of another, more social gap?? A gap\nbetween our desires and our experience, between the outside which encloses\nus and the inside which projects and endorses us. damned-up friction \/\nknots want into \/ need widens : as if the future had to be \/ remembered\nwords. This resembles Ernst Bloch\u2019s idea of the novum \u2014 what \u2019\u2019has not\n\n\ncome to be in the past,... which is drifting and dreaming in the darkness,\nin the factual blue of objects... as content of the deepest hope.\u201d\n\n     This difference never happens without words \u2014 a tumescence which\nconsumes all representation in the affections of solid paper. Precisely\n& secretively \u2014 particularly here as the last word of a phrase often\nbegins a new physical line and a new grammatical unit; as if.intentions\nand conventions are bi-valved, perforated, condensed, accelerated, paral-\nleled: the \/ double sheet of the \/ way back of \/ the outside rises up.\nSurface \/ doubles the depth just as talk \/ doubles the frequencies. Both\nassert attention, weaving & unweaving, giving us the material enticements\nof text as well as a recollected sighting from a landscape \u2014 an outer\nlandscape which is not separate from the languagescape of the text. The\nflows we see \u2014 these sightings are not retinal flashes. We find them\nembodied, as the journey reapproaches the surface (the site of the struc-\nture) . Light is ink, a series of displacements taking shape against any\nobject, while words make you your own object.\n\n     Illusion dwindles into the page\u2019s margin. Yet the atomized self\ncannot live without these illusions. At times., the blue bodiless shock of\nthe air is too much for it. At best, writing canft find a center for its \/\nsurfaces superimposed in constant \/ articulation. At those points, all\nobstacles recede \u2014 both the taken-for-granted self and taken-for-granted\nillusionism. Otherwise (& this is the danger constantly tempted here)\nsurface bursts and yet still slackens into familiar versifying, where\ndisruptions seem ornamental, imagistic, comforting, rhetorical. A constant\nactivity would be a surface without grips \u2014 what is most courageously\ndesired, what accompanies \/ the tissue of pleasure inside \/ pleasure.\n\nBRUCE ANDREWS\n\n\n\n"},{"uid":"BruceAndrews_Layout_1978","author":"Bruce Andrews","shortTitle":"Layout","title":"Bruce Andrews | Layout | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn3\/pictures\/023.html","text":"\n\n        LAYOUT\n\n\n  Michael Frederick Tolson et al.., Untitled book, 50 pp., white\n  wrappers ($2, from Tolson, 53 W.

Am I getting through to you (and to you-plural)?\n\"Piercing the monocle ...because letters\". To pierce that, as letters\ncan pierce through: it isn\u2019t taking off or opening up shades, but re-\nmoving historical or social barnacles. Shades are painted shut.

Dialogues, in place of a fugitive \u2019mono-\n          logic,\u2019 as a means by which reality can be constituted. Parotes.

Communicative competence, and therefore transparency, and so-\n          cial reality itself: all together. What \"will teach you about men\u2014\n          what it means\"? \"Because what does anything mean,...?\" Yet is any-\n          thing \"wholly meaningless,\" or if so only by some constricted defini-\n          tion of meaning, one which sanctions only certainties, is transparency\n          or a phoney monologic. So \"the things I wish to say\" \u2014 are they ever\n          without obstructions or emotional overhead? For saying is not just an\n          utterance but a social performative as well. At every step, we perform\n          the dialogue.\n\n     5.       The borders & barriers & border patrols which it breeds all\n          remind me of those which translation must cross. And translation does\n          or can model all our interactions. Even so, there are problems, famil-\n          iar problems with this. \"All borders between men were closed.\" The\n          impermeability, again. So that the things we wish to say may even seem\n          motivated by a strong desire (the wish, the personal gesture, the camp)\n          yet in a contextual sense \"are needless,\" or else remain unmotivated or\n          undemanded in a formal sense.

Lately, I\u2019ve heard Ashbery\u2019s work mentioned in breaths that\n          include Lowell, Bishop, Sexton, Howard, Merrill, Strand, Rich, Hollan-\n          der, etc. A community of innocent and therefore more worrisome mis-\n          representation which poses as representation, as rhetoric. The work\n          at hand is less innocent. It does not content us as established rhe-\n          toric. \"More than the forms\". O.K. Yet this is still like a \u2019social-\n          work\u2019. It poses for us a radical questioning of established forms, yet\n          at the same time, and so appropriately in its own form, it explores the\n          implications of that questioning \u2014 not as an idea, but as an experie-\n          nce and a reading.\n\n\n      I came upon this work early in my writing. Rereading, it seems\neven less comfortably mentioned in that former breath of names, or\neven in a breath with the many younger writers who have adopted his\ntone and manner of discourse. Instead, it still persuasively proposes\na condition of formal adventure: with elements of Allen\u2019s New American\nPoetry 1945-1960, with the work of Roussel, Cage, Zukofsky, with\nO\u2019Hara, Eigner, MacLow, Roche, with what recent writing has done (that\nof Coolidge, Silliman, Mayer, Grenier, DiPaluu?, Bernstein, others) to\nhelp us take a new breath, and with what such writing may do to push\nus further along. Not a conventional dalliance, and not a transcen-\ndent avant-gardism. There are other communities, and this work and\ntherefore the possibilities for writing can belong in them. It has\nopened rooms, even if Ashbery\u2019s own work has not walked into them.\n\n      \"1 am toying with the idea.\" Yet we read more than \"only bare\nmethods\", the \"sharp edge of the garment\", \"the ....lettering easily\nvisible along the edge\". What is here: \"A torn page with a passionate\noasis\". \"Back into pulp.\" The construction itself bends backward, to\ngive us a clearance for the jumps in location and tone and pointed-\nness \u2014 a jump cuts like the narrative variety in New Wave cinema of\nthat time. Moreover, the construction is not a shawl, enveloping &\nsmoothing the shifts, as in later work, but is at the heart of our\nexperiencing those shifts at all \u2014 the jagged kaleidoscope of melan-\ncholia and expiration.                                           \n\n     7.       \"of course the lathes around\n          the stars with privilege jerks\"\n\nIt concerns the undercutting of the image, the visual picture \u2014by\njuxtaposing the conceivable referents in unexpected ways and also by\nfragmenting the syntax, that gridiron of outwardness. \"The reason\nejected\" by these 2 strategies\u2014via the constitution of the image and\nvia syntax, both of which are variously shattered. In fact, we could\nsay that only here and in Three Poems does the disjunct formal struc-\nture fully doubles or reiterate, the implicit lessons embodied in the\ndiscourse: about the fragility of relationships, doubts, breakage,\ntenuousness more generally, foreclosed dreams & the mortgages of dream-\nwork, lonesomeness. Not just an ornamentally rhetorical way of talking\nabout these issues; here we find them displayed and played out and\nencoded in the very construction. This is codic doubling with a\nlovely vengeance.\n\n     8.       Let light shine in? \"The bars had been removed from all the\n          windows\". But .... \"What window?\" What is at stake \u2014 \"A signal from\n          the great outside\" \u2014 is this all?: \"against the window.\" \"the ob-\n          servatory\"; \"specs\". These seem. Light and glass, as mirrors, as\n          representation, as lucid rhetoric. He\u2019s not wondering if we want this,\n          but is depicting actively what language can deliver. Are we willing\n\n\nto accept the ... available substitutes? Not our salvation.\n\n      Even to the point where language itself takes precedence \u2014 is\nthe frontal project. \"Inch pageant\". And single words are unleashed\nfrom a familiarity which their very unleashing helps to undermine. As\nwell, they constitute another reality. Signs & the rules they carry\ninside them. \"Now he cared only about signs.\" Well, not true, not\neven here, but he does care very deeply and seems suspicious of their\ninstrumental use, of their about-ness_, their external determinants.\n\"Panorama.\"\n\n     9.       Images, for example\u2014 or ornament. \"The colored balls were\n          like distant lights on the plaque horizon.\" Not enough, and not what\n          it is. \"Is not a \u2019images\u2019 ....to \u2019arrange\"\u2019. Not, actually it kicks\n          the legs out from under that whole project. Here, and more prominently\n          than in later work, the composition does not project such an arrange-\n          ment. It doesn\u2019t just juxtapose representations and accede to their\n          hegemony. No ...the reading, the language, \"does not evoke a concrete\n          image\". Still, you want to do more than abandon the possibility: \"You\n          have to exactsthe forfeit\". To do so, you may want to make these il-\n          lusory or suspect representations more exact; or question them in one\n          exacting fashion after the other. \"The light goes \u2014it exudes ....\n          Your idea\u2014perched on some utterly crass sign\". For isn\u2019t it always\n          some utterly crass sign or image on which it is perched, on which our\n          hopes are perched? Not what is in front of us. \"Photography, horror\n          of all\". As if humans were the miscommunicating mammals, or those who\n          locate themselves in frames which require so much more than what we\n          call simple reading, or \u2019reading off.\u2019 Instead, things are pleased by\n          indirection. \"He is not a man ... Who can read these signs\". Not in\n          this light.\n\n     10.      Isn\u2019t transparency a mark of illusion, and possibly of all\n          illusions? \"misguided\": the elysium of signposts, of exact replicas,\n          clones, control, repetition compulsion. \"You cannot illusion;\" this\n          remains as a trace of advice. Critical Interruptions. \"Lights stream\n          undeniably away\". Their touch eludes. You cannot recapture. And\n          light itself would be an evasion, or a misapprehension, and even the\n          other-worldly, the distractingly transcendent. If \"escape is over the\n          lighted steps ....Misunderstandings arise cathedral.\" The radical cri-\n          tique of religion as a source for an Ideologiecritik, and a critique\n          of clarity and transparency and language: \"powerless creating images\";\n          and hierarchy arising historically at the same time as instrumental\n          literacy (Levi-Strauss) or the incest taboo. Repent; revolt. In the\n          division of labor, some are left to dream. Are we left to repeat?\n\n      \"We might escape, in the daylight\". As if light comes across\nhere as an escape, \"the exit light\". Since aren\u2019t these the descrip-\ntive effects, the lighting, evoked around the edges of an experience\n\n\nin order to show an unreal way out? This project can be overturned:\n\"the undesired stars .... needed against the night ....Forbidden\ncategorically\". Yet how undesired are they, \"the fact the stars\",\nthe piercing through of night? Fugitive. Instead, in the dark, we can\npledge allegiance to them\u2014to these facts and to their absence.\n\n\n      And not to description. During that pledge of allegiance, these\nwords remain seated. \"But a blind man\u2019s come poking, however clumsily,\ninto the inmost .... corners of the house.\" Or the book. The reign\nof description is put on the dock; to place in evidence; to regard as\nhearsay; to impugn the testimony of. Its effects suggest mere posit-\ning: \"The apricot and purple clouds were\" \u2014while a welter of adjec-\ntives has not added up to an external world: cream-colored, lilac,\npink, lovely \u2014 but to what, a \"sullen, careless world .... Ignorant of\nme ...\" Even so, it contains within it such precisely evoked if dis-\nlocated pleasures and regrets, as if, in a whisper, to mention the\nincapacity of language to describe or fix. Badly mortised. \"Acting\nkind of contented in the finishing petal\". A fixation, an affixation.\nWhat is lost & what is mentioned becomes a parallel division.\n\n     11.      Description would be choiceless, \"unintentional\". Person-\n          hood might be mere transmission, \"am as wire\". Behavioral reading,\n          rather than hermeneutic ones. \"The persons abolished\"\u2014in the\n          horizon. Speech, and therefore action, reduced. \"Light sucks up what\n          I did\". But a critique in action of the representational capacity of\n          language seems to reaffirm personhood, and choice itself. \"For the\n          optician\u2019s lenses never told you\"; they never told you what you need\u2014\n          to go on\u2014and what can be said. But. \"Head of shade\"\u2014rather than\n          of light, or the evasion of responsibility, or crass signs & illusion.\n          \"But having plucked oneself, who could live in the sunlight? .... And\n          the truth is cold\". With the word \"plucked\" coming across as harvest-\n          ed, or tended, or having gained in self-consciousness; having done so,\n          it makes sense to be skeptical, to embody in composition the doubt\n          that transparency is more than a devious & second-best fraud, fraught\n          with an illusory naturalism, a making into nature what is really our\n          production. A tyranny, a myth, an ideology of determinism and reduc-\n          tionism. The work affirms, on the contrary, \"The person ....Horror\u2014\n          the morsels of his choice\".\n\n\n     12.      Some connectives. An order as clarity. Clarity as trans-\n          parency. Transparency as authority. Formal order, and civil order, &\n          the taboo against transgression, and isn\u2019t this a taboo against the\n          person? \"Glass .... regime\". With regime in the sense of paradigm, and\n          glass as transparency. A toppling of this regime; the delegitimation\n          of this authority, and this order, this reign, this rein, this probtema-\n          tique. \"For what is obedience but the air around us\": taking as its\n\n\nmodel a complacent glance upward & not the more strenuous effort to\nsee through hierarchy\u2014as a symptom, a veil.\n\n     Or to see through the \"solidifying disguises\" \u2014 the image, the\nrepresentation, the denial of solidity: \"Release shadow upon men\u2014in\ntheir heaviness\". Evanescence: fraud. \"It too faded into light\".\nAnd a horror emerges of fullness, of plenitude, of the body. \"Or he\nhides bodies .... stone night.\"\n\n     13.      Night & day, light & dark, chiaroscuro \u2089 present the basic\n          terms of reference. \"lighted up the score\". \"The sky was white as\n          flour\u2014\" And light appears as clarity, sense, clear-headedness, as the\n          possibility of both representation and denial: communication. Night\u2014\n          as lack of clarity, or senselessness, on the other hand. \"Neutral day-\n          light sitting thing\"; sitting things out, setting things up: a declara-\n          tion of placement, and order, sensible order, and its neutrality.\n          Simple declarative.\n\n\n     14.      But so much of this interrogates the lighting & our capacity\n          to see, and therefore to interpret,and therefore to speak and be under-\n          stood. \"Murk plectrum,\" \"thistles again closed around voice.\" Guarded;\n          blocked. \"Fatigue and smoke of nights\". Blurs; hard of hearing \"re-\n          cording of piano in factory\" or chickenshack, or garage. See each\n          other? \"Our faces have filled with smoke.\" \"As though too much dew\n          obscured the newspaper\". Film noir. \"bandaged the field glasses.\" Or:\n          \"The sunset stains the water of the lake,\" staining the otherwise see-\n          through flooring. Consensual truth? Transparency does not yet exist.\n\n     15.      Faced with the \"bilious tide of evening\", as an alternative,\n          are we left with \"thankless sight\"? \"The penalty of light forever\" \u2014\n          where we may be \"Burnt by the powder of that view\" which we desire.\n          Very possibly, this exit leads nowhere. \"One can never change the core\n          of things, and light burns you the harder for it.\" And at that core\n          would be personhood, or character armor, and therefore the impossibility\n          of unimpeded communication, of full relation and bonding, of getting\n          through. One \"sees .... Into the light: .... It grieves for what it\n          gives:\" or what it reveals. I am naked.\n\n\n      \"Lights were brought. The beds, sentenced.\" Where sentenced gives\nthat doubling of penalty and grammatical closure: the end. Or unending\nbut jeopardized from all sides ... \"mirrors \u2014 insane\" (which is one\nwhole section from the sequence masterwork, Europe). Giddyup, refer-\nences; into the horizon. And light, that seeming mark of transparency,\nwould only be a mark of seeming. A false front, a regret. It actually\nmarks opacity, and ... our full realization of absence. Clarity, in the\nend, is suffocating. Yet we suffocate for want of it, and still presume\n\n\nit. \"My bed of light is a furnace choking me\".\n\n     16.      Memory, too, gives us a system of reference. And opacity\n          gives us a system of amnesia, or a reminder of the mnemonic challenge;\n          \"it was fuzz on the passing light .... over disgusted heads, far into\n          amnesiac\". Eyes closed discover spent youth.\n\n     And that amnesia, or character armor, is not a needless intrusion\nbut emotion itself\u2014\"of our defences, our intentions\"\u2014where \"We must\nbe a little more wary\". \"and that fascinating illumination .... that\nburies my heart\". Occlusion springs from the heart as well as from\nlanguage. Daylight clarity poses the terms of the question again;\nwhere for\u2122 is pinned by sense\u2014only to be dissembled in its origins,\nits privacies.\n\n     17.      \"The map ... Shut up.\" No speech = privacy = no guides. Where\n          does the public\/private dimension enter in? \"Darkness invades the\n          tears\" & \"Tears invade the privacy of private lives\". For to invade\n          suggests embody\u2014the fear of embodiment, where privacy\/opacity and\n          publicity\/transparency are poles; they are poles apart. \"A strong\n          impression torn from the descending light ....But night is guilty.\"\n          Guilty of what we do, in private, and of the simplest facts of privacy\n          itself, \"darkness in the hole\". Guilty of the passionate oases. So:\n          private night, film noir, the disorder\u2014the voluptuous reassuring dis-\n          order of night, \"carpentered night\".\n\n     18.      And imagination. \"They imagine something different from what\n          it is.\" \"My brain concocted\" : \"and looking around for an opening in\n          the air, was quite as if it ....had never refused to exist differently.\"\n          And those differences are a form of social speech \u2014a source of contra-\n          diction, an interaction which lays the ground for our individual long-\n          ings and imaginings. Heating up the caverns, or \"the inconstant uni-\n          verse\"\u2014 \"a beam of intense, white light .... \u2014pierce the darkness,\n          skyward\".\n\n     For otherwise this was \"the issue utter blank darkness\" : night or\ndarkness or absence; zero. \"Bringing night brings in also idea of\ndeath\" : \"death preoccupation, beauty.\" A barely habitable humanism,\ncharacterized by opacity, motive, clogging, that which is not under-\nstandable; \"the darkness will have none of you,\" and \"I don\u2019t under-\nstand wreckage\". Wreckage occludes the orders of the day, the light\nwhich is conceivable speech. And ... \"but in the evening in the severe\nlamplight doubts come\".\n\n     19.      Clarity can thus be regarded in the same way we consider ease\n          of closure, understanding, sight, and translation. The but endistances\n          them: \"but permanent as the night\u2019s infection\" and doesn\u2019t this remain\n\n\nsurrounding us? Something has \"rendered speech impossible .... There\nwas no sign of light anywhere below \u2014all was a bright black void.\" All\nruses have failed.\n\n     As a compensation and yet also as a reminder, the style of this\nwork remains prophetic. The form reemerges from sense by dissemble-\nment, duration, extension of deadline, and personal project. Here is\nsubjectivity loose among the bleak structures and attempting to show\nthem up. It goes on \u2014into materiality, refusal, doubt, the artificial,\nthe negation & critique, the less-than-innocuous truths, perfume, and\nnights with neither warmth nor transcendence.

I dissolved into it) \u2014 differences, separation,\nabsence, meaning, all that. All part of the motion away from our mothers.\nThe gesture completed when we became the bigger boys and did some of the\nbeating. I could really identify with all those structures they put in\nmy head to get out of our heads what was there first. When I joined the\nsystem, the men made me one of them but to do that they had to make me\none a single solitary one to begin with. NOTHING TO DO BUT LIE HERE AND\nCOME APART. I knew it wasnt really my imagination that was making this\nscene it was the cops, the Law, who controls who, who even distributes\nthe name 'who' & who 'me'? and why why? We taught him our standards,\nwhich weren\u2019t ours. Secondhand\u2014you know the rules\u2014 ... I hate machines\nand systems... but I got to admit I\u2019m enjoying the respite.\n\n   Apprenticeship of language = alienation for me, each piece a solemn\ndedication to the whole \u2014 etc. \u2014 speech matrix \/ flow. Is the way we\nfeel normal stress how we're social & how social we are; socialized,\nnot socialists. We're like a speech, social life speaks right through us]\nif we normally feel this way, made normal \u2014 with fixed destination, exclu-\nsive assignments, flattened out. Even the atmosphere the textures we\ngrope around in are a system now not just pinpricks of the things you\nnotice yourself. The music then was a radio in the night, now it\u2019s a\nsystem.\n\n   When I hear all this talk about systems, I want to say: I don't take\ndictation. Conventions have limits, and there're dangers in being com-\nplacent or rhapsodic about them. The crudeness of socialized instructions\nneeds to let through, between the cracks, individual experience, flower,\nthe confusion of heads to unfold. How self-contained & closed-off is\nthis 'order of language' or 'Law of Culture'? What's in it that guaran-\ntees our desire, firsthand, to put together truth, or ethics, or confi-\ndence (unless they're just supposed to be byproducts of 'if all goes well'\nor 'I\u2019m like everyone else' or 'genital normalization' or 'that's taboo,\ndecadent, counter-revolutionary, etc.', etc.), etc.\n\n   If language is primary and everything we felt was central is really\nprefab & de-centered, then how does individual experience fit in, how can\nit loosen up these structures & punch through some barriers : these are\nsome questions : If systems are determining, then is poetry just 'showing\nlanguage at work' with language now fashionably defined as a system that\n'works'? They\u2019re always about themselves \/ (words) driving people away...\nOr are private worlds upfront & if you say they're 'constituted by lang-\nuage,\u2019 O.K., those who come apart first fill up the words later, but\nlanguage isn\u2019t some frozen merchandise. I'm a writer, it's writing, I'm\nproducing it, not just to show its obstacles (I\u2019m a generation of obsta-\n\n\n        cles) but to show them up, disassemble the fixed programs, not just be\n        marched along by them. One dude plays blues harp and makes up lyrics to\n        go with action as the arrests continue...\n\n   And all of our selves refusing to be subordinated to the selves most\nwidely recognized, aecep ted... To want a poetry that has room for me,\nknots & shields, my tunnels and locked doors. More than a byproduct of\n\u2019the law of one and all,' it starts with some me, our self importance,\ncollisions with speech, fragmented signature, then plugs in but only\nafterward, when I write, read it, me, then people can share it. Other-\nwise it\u2019s just the conventions of the culture apparatus make us all this\nway then get us to \u2019create\u2019 its way & feed us the need to make it, succeed.\nRemember when \u2019the system\u2019 had obvious negative overtones? Is this rage\nfor codes & systems & structuralism in the 70*smore than a tidying-up of\nour regret & frustrated longing for getting beyond it? And the people\nwho know see through the collage we constructed to show them we weren\u2019t\nwhat they said we would always be but were pieces of all the things we\nhad loved to see others make lives from...\n\n   Self-consciousness is being programmed out of existence \u2014 it 's all so\nsubjective, as they say \u2014 so, we\u2019re more insistent on it? And what\nother way can we see the world except as extensions of who we are or\nwould like to be ... Things meant or did not exist, they seemed to have\nto mean something beforehand, firsthand, I mean me, in my solipsistic\nuniverse, or writing didn\u2019t make them mean \u2014 HERE I AM; but this cant\nmean as much in words as it did in experience. If I record my raps,\nsometimes appearances, more like a transcript of heart on sleeve, speak\nlouder than words. Voice \u2014 breathless throw made, personalizing, into\na verse line, or a rush, a way of lacquering associations for you with a\npersonal speech and asides and memorabilia, the screens of our dreams\u2019\nimaginations, not just composing with them more freely but back to putting\na high note in the bar where my self is. Still, stressing me might at\nleast give writing a whiff of what defines \u2019us\u2019 struggling for autonomy\n(whether it's blacks, feminists, bisexuals, street queens, working class\nrenegades, or what) and in those struggles highlighting the person may\n(helpfully or unreflectively) be just sunk in the language of defense \u2014\nagainst what's deformed & pre-formed about what's outside (all the social,\nthe norms). We have our codes too, let's use them to interpret our exper-\nience in ways fhey 'll have to stretch to understand. \"\n\n   Now, some (usually white heterosexual American professional-class male)\nwriters write about 'the death of the author' or 'the de-centered self\nor how 'a system of signifying practices constitutes the subject as a\nprecipitate of unconscious discourse inscribed in response to the basic\nlack produced as the determinative network of oedipal triangulation super-\ncedes the imaginary identifications of the ego,' etc. They weren\u2019t\ntelling their stories. Well maybe their chance to go beyond the self &\n\n\ngive writing freer play is like class privilege \u2014 an elaborated code.\nStressing a me filters & squeezes what the writing does \u2014 it\u2019s a restric-\nted code, language that is accessible to the people I come from, but it\nallows me to speak to who 'I\u2019 need to speak to, including \u2019me\u2019: to\ndecrease that chasm of semantics.\n\n   The necessary extension. Not to be privatized in a single self because\nI didn\u2019t see how privatized even my attempts to make the self infinitely\nexpansive might seem to others less hounded by my need to be in everyone,\nto publicize a private mythology in order to share it, thinking I'm still\nin the movies, it\u2019s an outside telephone booth. To make me universal (I\ncome out with myself & find \/ everyone), not symbolically as a language\nso much as a pretty irreducible concrete thing, body, that can be anyone\neveryone displaced disguised \u2014 persona \u2014 mistaken for black, for gay,\nfor straight, for older, for younger for bigger for better for richer for\npoorer for stupider for smarter for somebody else,... I never talked\nabout making distinctions. He was him. I am 2 of us... spending much\nof my energy identifying with all kinds of people I wasn 't...\n\n   Shifters. To shift all around a lot, but a little in a vacuum, can\nnever fully accept that the firm ground for any pirouettes in writing is\nthe language proves itself. And if language is writing, it\u2019s writing\nwrit large not just this is about me now. In fact, there are no immediate\nfirst hand things in writing \u2014 not \u2019remembrance of my life\u2019 & not \u2019my eye\nball view\u2019. Everything\u2019s mediated, that is, it\u2019s written \u2014 this this\nthis. There\u2019s a whole complicated \u2019transformational process\u2019 separating\nmy \u2019private materials\u2019 from any publicity, since reading is social. Peril\nto ignore this. It\u2019s writing as the whole mediation, not distracted by\nsome shit or sex or need to be me and say it. That drawback is always\nfeeling the meaning (the sharing) has to pass directly through that filter\nof \u2019I\u2019 \u2014 an identification, an interpretation, a star system, making the\ndecisions for everybody, the audience was what he was fucking. Property\nis an extension of the self, if it\u2019s time and space that's mine forever.\nI must become less imperative.\n\n   Poets primary interest is not always Language more or less collec-\ntively, true, but where we begin is a simple love & growing understanding\nof language's hidden orders.

For\neven to get an exemplary grip on my selves I have to see how society &\nlanguage set up a context which produces the possibilities & limits the\nmeanings I can create, and you too.

Not a\nseparate but a distinguishing reality. Yet where is the energy invested?\n\nThere is nothing to decipher.\n\nThere is nothing to explain.\n\nTo engage in the collective task of creating a literature no longer\nfinds support on the scaffolding of discourse. In dismantling the scaf-\nfolding, we create a literature \u2014 a record of negative retrieval.\n\u2018Unreadability\u2019 \u2014 that which requires new readers, and teaches new\nreadings.\n\nAnything that is not a hypnosis is partial. No text, in that sense, is\n\u2018wholesome\u2019 \u2014 only experiences. Something is lost but something is\ngained. Not exactly \u2018deferentialist\u2019 \u2014 for can writing be adequately\ntagged with what it\u2019s not doing? Isn\u2019t that the old chest-busting\nnegativism of the avant-garde? Qualities are to be aufgehoben, not\nstricken. The sign\u2019s structure is for us by being before us; it does not\ndissolve into an outward looking system of radar, or of reading as\nradar. Reference isn\u2019t banished, except in the extremes of lettrism \u2014\nand here it even stays on as a reminder. Remember? Not \u2018formalist\u2019 \u2014\nfor does this display an obsession with form as apart from the full\npotential of language? All form is an expression and an inscription:\nhow personal can you get? how personal can you be? Form as physical,\nas material, as unlike the idea of elsewhere. \u2018Here\u2019 is more corporeal,\nsomehow, than \u2018there\u2019. Look over there = Avert your eyes. The here\nand now.\n\nThus, how do we read what is meant precisely to be read? that is\ngiven us for no other purpose, and without distraction (even those\ndistractions which we often take as the stigmata of\u2018reading\u2019 but are\nreally those of entertainment, those of good fog). Wordsome.\n\nAs though the referential fallacy and the pathetic fallacy were but\nspecial cases of each other. Desperate barriers against regret?\nPragmatic illusions. As though the world, or even the text, were a\nsimply structural density that could nourish us, alone. How com-\nmunal can you get? Show us a way out. The way out is not through\nthe basement door, getting lost among prerequisite cultural\n\nmementos, in deceptive (or descriptive) depth.\n\nPointing, or referential signification first signifies depth, or rein-\nforces the security found in possible depth \u2014 the pot at the end of the\nrainbow, the commodity or ideology that brings fulfillment;\nchoicelessness; a lower layer that is nature-like in its immobility or\nfixity or self-evidence. \u2018The fix is on.\u2019 It hypnotizes us with these\nexpectations, long before any particular content is unearthed. The\nformat massages us with its illusions \u2014 false bottoms, peek-a-boo\ncostumes, trapdoors, you have nothing to do with this.\n\nI am sawing the woman in half \u2014 I devour\none part, repress the other.\n\nCommodities are sold, productions are forgotten. You feed on this\nvertical system \u2014 the comfort of a semantic presence that you no\nlonger have the strength to get tired of, or wary of. You are learning\nthe trip, forgetting, as in an amnesia, the character of the places you\nleft. The medium, verticality, threatens to become the predominant\nmessage.\n\nSemantics: the souvenirs of tourism.\n\nCentripetal as vertical.\n\nDepth as set frame.\n\nContext as reference.\n\nHow much are we willing to destroy our attentiveness to the way\nwords act and interact in order to gain the advantages of description or\nof representation and a phobia toward what is present? Centripetal\nmotion is that of imposing contexts suitable for explanatory purposes\n\u2014 is this the one in the \u2018light\u2019 of which such actions are intelligible?\nThose impositions are usually cushioned by grammar (where syntax\nplays a representational role); without them, the language is a fron-\ntage. Not a false front, not a directive screen, but an unencumbered\nenergy.\n\nGrammar as constraining rules; meaning as constitutive rules \u2014 yet\nthese latter are not imposed as a prior dictate. They issue forth instead\nfrom the inward shapes of the language.\n\nGrammatical quicksand. Keep your place!\n\nSyntax: the scaffolding of verticality.\n\nMyth \u2014 the mask, the ideology, the technicolor escape, the promise of\n\ntranscendence in meaning. A regular reading has been a sideshow\npromoting semantic elixirs, imagist tonics. It\u2019s advertised to take a\nwhile to work: this delay between word and referent teases us; we\nreach the \u2018intent\u2019 or \u2018motive\u2019 only by indirection and without par-\nticipating fully \u2014 enjoying the temporariness of the trip. Coitus inter-\nruptus.\n\nThere is an other way. The vertical axis (downwards, as a ladder\ntempting us) need not structure the reading \u2014 for it does not structure\nthe text. This is what I would mean by calling it non-referentially\norganized writing, as a subset of language-centered writing. Hori-\nzontal organizing principles, without an insistent (that is to say,\nimposed) depth. Secret meaning is not a hidden layer, but a hidden\norganization of the surface. Not latent, but quite handsomely\nmanifest.\n\nMeaning is not produced by the sign, but by the contexts we bring\nto the potentials of language \u2014 not enforced by a vertical elevator, the\nmark of the double, the vacation. The impulse toward excavation,\ntoward contextual explanation, can be put in the background \u2014 for\nsuch a hollowing out of lower depths, of labyrinthine caves of\nsignification, goes on within the gaps.\n\nAll light, all in broad daylight: bring your own context. Radiant sur-\nfaces; myth.\n\nAn alternative remains \u2018wordness\u2019, \u2018eventism\u2019 \u2014 a way of\nreconstituting language by unpacking the tool box. The constitutive\nrules of meaning are not taking the words away from us. We can create\nthose rules as we go along, and as we return, centrifugally, to center,\ncentering, to surface, to degree zero, to sea level. We are urged back by\nthe absence of imposed escapes ! A semantic normality \u2014 a norm-iness\n(a worminess) is one such escape.\n\nSigns which are constituted from paradigmatic rules, from their\ninteraction (their play) with others, their trajectory without the dead\nweight of context.\n\nAtmospherically: what surrounds words may be more readily, and\nsatisfyingly perceived than an iron cage of connection: referential con-\nnections which take place below the plane, out of sight, or earshot,\ntherefore self-denyingly, without physique, or erotic delight.\n\nThe distinction between \u2018possession goals\u2019 and \u2018milieu goals\u2019.\n\nAs in lowering the iron cage beneath the waters to be attacked by\nsharks, to be eaten alive by outside forces. Obedience to Authority vs.\nthe improvisation of rules. If only the imposed representations could\nbe loosed, deviance would be so much sweeter.\n\nThe first real presence is the awareness of absence, of no escape \u2014 of\na vertical dimension acting only as an echo, a nostalgic reverb. No-\nthing is compressed from outside into familiar shapes & pleasing pas-\nsage \u2014 the inwardness is the site of compression & density.\n\nLanguage turns itself inside out for us.\n\nReversible vests; two-piece suits.\n\nSignifieds provide echoes, harmonies, overtones, but not the princi-\nples of organization; the signifiers take on an atonality without shy-\nness. There are external supports, but not protective blankets. Feet, not\nroots.\n\nEvents without trots.\n\nBottomless, negative space.\n\nConfusion of realms, profusion of events and interplay on the surface.\nAll, or mostly surface. The subject has disappeared behind the words\nonly to emerge in front, or inside them. Presentations of the present,\nnot representations of tense.\n\nA more complicated topology than the virtuosos of reference had\nimagined: Rubber-Sheet Geometry. The one-sided surfaces. Any two\npoints may be connected merely by starting at one point and tracing a\npath to the other without lifting the attention or carrying it over any\nboundary or separation.\n\nTransference. Differance. A carnival of ciphers.\n\nFragmentation doesn\u2019t banish the references embodied in individual\nwords; merely \u2014 they are not placed in a series, in grammar, in a row,\non a shelf. A more playful anarchy, a Mobius free-for-all is created.\nTexts are themselves signifieds, not mere signifiers. text: it requires\nno hermeneusis for it is itself one \u2014 of itself.\n\nGyroscopes.\n\nSelf-referring.\n\nOuroboros.\n\nThe consummation is concrete, graphic, erotic, physical, pheno-\nmenal, a greeting, not a keepsake. An absence embodied in a presence.\n\nWords hover above usage. Meaning is not use, or is not all use.\nMeaning is the enabled incapacity to impose a usage.\n\nExcommunication, rather than appropriation.\n\nWords are the ghosts of regret.\n\nReferentiality is diminished by organizing the language around other\nfeatures or axes, around features which make present to us words\u2019 lack\nof transparency, their physicality, their refusal to be motivated along\nschematic lines by frames exterior to themselves. Refusing to \u2018point\u2019,\nor to be arranged according to a \u2018pointing system\u2019, they risk the charge\nof being pointless. That is, to be a self-sufficiency of event \u2014 con-\nfounding the inadequation of words and referents that we mistakenly\ncall meaning. This is not meaning. Instead, this is meaning. This.\n\nIf explanation is contextual, this counter-explanation is a rebuff\nwhich shows a larger possibility \u2014 an emptied cipher that speaks of all\nthe productions we can fill it with. Each associative band, each band of\nsemantic radiation, takes place with less guidance from the games and\naims of representation or with little grammatical constraint. A carnival\natmosphere, therefore ... workers\u2019 control... self-management.\n\nCommodification, on the other hand, requires clear signposts \u2014\nEasy outs.\n\nLanguage-centered work resembles an active myth-making. It\nresembles a creation of a community and of a world-view by a once-\ndivided-but-now-fused Reader and Writer. This creation is not\ninstrumental. It is immanent, in plain sight (and plainsong), moving\nalong a surface with all the complications of a charter or a town-\nmeeting.\n\nA publicity.\n\nDepth is a spiral or whirligig \u2014 taken in stride, does not \u2018get in the\nway\u2019. Not a tourniquet.\n\nThe focus on the ways in which language can inscribe itself as other\nthan reference. As an individuation within (but not compensating for)\na community. Reading as a particular reading, an enactment, a\nco-Production. Here are the simultaneous co-creators of a smallish\nlinguistic community. A scriptorium.\n\nCounter-commodification: a barbaric, if politically apt term which\nspins around our scrimmages against reference.\n\nWriting as action; reading as action, not a behavior observed by a text,\nsitting there, bored, looking at us.\n\nBinary, with the text as switchman.\n\nBlurs, so fast = mesh\n\nTexts read the reader.\n\nAltering textual roles might bring us closer to altering the larger\nsocial roles of which textual ones are a feature, reading: not the glazed\ngaze of the consumer, but the careful attention of a producer, or co-\nproducer. The transformer, (capacitators? resistors?) Full of care. It\u2019s\nnot a product that is produce, but a production, an event, a praxis, a\nmodel for future practice. The domination of nature can find a critique\nhere as well \u2014 not in abstinence. Not aleatory.\n\nFrom each according to\n\nTo each according to\n\nA semantic atmosphere, or milieu, rather than the possessive\nindividualism of reference.\n\nIndexicality.\n\nAbsolute.\n\nAbsolution.\n\nSuch work has a utopian force only begun to be revealed.\n\nLanguage is an Other which imposed meanings attempt, luckily\nunsuccessfully, to disguise for us. The \u2018Primal Lack\u2019. Life against death.\nIt is not a monologic communication, but a spatial interaction fore-\ngrounded within a frame of our own generosity. Our gifts, its physical\nintegrity.\n\nStay inside. It is all here. The non-imperial state: without need for\nthe expansion or externalization that comes from the refusal to redis-\ntribute the surplus at home. The same holds for a non-imperial or\nlanguage-centered writing.\n\nSurplus of signifier = the floating signifier. Mana, trace.\n\nEngulfment, flooding of signifiers without predetermined signi-\nfication. Instead, the cliches of existentialism \u2014 freedom, surplus of\nsignifiers, choice as constitutive 8c we do it ourselves.\n\nPolitics not concealed any longer.\n\nDecontextualization.\n\nReferences evacuate the sign. In its place, intentionality fills it up \u2014\ncontributed both by reader and writer. This is a self-conscious (at\ntimes, self-referring) intention capable of acknowledging the Other, a\nsense of absence. It finds a cure in communal consort, in concert,\nwithout the mediation of obedience, without the orders of reference.\n\nWhat is made concrete is what is truly absent [unity \u2014 the world as one,\na toppling of Babel], and not what is tantalizingly withheld or delayed\nonly to be theatrically hawked and consumed [reference \u2014 the world as\nsplit, the divisiveness and\/ or repressiveness of outside imposed con-\ntent] Repression as the delayed gratification of unity.\n\nWorks seem the embodiment, the bodying forth of this string of\nlights connecting reader and writer, reader and text. We speak of a\n\u2018body of work\u2019 \u2014 by this, what do we mean: the body politic, love\u2019s\nbody. Embodiment is the needed copulation \u2014 of practices. No longer\nrepressed, the two spheres are fused.\n\nAs if the references offered could be known, through the act of\nappropriating them! Representation is ownership. Yet the meant (the\nsignifers) completely outdistances the known (the signifieds, what is\nreferred to). We come, historically, for the sake of a denying and\nrepressive order, to be satisfied with what can be known, owned,\nconsumed, referred to, easily intersubjectively communicated, pre-\ndicted, controlled. Lost are some of the physical ways of intending, of\nexpressing, of meaning, of motion, of pronouncing, sobbing: the\noverabundance of signifier, the excessive presence, the unconscious,\nthe sign\u2019s arbitrary nature. Otherliness \u2014 we are emancipated only by\nrecognition, or, occasionally, by the conjugation of reading and\nwriting, in completing language\u2019s own work and words. Not duality.\nReaders do the rewriting. Sometimes they do enough to give a social\nforce to the absences they are first given.\n\nReferences are not foregrounded. The body of work is not\norganized around the referential axis. Therefore, is not genitally\norganized? No \u2018discharge\u2019 of a specific substantive kind leaves the\npolymorphous play of the linguistic units. The genital organization is\nmonarchic, or mimetic (from the family circle). Language-centering\nseems to capture some of the more exploratory aspects of the con-\nsequences of itself, without referential guidance, without parental gui-\ndance, without tense. Not a compensation, or its prime model: ego\narmor.\n\nWhat is collective as signifier as unconscious \u2014 does not atomize or\nindividualize in the ways references have. Lost \u2014 through a castration\ncomplex, an incestuous access eliminated by the triumph of market\nconditions and kinship, an imposed outward order of signification?\n\nHow have we come to the words, to our selves, our absenting\ncommunity \u2014 all flesh, all fleshed together.\n\nThe community which is unified, self-contained, mercantilist,\nunwilling to break down into spheres \u2014 resisting the division of labor\n(and hierarchy) that comes with literacy. Is this an incestual nostalgia\n\nfor illiteracy? A polymorphous lettrism, a movement into script,\ngrapheme, syllable, cipher, glyph, gloss, corpus?\n\nReaders embody texts.\n\nPhysical language."},{"uid":"BruceAndrews_WritingSocialWorkPoliticalPractice_1979","author":"Bruce Andrews","shortTitle":"Writing Social Work & Political Practice","title":"Bruce Andrews | Writing Social Work & Political Practice | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/003.html","text":"\n\nBRUCE ANDREWS :\n\nWRITING SOCIAL WORK & POLITICAL PRACTICE\n\n\"Language is practical consciousness\" (The German Ideology). Mainstream\ncriticism still fails to raise or demand an answer to key questions about\nthe nature of the medium\u2014which remains the modernist project for an\nart form. So, talking about writing, we have different ways to charac-\nterize its medium, different ways that medium\u2019s distinguishing qualities\ncan be acted upon. Different political practices & epistemologies are\nimplied.\n\nONE\n\n     One mode of writing tips its hat to assumptions of reference, repre-\nsentation, transparency, clarity, description, reproduction, positivism.\nWords are mere windows, substitutes, proper names, haloed or subjugated\nby the things to which they seem to point. \u2019Communication\u00b9 resembles an\nexchange of prepackaged commodities. Here, active signifying is subordi-\nnated, transitive. Its continuing constitution of the world is ignored.\nSo are the materiality of words & the conventions by which they get\ngenerated. Words are mistaken for tools (if only they could disappear\nto make way for meanings that sit outside language). Our concepts or\nmental pictures are confused with referents & referents are attributed a\nsecure identity that precedes their delivery into thought & words (the\nconventional nature of that relation is also ignored). An illusionism,\nthe taken-for-granted, the fetish. An imagined \u2019oppositional\u2019 poetics\nstemming from this perspective would still be reductionist, naturalism\n(a breakdown theory, reformism, \u2019socialist\u2019 \u2019realism\u2019). Or else poetry\nbecomes complacent literature, ornamental reinforcement of the status quo.\nTWO\n\n     An alternative structuralist view. Here the medium of writing is\nlanguage, understood as a system. The structure of the sign determines\nthat medium\u2019s intrinsic & distinguishing characteristics: the division\nof the sign into a signifier (material form) & a signified (concept or\nmental representation), the former related arbitrarily\/conventionally to\nthe latter. Word matter is not dissolved by reference but exists rela-\ntionally within an overall sign system. Signification occurs negatively,\nthrough difference & opposition\u2014terms signify by being differentiated\nfrom all other terms, not intrinsically or transparently.\n\n     Just as representational literature (dominant form) rests on an\nimplicit definition of words as largely transparent tools of reference,\nother kinds of writing practice correspond to this second, relational\n\n\ndefinition of the medium (sign\/language). It could be a cataloging ot\nthe properties of the linguistic system, a didactic or playful yet still\ndependant practice. More radically, the poetics would be those of\nsubversion-, an anti-systemic detonation of settled relations, an anarchic\nliberation of energy flows. Such flows, like libidinal discharges, are\nthought to exist underneath & independent from the system of language.\nThat system, an armoring, entraps them in codes & grammar. Normative\ngrammar--r a machine for the accumulation of meaning seen as surplus\nvalue & for territorializing the surface relations among signifiers by\nconverting them into an efficient pointing system\n\n     The coherence between signifier & signified is conventional, after\nall\u2014rather than skate past this fact, writing can rebel against it by\nbreaking down that coherence, by negating the system itself. Result: an\nexperimentalism of diminished or obliterated reference. This would\ndeliberately violate the structure of the sign, make the signifieds\nrecede even more from the foreground occupied by supposedly autonomous\nsignifiers. Characterizing the medium this way, we can find a brief\nfor actually instituting opacity, promoting a spillage or dissemination\u2014\nNot from caring about message or meaning, but caring about the erup-\ntiveness of material being put into distinctive relationships. So: a\nspectrum stretching from \u2019stylistic display\u2019 work to a more disruptive\npolitical work\u2014within the mostly self-contained linguistic system, of\nthe sign.\n\n     Writing can attack the structure of the sign after declaring that\nsettled system of differences to be repressive. But there\u2019s an ironic\ntwist here. The Blob-like social force of interchangeability & equiva-\nZence (unleashed by the capitalist machine, and so necessary to the\ncommodification of language) precedes us: it has actually carried quite\nfar the erosion of the system of differences on which signification\ndepends. It\u2019s reached the point where a coercive organization of grammar,\nrhetoric, technical format & ideological symbols is normally imposed in\neveryday life to even get these eroded differences to do their job any\nmore (an assembly line to deliver meaning, of certain kinds). So to call\nfor a heightening of these deterritorializing tendencies may risk a more\nhomogenized meaninglessness (& one requiring even more coercive props) \u2014\nan \u2019easy rider\u2019 on the flood tide of Capital.\n\n      A calculated drainage of the referential qualities of individual\nwords, for example, may deviate from established rules in a revelatory\nway, yet still abdicate the central struggle over meaning. That remains\nto be fought over the fetish, over myth & ideology, the representations\n& consumptions of fixed meanings.\n\nTHREE\n\n      Whether we bypass the referential fetish by writing non-signs or\nwhether we tackle & problematicize it depends, again, on how we define\nthe medium. Writing is actually constitutive of these underlying libidi-\n\n\nnal flows; it IS the desire for meaning, if not message. This is a\nthird characterization of the medium, acknowledging the usefulness\nof the second one but acknowledging its limitations also.\n\n     Here, the distinguishing quality of writing is the incessant (&\npotential) production of meaning &_ value. Created through the articu-\nlation of writing, which is neither a representational positing of \u2019\u2019the\u201d\nworld by imitation of signifieds nor simply a dizzy surface play of\nsignifiers. Meaning isn\u2019t just a surplus value to be eliminated\u2014It\ncomes out of a productive practice. Not passively, as a derivative of\na system of differences (pre-defined) prior to composition. C Even obses-\nsive attack & clever derangement may seem derivative^ Instead, active \u2014\nback & forth: a relay constantly making contexts out of a fabric of\nmarkings: writing & reading.\n\n     Those ideologies & fixed meanings can be reinforced (1.); or blown\napart by wild schizzed-out eruptions (2.); or they can also be opposed\nby (3.) a political writing practice that unveils demystifies the crea-\ntion & sharing of meaning. That problematicizes the ideological nature\nof any apparent coherence between signified & referent, between signified\n& signifier (for example, by composing words around axes other than\ngrammar\/pointing function\u2014). C By contrasting example, see how familiar\nsocial ways of (verbs: to contextualize, naturalize, commodify, fetish-\nize, make instrumental) language only shrink the theatre of meaning \u2014\nlay down a law, a lie, a line, a grammar, a code, illusion. Writing as\nCritique.J Not to make the words or signifiers provocatively opaque\nirrelevant, but to stress their use value & productivity in the face of\nmechanisms of social control.\n\n     Writing doesn\u2019t need to satisfy itself with pulverizing relations &\ndischarging excess. It can charge material with possibilities of\nmeaning\u2014not by demolishing relations but creating them, no holds\nbarred, among units of language (even when these seem superficially like\na pulverized normality). These relations are constitutive & germinative\nof meaning. A practice, based on this definition of the medium: to\ncreate conditions under which the productivity of words & syllables &\nlinguistic form-making can be felt, & given aesthetic presence.\n\n     To make the word the basis of extensions. Instead of a derivative\n(sublimate) of previously established connections, the word as \u2019\u2019the\ndwelling place,\" where meaning will insist on spinning out of the closed\ncircuit of the sign, to reach or act on the world (not only as it is, as\nit could be). Amnesia or blindness about this productivity of writing\nstands alongside the prevalence of individualized self-preening consump-\ntion. Socialisms \/ necessary but not sufficient conditions. Yet\nonly a dramatic change in the structure of capitalist society is likely\nto disorganize the fetish, the narrowness of readership (& therefore the\ncapabilities of writing), the dominance of ideological restrictive\nnotions of what poetry & language can be. To politicize\u2014not a closure\nbut an opening.\n"},{"uid":"BruceAndrewsandCharlesBernstein_ThePoliticsoftheReferent_1980","author":"Bruce Andrews and Charles Bernstein","shortTitle":"The Politics of the Referent","title":"Bruce Andrews and Charles Bernstein | The Politics of the Referent | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":null,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEsupp1\/pictures\/001.html","text":"The Politics of the Referent\n\nThe following four articles are part of a symposium edited by Steve\nMcCaffery on \"The Politics of the Referent. 11 The essays3 which date\nfrom 19 76, were originally published in the Canadian journal, Open\nLetter (edited by Frank Davey) in the summer of 1977 (Third Series, No. 7).\n\nIt seems worth remembering , in looking back on these essays, that the\ntendencies in writing McCaffery is talking about under such headings as\n1language-centered1 are as open to the entrapments of stylistic fixation\nas any other tendency in recent poetry.

Reading\na.k.a. ii is like being on a teeter-totter: \"The screen lit up.\u2019\u2019\n\"effect piles up\" \"The rock sank.\u00b9\u00b9 \"The gorge below.\u00b9\u00b9 \"but at full\nthroat up there.\" \"Ideal city cranked up to heaven.\" \"There would be\nan up a down a back and forth.\" We are moving, running, playing base-\nball. We are \"a group of boys\" faced with \"a brutal necessity to add\nup to one.\" Identity continues to splinter and refract.\n\n     Moving fast because \"The future was the easy way out.\" The future\n\"was\" and not the future \"is\" puts sadness in this. \"Nostalgia precedes\nthe focus.\" \"A burnt offering sadly loving its milk.\" As usual in\n\n\nPerelman\u2019s work, the ego is gently mocked\u2014by the word \u2019\u2019its\u201d in the\nabove quote and elsewhere in such lines as, \u2019\u2019The echoes bouncing back\nas a series of tightening categories inhabited by a big personal person.\u201d\nIn Braille Perelman said, \u2019\u2019The best myth we have is the nameless pulse.\"\na.k.a. ii is this myth\u2019s story.\n\n     Expectations of linearity are also mocked. He thinks he is pro-\nceeding in an orderly way and laughs at himself for thinking so. \u201d1\nwoke up ten times in a row, twelve, twenty. It was a winning streak and\nmy smile couldn\u2019t have been quicker to come and go.\u201d \u201d1 listen to the\ncorrect, calm sequence and am a ring.\u201d \"Sequence wakes up in the dark\nupset.\" This is the same moral universe found in a.k.a. i. Personality,\ncontinuity and abstraction (\"An element substituted for another via the\nsimple authority of say so...\u2019\u2019) threaten to separate us from real ex~\nperience.

This entails representation. Often they feel too much anger to\n   participate in the analytical tendencies of modernist or \u2019\u2019post-modernist\u201d\n   art. This was an obvious answer. The more I thought about it the less\n   it explained anything important. Most male writers aren\u2019t language-\n   centered either. Why don\u2019t more men do language-oriented writing?\n\n        Several months later, by mail, I was asked to write an article\n   explaining why women don\u2019t produce language-oriented works. The letter\n   suggested I might elaborate on the answer I\u2019d given before. But it wasn\u2019t\n   the same question! Some female writers do focus on language. Was I being\n   asked to justify their exclusion from consideration? Lyn Hejinian, Berna-\n   dette Mayer, Alice Notley, Susan Howe, Hannah Weiner, Carla Harryman, Lynne\n   Dreyer, Joanne Kyger, Anne Waldman and Maureen Owen seem, to one degree or\n   another, language-oriented. Of course, that\u2019s a tricky term. If it\u2019s\n   taken to mean total non-reference, these women don\u2019t fit. Neither, however\n   do Ron Silliman, Barrett Watten, Bob Perelman, Ted Greenwald, Charles\n   Bernstein or Bruce Andrews.\n\n\n        To believe non-referentiality is possible is to believe language can\n   be divorced from thought, words from their histories. If the idea of non-\n\n\n   reference is discarded, what does language-oriented mean? Does it simply\n   designate writing which is language-conscious (self-aware)? If so, the\n   term could be applied to a very large number of writers. Anyone who sees\n   the way signifier intertwines with signified will pay close heed to the\n   structures of language.\n\n         Susan Howe calls our attention to the effect of linguistic structure\n   on belief when she writes\n\n\n               as wise as an (earwig, owl, eel).\n\n               as sober as a (knight, minstrel, judge).\n\n               as crafty as a (fox, cuckoo, kitten).\n\n               as smooth as (sandpaper, velvet, wood).\n\n               as slippery as an (accident, eel, engine).\n\n               as straight as an (angle, angel, arrow).\n\n\n(The Western Borders, Tuumba Press)\n\n\n    And a minstrel may very well be more clear-headed than a judge. It\u2019s\n   important to note this.\n\n         Howe\u2019s passage amounts to a polemic against the influence of habit.\n   This specific concern is common in language-oriented work. When Carla\n   Harryman writes,\n\n\n               Although temperature flags on its own, the past\n               dissolves. I wanted to settle down to a nap. The\n               sand settles at the bottom of the ocean. I sink\n               to the top of the water.\n\n\n(\"Sites,\u201d Hitts magazine #4)\n\n\n    the word \u2019\u2019although\" prepares the reader for a contradiction between the\n   clauses in the first sentence. When no contradiction follows, the\n   reader\u2019s attention increases. The concept of contradiction is rooted in\n   the laws of logic, cause and effect. Harryman wants to throw these \"laws\"\n   into question. There is the jar of discontinuity between the clauses,\n   sentences and paragraphs in this work. The lines I quoted do not follow\n   logically, but they are united linguistically by the near-synonymous verbs.\n   Harryman puts content at odds with syntactical (or sometimes narrative)\n   structures in order to make these structures stand out, enter our\n   consciousness.\n\n         Although Lyn Hejinian uses syntax in a fairly conventional way, her\n   work is less referential than that of most of the writers I\u2019ve mentioned.\n   Of course, her writing does \"say things\" about the world, but the signifi-\n   cance of these statements is not what interests her. In her book, A Mask\n\n\n    of Motionj she rings the changes on a number of phrases and words. Each\n   usage of a word becomes a mask for its other uses. Context, placement\n   are of prime importance. When she writes \"of the yapping distances, the\n   extended return\" one hears the dog she introduced five pages earlier.\n\n      Howe, Harryman and Hejinian are very different, yet the term\n language-oriented might be applied to any of them. I use that term but\n I\u2019m suspicious of it, finally, because it seems to imply division between\n language and experience, thought and feeling, inner and outer. The work\n I like best sees itself and sees the world. It is ambi-centric, if you\n will. The writers I like are surprising, revelatory. They bring the\n underlying structures of language\/thought into consciousness. They spurn\n the facile. Though they generally don\u2019t believe in the Truth, they are\n scrupulously honest about the way word relates to word, sentence to\n sentence. Some of them are men and some are women.\n\n\n                                                    RAE ARMANTROUT\n"},{"uid":"LuigiBalleriniandRichardMilazzo_TheMonologicalMirror_1980","author":"Luigi Ballerini and Richard Milazzo","shortTitle":"The Monological Mirror","title":"Luigi Ballerini and Richard Milazzo | The Monological Mirror | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/035.html","text":"\nTHE MONOLOGICAL MIRROR\n\nTHE NO ONE, Unwritten (1979; The Press, El Gizeh; gratis)\n\nThis book addresses the sensuous and invisible difference of mythos and\nlogos, sustaining the motion away from symmetry and away from the spiral.\nA stationary motion in which the \"faring-well\" does not entail the whirl-\npool of arrival.\n\nSymmetry and spiral are the two inherited forms of the mirror: in the\nfirst, an object is re-flected into its image; in the second, the object\nis de-flected into its analogon. If symmetry freezes the mirror into a\nsimilarity of objects, and if the spiral (the baroque form of symmetry)\nis the oscillation of the mirror between two dissimilar objects, then\nneither can be said to attain the condition of the monological mirror.\n\nThe activity of the monological mirror defeats the duplicity of both\npleonasm and tautology as pleonasm, while setting forth, through tau-\ntology as predication, the hypostasis of transcendence (red is red,\nwhere the predicate red, however, is not red).\n\n\nThe metaphorical value of the etymon in the predicated noun (the red)\ninaugurates the difference burgeoning out of the verb of predication (is\nis not).\n\nThe presence of predication in tautology articulates the monological\nmirror which, by transcending the inclusive devices of symmetry (image)\nand spiral (analogon), constitutes the possible world of exclusion.\nWhile this mirror negates the double, it admits the double as negation\nand therefore as cruelty (Artaud).

He is\n   also a Buddhist, a pacifist, and an anarchist who votes. His writing and\n   performances are organized by systemic processes, with more or less space\n   allowed for pure invention in varying degrees.\n\n         His early training and work, as follows: he was born 1922 in\n   Chicago, attended the University of Chicago, specializing in philosophy\n   and structural criticism, and Brooklyn College in Classical Greek. He\n   has been writing poetry, music, plays, prose pieces, and criticism since\n   1937, and after 1954 combined these arts, as well as theater, dance, and\n   visual arts, in group performance works he calls \u2019simultaneities\u2019\u2014 as\n   well as in solo performance works\u2014while continuing to compose poems,\n   music, plays, and visual works (drawings, paintings, videotapes).\n\n         Throws of a die in 1954-55 selected isolated works from the bible\n   to comprise lines of MacLow\u2019s first major series, his 5 biblical poems.\n   At this same fertile period he developed two other techniques he used in\n   constructing later pieces. He constructed a long poem by working out a\n   system of correspondences: assigning a different word (drawn from a nine-\n   teenth century natural history text) to each pitch of Guillaume de\n   Machault\u2019s motet \u2019\u2019Quant Theseus.\u201d His simultaneity performances (in which\n   more than one thing is going on at the same time) had their roots in the\n   last of his 5 biblical poems, in which instructions permitted three\n   particularly long lines to be read simultaneously by three performers.\n\n        In 1958 he found a quick alternative to dice, cards, and coins for\n\n\nproducing random behavior in the form of the RAND Corporation\u2019s A Million\nRandom Digits with 100^000 Normal Deviates. With these tools he composed\nstanzaic pieces derived from Buddhist texts and drew \u2019\u2019word strings\u201d\n(chains of words) from de Sade\u2019s The Bedroom Philosophers to form the\nSade Suit.\n\n        The Marrying Maiden > a theater piece, was also written in 1958, its\n  text taken from the I Ching. Any performers\u2019 impulses for staginess were\n  quashed by stage directions, determined randomly, for amplitude, tempii,\n  and tone of delivery.\n\n        In simplest form, his acrostic pieces, begun in 1960, drew words,\n  word strings, or sentences from a given text by using the first letter of\n  each word in the text\u2019s title as an index to selecting lines from the text\n  to form the poem. In its hundreds of pages, MacLow\u2019s book Stanzas for\n  Iris Lezak explores hundreds of variations on this procedure.\n\n        The lyrical Light Poems, begun in 1968, are free in form and repeat\n  the names of kinds of light throughout their lines. The lights are drawn\n  by various systems from a chart of 288 kinds of light.\n\n        MacLow began writing his gathas in 1961; they can be divided into\n  several strains, all notated on graph paper. The mantraic gathas situate\n  the words of mantras, usually vertically and horizontally. The non-\n  mantraic gathas situate words taken from Kathy Acker\u2019s The Childlike Life\n  of the Black Tarantula #3. Each of his vocabulary gathas are based on one\n  of his friends\u2019 names. Another kind of piece, called a vocabulary (but\n  not to be confused with his vocabulary gathas), was first begun in 1968.\n  It draws words from the letters found in a person\u2019s name, using some or\n  all of the available letters. The vocabularies are written by hand,\n  crowding the paper with words of all sizes pointing in every direction.\n  He considers this form a crossbreed of light poems with gathas. These\n  pieces are sometimes performed with instruments as well as voices, by\n  performers situated around the room, their choice of words and intona-\n  tions left up to their own personalities.\n\nBARBARA BARACKS\n\n\n\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY: The Pronouns\u2014A Collection of 40 Dances\u2014For the Dancers\n  (1964; N.Y., mimeo; photocopy, $3 from MacLow, 80 North Moore, NYC 10013;\n  1971, Tetrad Press, London, with graphics by Ian Tyson; revised edition\n  forthcoming, Station Hill Press, Barrytown, N.Y. 12507).

MAX BENSE\n\nWe find ourselves in a strange time when various literary experiments happen to be at two opposite\nextremes of the same scale. In one sense, one can play at reassembling always broader syntactic unities\nwhich become more and more normal and thus obtain a sort of neoclassicism. In the other, one can\nproceed in the always more daring fragmentation of simple unities: from the word, to the syllable to\nthe phoneme and even beyond; i.e. beyond the utmost possibilities of the written character and its\ntotal consistency. Whether it is entrusted to a sound or to a graphic mark: with the fascinating\nconsequence that in this last case we also move out of the sphere of literature and invade that of\npainting and of sound (of music).....\n\nSpatola considers it an essential exercise to correct the 'candor' and the false pretenses which one\ncould have in doing linear or literary poetry: as if the macro-unities which are present in it were not\nbased on intraverbal micro-unities; as if the spirituality that one acknowledges in it were not founded\non a material basis. Here, then, we have a division of roles between literature-spirit and literature-\nbody: between rhetorical poetry (because it uses figures of speech, analogy, asyndeton, etc.) and\n'concrete' poetry, i.e. a poetry which addresses itself to the analysis of the material base of language; a\npoetry which has decided, following this path, to move out not only from the boundaries of the\nliterary, but also from those of the literal (as I have observed) to invade the fields of the visual and\nsound arts. On the other hand it is very difficult to find the precise joint where the influence of the\nliteral stops (in its linguistic aspects): i.e. where the 'matter of the expression' ' to use Hjelmslev's\nterms, does not result in being any more correlated to a form, but presents itself as matter, simply\nmatter, be it graphic or phonetic ..... When does the pull of the literal stop in the works of Spatola?\nWhen do we start realizing that the compulsion to read has become irreparably useless and ridiculous,\ni.e. that the 'collection\u2019 of units of sense is worthless?\n\n\n\n  Excerpted from the afterword to Zeroglyphics by Adriano Spatola and translated by Paul Vangelisti (1977: The Red Hill\nPress, c\/o SBD, 1784 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, CA 94709, $3).\n\n\nFirst of all in the fact that the graphic layout to which the gesture of writing is entrusted is still rather\nclose to typography. He could have adopted handwriting, definitely private and therefore gestural and\nmateric, very distant from public and codified forms. For these first experiments he has instead\npurposely chosen characters as anonymous and standard as possible, very large, bold-faces as in\nnewspaper headlines or advertising copy. And, secondly, this breaking up of writing is rather clear\nand elementary. It is done following directives which maintain a rational air, not at all dissimilar to\n\n\nthe vertical and horizontal grid on which the normal type case is based. With a pair of scissors, that\nis, one cuts along vertical lines the graphic sequence of words, reducing them to slats of a shutter and\nalso eliminating the \u2018white spaces\u2019. In fact, one must not forget that normal readability is based as\nmuch on full as on empty spaces, or intervals. In our case, instead, with an implosive effect, the\nintervals are abolished, the materic \u2018quantums\u2019, the entire nuclei get closer to each other; just as\nphysical matter would concentrate in a 'black hole' if the orbit of rotation of the electrons were\nprogressively reduced.\n\nBut besides the vertical cut up, there is also a horizontal one, which creates many squares as in a\nchessboard. It is natural that each one of these squares should undergo a rotatory movement; i.e.\nshould go and take up a different orientation than the one it originally had; reading expands itself, it\nspreads and disperses towards the four cardinal points of the horizon. To be sure it is a dissemination\nthat for the time being takes place to a moderate degree, as in the case of a person whose eyes are\nblindfolded and who, in moving about in a room, tries to maintain a sense of direction by calculated\nand moderate movement. If one wished to, one could obtain much wilder degrees of centrifugation\nof the meaning, taking an irreversible road from which there is no coming back. But this will\nspecifically be the job of those artists for whom what really counts is the plastic and graphic effect one\nobtains dispersing the fragments of writing. In Spatola's case, instead, it is important, that, as I have\nalready mentioned, the light of the literal should keep on descending, also to these sufficiently 'low'\nregions. At the same time the road back to the surface must be kept open, so that from the literal one\nmay even rediscover the literate, with its figures of speech and its multiple meanings. However, after\ncoming and going, after the immersions and the emersions, these will seem the ever more casual,\nunstable and bizarre results of a sort of combinational analysis.

It\nretains only the outward shape of relationships, their music, but not\ntheir reality. The Word shines forth above a line of relationships\nemptied of their content, grammar is bereft of its purpose, it becomes\nprosody and is no longer anything but an inflexion which lasts only to\npresent the Word. Connections are not properly speaking abolished, they\nare merely reserved areas, a parody of themselves, and this void is\nnecessary for the density of the Word to rise out of a magic vacuum, like\na sound and a sign devoid of background, like 'fury and mystery '.\n\n     In classical speech, connections lead the word on, and at once carry\nit towards a meaning which is an ever-deferred project; in modern poetry,\nconnections are only an extension of the word, it is the Word which is\n'the dwelling place', it is rooted like a fans et origo in the prosody of\nfunctions, which are perceived but unreal. Here, connections only\nfascinate, and it is the Word which gratifies and fulfills like the\nsudden revelation of a truth.... Fixed connections being abolished, the\nword is left only with a vertical project, it is like a monolith, or a\npillar which plunges into a totality of meanings, reflexes and recollec-\ntions: it is a sign which stands. The poetic word is here an act without\nimmediate past, without environment, and which holds forth only the dense\nshadow of reflexes from all sources which are associated with it. Thus\nunder each Word in modern poetry there lies a sort of existential\ngeology, in which is gathered the total content of the Home, instead of\na chosen content as in classical prose and poetry. The Word is no\nlonger guided in advance^ by the general intention of a socialized\ndiscourse; the consumer of poetry, deprived of the guide of selective\nconnections, encounters the Word frontally, and receives it as an abso-\nlute quantity, accompanied by all its possible associations. The Word,\nhere, in encyclopaedic, it contains simultaneously all the acceptations\nfrom which a relational discourse might have required it to choose. It\ntherefore achieves a state which is possible only in the dictionary or in\n\n\npoetry\u2014places where the noun can live without its article\u2014and is\nreduced to a sort of zero degree, pregnant with all past and future\nspecifications. The word here has \u2018a generic form; it is a category.\nEach poetic word is thus an unexpected object, a Pandora rs box from which\nfly out all the potentialities of language; it is therefore produced and\nconsumed with a peculiar curiosity, a kind of sacred relish.... It\ninitiates a discourse full of gaps and full of lights, filled with\nabsences and ovemourishing signs, without foresight or stability of\nintention, and thereby so opposed to the social function of language that\nmerely to have recourse to a discontinuous speech is to open the door to\nall that stands above Nature.\n\n\nROLAND BARTHES\n\n(from Roland Barthes\u2019 essay Writing Degree Zero, which has just become\n available again in paperback in a reissue by Hill & Wang, at $2.95)\n\n"},{"uid":"TomBeckett_RobertGrenier_1980","author":"Tom Beckett","shortTitle":"Robert Grenier","title":"Tom Beckett | Robert Grenier | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn13\/pictures\/013.html","text":"\nRobert Grenier, Oakland (1980; Tuumba Press, 2639 Russell, Berkeley,\nCalifornia 94705; $2)\n\n     The houses in Oakland are sentences.

As words are put together to form sentences,\nsentences are (i.g., have been) put together to convey extended meaning \u2014\nin Watten, this process broken down (examined) by dissociating the sen-\ntences, drawing attention to the statements as they stand alone embodying\ntheir meaning \u2014 their meaning nowhere essentially contiguous with what is\noutside each of themselves. (Always within a subtly reserved partially\nenigmatic decorum of his own device.) Contempt for narrative. An attack\non (analysis of) coherent thoughts or statements to build on each other\nand form meaning, along with the intentions thereby implied. Watten is\nnot making these statements as statements of his beliefs \u2014 they are pos-\nsible beliefs only, and show themselves to be such\u2014 thereby confounding\nthe usual purpose of statements \u2014 to express opinions \u2014 and instead\npointing out how statements work, why opinions are of no real consequence.\nShowing what the statements do by themselves. The reader wrenched around\nin each statement by the force of the language\u2014directly from the struc-\nture\u2014not the thoughts, ideas, viewpoints expressed therein and made\nalmost irrelevant to the work. But not entirely irrelevant. Since there\nis a studied intelligence operating in the selection of the statements.\nAlmost all contain coherent meaning, if slight surrealistic tinges at\ntimes. They do lead the reader to think about their content. But this\ncan\u2019t be why they are the way they are. Because they sabotage their own\nreferential content by disconnecting it, by making it indigenously inde-\ncipherable.\n\n     This identifies an important problem for writing: meaning, and the\nlack of meaning, and what (how) meaning means. There seem to be two\nlevels to this problem: (1) How language conveys meaning, and (2) How\nmeaningful (significant, important) can that meaning be. See these words\nbe words. We are now seen to be dealing with the problems of language\nfrom so deeply enmeshed in language, that it begins to sound tautological\nand inane. But it isn\u2019t. It would certainly be pleasant to see someone\nconfront in their work both these two levels of the problem at once and\ntie them together, rather than either ignorantly leaping in the supposed\ndirection of the meaning with no concern for the only way one can arrive\nthere\u2014through language\u2014as most poets have done; or alternatively,\nconcentrating on the intricacies of how language works to the exclusion\nof any further examination of the ramifications of meaning and its import\nto our lives in the broadest sense of it being able to invest them with\nthat meaning.\n\n     Watten is definitely working on how language conveys meaning. The\nnuggets he presents also promote an outside content, but it is given a\nback seat, the structure becoming the work. After Plasma and Paralleles,\n\n\n\"X\" further destroys statements by taking them apart and leaving only the\npieces of statements. Holding enough weight and inertia in themselves as\nfragments to become words in positions already outlined in advance by the\nstructure of the language. Bereft of context. Thereby disturbing, dis-\nappointing, unpleasant while insightful. (Watch Watten look into his own\nwriting.) The words pointing to themselves\u2014objects, things, tend to\nbecome the focus of our attention\u2014the words as objects sticking out to\nthe point of starkness. Also, peripherally, there are glimpses of a\nworried dream, even a conflicted personality embedded in the work. This\ncan\u2019t be written off as unreal, nor taken as Watten himself showing\nthrough the work.

These passages are fragments out of synch or traditionally\nlinear context with one another. Their origins are ambiguous; some appear flagrantly stolen from\nothers' work, some plainly autobiographical, but in any case they turn resolutely from any such\ngenesis and face forward towards the reader as though oblivious to any context beyond their own\nconfessions of identity. A novel is a collage of such verbal overlays in conscious contiguity.\n\nThe figures explain themselves, enunciate their themes in selections from what must be virtually\nendless snakelike mental sets, to no evident purpose or effect in mundane, lugubrious particularity of\nvocal gest. When insights occur in the work, they do no more than that and pass with the flush of\npsychic event, scarcely resonating, neither delaying nor transforming the indulgent evacuation of self-\nconsciousness. Names, identities, issues, emotions, everything evident is fronted compulsively. The\nlistener editing for the authentic, the clich\u00e9d, the hyped-up, the suggestive ellipsis, the key words, the\nsensitive implication, is driven back by the landslide of heavy matter.\n\nObvious, heavy-handedly forced on our attention, evidently commodified in their melodramatic\nurgency and timely references, Kathy Acker's signifiers are weights being whirled \u2014 not constituents\nof a measured world \u2014 out there. The compulsive explanations of motivation, the churning\ninsistence of rhythms, the banal accessibility of all the proceedings disorient \u2014 there's no eventual\nnecessary thing to do with them. They are not empathic, though they would seem to mean to be.\nThey depend too steadfastly on their alienation in order to maintain the need to speak for a stranger\n(the reader), incapable of interrupting them, to reach behind their passive-aggressive emblematics.\n\nThe work is consequently offensive, inherently and intentionally. Rather than inviting imaginative\nimplication with ambiguities and difference, the voices vigorously, baldly put every nuance forth in\nthe declarative. Each relationship seems so frankly subject-object, one-on-one with one of these\ndiscounted, there are no interstices for the reader to inhabit: there's just a speaker and a void of\nmaterial, historical things, junctions, ideas, cluttered, empty and blas\u00e9. The listener or reader may be\nknocked off balance at first by sensational, anti-intellectual attitudes struck in the writing, before\nrecognizing the sensual, literary, anti-academic realism underlying its attack. The presence of the texts\npacks a wallop of disconcerting punches; its disregard for the convention of delineating subtle,\n\n\naccurate representations of truth stands behind the verbose, demanding voices that command no\nvalidity aside from that of text. Rimbaud's 'I is an other' extends to the work itself: this writing, this\nmaterial, faces off against the acknowledged written world, plainly offspring of that world's\nexperiences (its chromosomes everywhere indicate the parentage of literature) but resistant to\nintegrity within its patriarchal orders, the tradition of narrative, that caravan encamped at a mirage.\nInevitably such work offends. Through the guise of the common, the predictable, the grossly\nmanipulative, Acker strikes against accepted values, by the transparency of her strategies, her\ndisregard for taste, unities of form, motive, effect \u2014 a given character serially adopts quite various\nvoices, behavior-patterns, values, fates, making a travesty of the integrity of the individual and of\nsocial responsibility, their very internal disjointedness (or a logic as obscure and plain as that of\ndreams) radically questioning the possibility of autonomy. To engage art so against the grain one\nneeds to come to terms with one's hostility to it, as well as one's appetite towards its promises. Acker\nexposes the glamour in narrative fiction as ruthlessly as any novelist has ever written. From such an\nangle, the realization is rigorous, deeply controlled, virtually pure.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe sometimes garish and sensational genre-literature that Kathy Acker manipulates in her fiction \u2014\nthe pornographic, the violent, the fantastically autobiographical \u2014 and its insistence on emotional\nstates of helplessness, fascination, obsessive desire, masochism, rebelliousness, quasi-near-madness \u2014\nthese seem determined to press buttons, demanding either acceptance and empathy or rejection and\ncriticism. But I would argue that the overkill deadens; hyperbole reduces its matter to mannerism.\nThe verisimilitude of the situation is cast into doubt, the conventions of a given mode aren't held to\nreasonably, alternative renderings interrupt each other and encourage a sense of the arbitrary or\nmomentarily impulsive, neither characters nor narration is artistically colored with ambiguity and\ninsight enough to seduce a ready imagination. Often the narration thunders with hooks clamoring\nfor willful identification, and yet the hooks all strike me pointed the wrong way, so I just feel the cold\ncurve of steel pressed against my side and see the point over there, uselessly faced nowhere. I am\nremarkably present and implicated in this displacement of affect \u2014 hey, why am I feeling nothing?\n\u2014 or just the surface texture of a violent emotion?? I share the writer's cold uncritical gaze on her\nmaterial, and recognizing it, and my difference from her, am thrown back on my own distance from\nthe whole affair.\n\nSo I don't think her audience\/readership succumbs to the situations emotionally \u2014 I haven't met\nanyone who felt swept up that way \u2014 but there may be something of the emotionlessness of an\nunconvincing pulp that does ironically convince one. I suspect a lot of people may dig it as kitsch, as\na kind of nihilistically campy reflection of a reductive view on reality that has a lot of currency in the\n\n\npunk worldview, and in New York \u2014 the sense we have no power over circumstances and are\nhopelessly divorced from those who do; the sense sex is inextricably connected with violence;\nconversation's as valueless as dryhumping, a futile echoing of readymade dead style and information;\nsatisfaction with art derives from recognizing in it that aspect of stylistic and informational\nreductiveness that refuses to be fooled by desire for more than its own texture, attraction, show.\nEverything's almost inherently obsolescent, so there's no cause to care to define the purpose or\nresilience of the work \u2014 a onetime effect is enough. And in this, punk nihilism is simply an obverse\nof the corporate mentality of contemporary capitalism.\n\nDefiant punks, themselves often artists in their approach to life and life-problems, appear intent on\nestablishing themselves as a lumpenproletariat against the bourgeoisie, in large part their background;\nKathy shares their ambivalence between an enraged class warfare on the one hand (a romantic legacy\nof more issue-oriented movements?) and socking in for the hard times ahead (a return of our parents'\nrepressed, the Depression). Her novels are vengefully individualistic, flaunting the rights of the\nprivate.\n\nAs she becomes more interested in playful and textural qualities in her work, she steps still more\ndeeply in, intrigued with making her peace with it. Her values seem to be becoming more domestic,\nstabilizing, professional. As an upstart entrepreneur growing out of punk, she depends on tastes it's\ngenerated to make a living from her work.\n\nThe genres and languages, the texts and personal experiences she draws on are fixed in the past,\nknown, done, and preserved through mundane and typical usages. Their articulation addresses us\nwith a futility, a purposeless finality, and if these are the terms for ego and identity, no wonder she\nwould want to exorcise value from those depositories of life-significance. Rather than engaging or\ndeveloping new terms with which to mobilize a sense of human values to supplant conventional and\ndepressed ones, she marshals these patently defunct ones as though to hammer out a proof of the\nabsence of knowledge, creation, personal power available to recognition \u2014 leaving one to suppose\nthat if such things exist, they must be somewhere else, maybe illusory inasmuch as one aims to grasp\nthem or function in terms of any leverage their identification may grant us on conditions.\n\nThe characters in her fiction are definitely limited; the author is clearly free to alter them at will. The\ndead weight of mundane banal discharge and the blocking disposition of contingencies of all kinds as\nthe modi operandi of life as represented are qualified only by the artifice's ability to wantonly shift on\nany parameter. In a universe of fixed conditions, the narrative exercises freedom by contradictorily\nrecognizing all as fragmentary, interchangeable, flux, through which it makes a way by erratic crawls\n\n\nand jumps. The life of the writer's somewhere outside it, in a one-to-one relationship with the\nwriting, in no stable relationship whatever with the figures within.\n\nThe work is certainly as serious and internally motivated as it is opportunistic and socially appealing\n\u2014 it derives its cues and value more from the former but the fact that it makes its reputation and\nstatus as commodity largely by benefit of the latter make them crucial concerns. When the writing is\nthe life, the social relations that the work agrees to or engenders are particularly accountable and\ncompelling. Choice of content or areas of reference doubtless inform this, but the writing is how the\nlife makes itself social, formal, evident and influential. If an investigation into the politics of literature\n(as the body writing and reading) has possibly begun, Acker's work undertakes a brave and\nchallenging contribution to it, as well as an extremely striking one.\n\n\u2022\n\nClearly, she writes not to represent a life or world she has lived or wants to see lived but to embody\nsome sense of a dynamic condition that needs living at the period of composition. Writing is a\nlanguage alternative to the rest of acting in the world. Its relationship to that is sometimes adversary,\nsometimes passionately reverent, often smugly, arrogantly blas\u00e9, usually coldly reckoning on the\nbalance required for its hegemony and survival \u2014 the writing is, after all, a parasite.\n\nThe writer's intense, well-nigh complete investment in her writing does not realize its identity with\nthe rest of her life, by this conception, but eclipses that identity, the writer becoming wholly\nidentified with the work. (This is arguably a radical, surrealist conception, arguably an absolutist\ncommitment to literary fiction per se.) In fact Acker traces a decomposition of identity through her\nacts of novelization, to a point where she now feels fairly free of its presumptions on her\ncircumstance. Hence, voicing the text in a reading is like putting on again a cast-off weight of\nidentity which she no longer feels a compulsion either to assume or to work off. To the degree that\nthe writing act has been truly accomplished, the public work is quite surely fictive, in that not only\nare the acts it represents not empirically verifiable (Indeed, Acker's work is intentionally counter to\nverisimilitude [She says, \u2018What\u2019s okay is when it's so unbelievable you couldn't imagine anybody\ndealing with it.\u2019], a key indicator of her disinterest in representationalism as a grounding to her drift.\nParody and the grotesque are frequent means to this disorientation of the realistic interpretation, as\nare disjunctions of time, situation, identity \u2014 literature and the commonly-known world are\nmaterial not in the writing but of the writing's perceptions.), but also the vital activity that the\nwriting embodies (the need and the execution) is no longer present, but merely evoked. Her\nprohibition against revisions of any sort in her serial novels testifies to this commitment to the record\nof the writing act as primary; she is not trying to represent something else.\n\n\nThe impulse to eradicate, annihilate, distort, pervert, fundamentally disturb identity is a recurrent\ntheme in her work and in her commentary on it. I suspect this is why a lot of the masochism \u2014 built\nup not just as an imaged process but also as a series of empathetic, melodramatic hooks \u2014 comes in.\nSensitive as her early books are to the sense of a process of realization (In Williams' sense of 'the\nembodiment of knowledge,' the work seems to live out the identities and transitory traumatic states\nthe author was interested in.), the imposition of determined fictional identities on the figures of her\nwriting must strike her as the function of a sadomasochistic relationship she has a definite hand in, as\nmaster. Doubtless she nonetheless empathizes with even as she manipulates the roles of her slaves \u2014\nthese ciphers she arranges about the page in the images of fatally suffering and conflicted identities.\nThe accessible legibility and blatant dramatic force of her approach, which are coldly and sometimes\nbrutally fronted in her work (such that their being so insistently pushed forward seems ever more\nremarkable than style and content, often tacky and mundane, are themselves), are the chains and\nracks themselves to hold flatly in place the variously strained and relaxed forms of identity lent the\nwork by either writer or reader. Then, how much can s\/he take before s\/he goes over the edge? and,\nwhat edge? and, is there any edge? or, is there merely legibility, and letting the reader let the book go,\nwhatever the end of reading? The pictured images, the voiced ideologies, the infought conflicts, are\nthe variously displayed and exercised instruments of this lascivious, largely fantasied torture.\n\nSuch a characterization might apply to most any writing. Acker doesn't half-deconstruct the\napparatus a la Huysmanns, Lautreamont, Gide or Robbe-Grillet, with their ironic and significant\nrelish for relationship with reader and the figures in the fictions. Her work doesn't aim to provide a\nreconciliation to her conflict over identity, significance and relationship so much as recognize the\nconflict and push it, to the breaking point, or out the window, or till she trips over it and beyond, if\nnecessary \u2014 so she doesn't care what use the reader has or it, so long as it escalates the conditions that\nare most centrally problematic for her in the writing project. Such characterization can't account for\nthe fact that her writing has changed since then. If the Image of the Self might be said to be the\nantagonist of her project and whatever can be pitted against it her multifarious protagonist, then her\nallowance of so much of the field of articulation to confession, explanation and other self-referential\nhistrionics on the part of her central figures belies the absoluteness of her campaign against the\nImage's primacy: it seems to be the establishment of stacity and status in the Image that antagonizes:\nThe novels work Singleness through one thing after another, restlessly refusing to let it\nstop, even at nothing ...\n"},{"uid":"SteveBenson_KetjakinSanFrancisco_1979","author":"Steve Benson","shortTitle":"Ketjak in San Francisco","title":"Steve Benson | Ketjak in San Francisco | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn8\/pictures\/022.html","text":"\nKETJAK IN SAN FRANCISCO\n\n\n     'This vs the zone.

The reading was\ninsistent emphatic and lively with an energy intoxicated by its own\nvigor and exactitude; it was chatty (unusual for Ron\u2019s reading) in its\nthrilled, maybe sometimes even giddy playfulness with the rhetoric of\nits phrases in all their possible relevancy to this heterogeneous, very\nlive occasion. He was clearly reading the reading of his poem and\nusing this to illuminate as if from behind (and taking pleasure in the\nillusion as though from within) the poem itself. The recurrences\nvariousness & personality of the text discoursed directly and one-on-\none, as in a most democratic and definitive garden party of the urban\nstreets, with the prolifery of the situation....

A\nman walked up, slowing down towards the poet, and then passed to his\nright, as though uncertain only whether Ron meant to be an obstacle but\nconfident in any case that he should negotiate a passage. A woman with\na friend turned around abruptly after passing the poet when she heard\n\"She loves to give head\"; shocked, she tried to make out whether he\u2019d\nbeen exposing her or somebody else; others say she smiled in recognition.\nA drunk tried to mimic Ron\u2019s phrases into catchy blues. Ron read as\nthough too busy to acknowledge all this formally but cognitive of it in\nall its valences of continguity and implication (or you may say fact &\nwhat might happen next). You could stand or sit anywhere.

I am absolutely\nsuspicious of those who claim a political righteousness at the expense\nof others.

The \u2019social\ncontract\u2019 is not some kind of binding obligation, obviously. I am\nbasically puzzled at the need anyone feels to point at their role as\npolitically correct or to colleagues\u2019 as politically incorrect, since\nit seems that political change comes not from the recognition of cate-\ngories but from a revelation of the nature of the functions of social\nexperience as they effect one\u2019s life inextricably from effect in\nothers\u2019\u2014a revelation that takes place through social relations, usually\nI guess through work.

The\nlines, stanzas, poems, sentences are as relentlessly and casually\nformal in their occupation as any. Here it seems second nature, vir-\ntually de rerum natura \/ the way things are \u2014\n\n    These are voices in the mind that are no less for that in the body.\nTheir tone and import take from all the gestures of moment that happen\nin the inward-looking roving mind the gist of their curb (\u2019\u2019this pleas-\nant, slightly confused murmuring\u201d), BW gets a positive rush of\ncourage out of sinking feelings, while the whole turmoil comes across\nin the blankest verse, direct as it is erring, voluble as it is\nlaconic, glib as it is searching.\n\n    Wave is a long poem of some more than 13 pages, dedicated to Diane\nWard, much of it virtually prose and the whole more loosely structured\nthan other BW work I\u2019ve seen. Its sections are discrete but not\nnumbered and there is no interruption. The tone is of a voice deliber-\nately talking on, such that no distinction need be made between figura-\ntive and literal speech. The conversation is as literary as in Conrad,\nand there is no joke about talk.\n\n    Part of the project of Wave appears to be to say something given\n\n\nthat it is difficult. The difficulties are various, and named when\npossible\u2014 \"You have nothing to talk about, \/ and no way to say it\";\n\"The words fly off into the air, \/ one by one, slowly, like \/ thought\nballoons, escaping analysis\/ into their immediate constituent units\";\n\"You will say the same thing over and over again, but in different\nways.\" There is no difference between puzzling over and celebrating\nhere. The poem has the air of a disquisition on being here, or is it\nrelationship, or address, but leans not on prepared terms, strategies,\nsyntaxes, known ideas, but hurdles them. It is of and in movement,\nwith a consciously rhetorical resistance against though amid the kind\nof stasis bred of getting anything down\u2014 \"the matter\/ becoming an\nend in itself, \/ the individual waves \/ obscuring the sea, \/ and then\nyou\u2019re lost: lost because you have found one place to be safer than\nothers, and it is, but what has happened \/ to the motion. Absorbed\/\ninto the lines. \/ You have to support \/ what you can\u2019t avoid, \/ and that\nbecomes automatic, so that it\u2019s as much a rule for those who use it to\nmake things easy, freeze the motion, as those who learn to ride the\nwave, though the latter course is fraught with obstacles, \u2019monsters,\u2019\neven; still, there is no reason to be proud of this because you have\nonly done what you had to.\"\n\n      Along with the unwillingness to assume or grant the rightness of\n  any given topic or form runs the assertion not only that any given\n  perception or act is adequate and inevitable but also that each is,\n  perhaps however one happens to see it, a casual paradigm. The indirec-\n  tion of the poem\u2019s investigations and the distracting imbalance of its\n  resolutions, which is egged on to generate another momentum, paradoxi-\n  cally challenge and confirm this almost matter-of-fact fatality\u2014 the\n  energy offsets romantic and classical attitudes, which are both felt\n  deeply and problematically. Evidently the poem was written with 2\n  hands. Reading it, dialectical faculties are called into debate and\n  deconstructed. The poem is heartfelt, with that innate music, enough\n  that the consequence is a sort of dance, albeit tentative and ceremoni-\n  ous like two contemporary friends meeting on purpose together who don\u2019t\n  know each other yet\u2014 Although you might say there is nothing to\n  fear, casualness, generosity, even a show of vulnerability seem requi-\n  site as much to indicate one\u2019s autonomy and separateness as to elicit\n  sympathy and response. The poem is less incantatory of the image of\n  such discourse than of its issue in what one may take it that it needs\n  to be, as though the voices barraging one from inside the head might\n  be recognized as just as worthy of trust as the whisper in one\u2019s ear\n  from an ideal friend, as though the focused deflection of all aural\n  experience through the conch shell were actually the ocean\u2019s chosen\n  form of address to me, whether arbitrary indeed or reiterative or\n  intended for this moment all along. I myself find this rather upset-\n  ting. BW persistently raises the stakes of the poem high as possible\n\n\nwithout losing them from our mutual view, challenges ideals of action,\nperception, and utterance and what can be said of them, however\nironically, sparing no direct reference to the weaknesses noticed in\ncoping with them.\n\n\nSTEVE BENSON\n"},{"uid":"BillBerkson_Greenwald_1979","author":"Bill Berkson","shortTitle":"Greenwald","title":"Bill Berkson | Greenwald | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/004.html","text":"\n            GREENWALD\n\n            IN TED GREENWALD\n\n\n\"Actual events are obscure\n\n                                  Though the observers appear clear\"\n                                  Edwin Denby\n\nObjects stand in rooms lit by sunlight which, penetrates those rooms from\nfront to back.

Her work, then, consists of\ntaking the dictation of these seen ciphers\u2014she calls them voices\u2014and\nweaving them into a text.\n\nTo \u2019\u2019see words\u201d is to be inside language and looking out onto it. For\nWeiner, this has involved an actual seeing (clairvoyance), although at the\nlevel of the text it is present as a pervasive citationality (both in the\nsense of a sighting and a quoting).\n\nAnd yet, because Weiner\u2019s work is so rooted in the momentum of the act of\nwriting,* the diaristic energy manages to totally submerge (immerse) the\ncitational shards into its flow. She has herself said that she is interes-\nted in an electric energy that completely fills the page, transforming it\ninto an impermeable field. It is this element that manages to fuse the\neruptive fragments (\"voices\u201d) into a completely uninterrupted continuity.\nSo that the three voice simultaneity that makes up her text reads out as\na linear syntax, while proposing a complete awareness of its paratactic\nmethod, its shard-like materials. Yet, finally, these different voices\nset up a syntax that is not linear or monologic (the continuous strip of\nthe prose line) nor do they simply establish a discourse that is dialogic\nor reflective. Here, the mind is constantly interrupting\u2014intruding upon,\ncommenting on\u2014its own processes with its caps THIS GIVES ME ORDERS and\nits italics don't make so many generalizations stupid silly. (\u201dHow can I\ndescribe anything when all these interruptions keep arriving and then tell\nme I didn\u2019t describe it well WELL\u201d) But, more than this, the text makes\none piece of (with) all this activity, continuously integrating \u2019\u2019outside\u2019\u2019**\nelements into its compositional field without compromising their vertical\ndisruption of the uniplanar surface. (\u2019\u2019Each page a state of consciousness.\u201d)\n\nThe sections of her Journal that Weiner has chosen to publish in the forth-\ncoming Angel Hair edition are characterized, even more apparently than\n\n\nsome previously published sections of the work, by a recurrence of the\nmost commonplace mental static that is as much an example of obsessiveness\nas a method of release from it. I can\u2019t think of a book which has more\ninsistently faced these materials\u2014\"BIG OK SIT STILL RHYS COMES\nPREGO INstructions this morning: BATH, SIT FOR AN HOUR bathrobe\nA LOT OF RHYS thinking of going to Jerry\u2019s reading it\u2019s at 2 saw 2\nOCLOCK Still depressed, dreamt I was being married off to some fat\nJewish boy I had to wear this shower cap be careful tonight donTt dream.\nPUT SOME CLOTHES ON Is that Peggy, the same as GET DRESS There\u2019s a\nlot of energy in this 30's robe can see parts of me light up glowing\u00b9\u00b9\u2014\nnor one that has looked out on this world with a more pervasively whimsical\nrefusal to take oneself\u2014& these facts of life\u2014too seriously. That this\nbook is largely composed of debris may account for some of the anxiety in\nreading it.\n\nIn her work, Weiner has explored\u2014come upon\u2014the language that fills, and\noften enough, controls our lives (every day, common place: she says \"group\nmind\"). That these elements are seen in the work, hence physicalized,\npalpable, gives us a view of what is given, what has been handed down: &\nby seeing the language operate, we can start to free ourselves from a\ncompulsive obedience to it. The citational: shards of language, ciphers\nto be examined for evidence, yet which we are forever beholden to...\nwhich holds our sight within its views, The purpose of writing, Weiner\nsays, is to \"change consciousness\u201d, \u2014This work is, for me, heroic\nbecause of its radical reaffirmation of a commitment to writing as a\nspecific kind of activity rather than as a specific kind of object making,\nan investigation rather than an aestheticization.\n\nWeiner\u2019s writing is a chronicle of a mind coming to terms with itself,\nquite literally: for the terms are, in fact, made visible. We all see\nwords, but it is our usual practice to see through them. Weiner has\nfocussed her gaze not through, not beyond, but onto.\n\n\n\n\n* Weiner\u2019s work stands as a rather remarkable extension of the diaristic\ntradition in literature. The sense of writing out a life, the enormous\nforce that words have to come of their own, is graphically portrayed in\nTruffaut\u2019s Diary of Adele where the writing is more overpowering than\nanything else, but also where it is never reflected on. Bresson, in Diary\nof a Country Priest, also focusses on the keeping of a journal, here the\npaper absorbing the ink of each word penned as if it were life soaking up\nso much blood.\n\n\n** \"The poetry...begins...when the composing factor\u2014the dictation, the\nunknown, the outside\u2014enters the work and...begins to construct a poetry\n\n\nthat was not lyric but narrative...

You\n     can stretch them, deform them and even break them apart, and\n     they still have an inner cohesion that keeps them together. \"\n\nNot \u2019death\u2019 of the referent\u2014rather a recharged use of the multivalent\nreferential vectors that any word has, how words in combination tone and\nmodify the associations made for each of them, how \u2019reference\u2019 then is not\na one-on-one relation to an \u2019object\u2019 but a perceptual dimension that\ncloses in to pinpoint, nail down (\"this\" word), sputters omnitropically\n(the in in the which of who where what wells), refuses the build up of\nimage track\/projection while, pointillistically, fixing a reference at\neach turn (fills vats ago lodges spire), or, that much rarer case (Peter\nInman\u2019s Platin and David Melnick\u2019s Pcoet two recent examples) of \"zaum\"\n\n\n(so called \"transnational\", pervasively neologistic) \u2014\"ig ok aber-\nflappi\" \u2014 in which reference, deprived of its automatic reflex reaction\nof word\/stimulus image\/response roams over the range of associations\nsuggested by the word, word shooting off referential vectors like the\nenergy field in a Kirillian photograph.\n\nAll of which are ways of releasing the energy inherent in the referential\ndimension of language, that these dimensions are the material of which the\nwriting is made, define its medium. Making the structures of meaning in\nlanguage more tangible and in that way allowing for the maximum resonance\nfor the medium \u2014 the traditional power that writing has always had to\nmake experience palpable not by simply pointing to it but by (re)creating\nits conditions. **\n\nPoint then, at first instance, to see the medium of writing\u2014our area of\noperation\u2014as maximally open in vocabulary, forms, shapes, phoneme\/\nmorpheme\/word\/phrase\/sentence order, etc., so that possible areas covered,\nranges of things depicted, suggested, critiqued, considered, etc., have an\nouter limit (asymptotic) of what can be thought, what can (might) be.\nBut then, taking that as zero degree, not to gesturalize the possibility\nof poetry to operate in this \"hyperspace\", but to create works (poems)\nwithin it.\n*\n\nThe order of the words, the syntax, creates possibilities for images,\npictures, representations, descriptions, invocation, ideation, critique,\nrelation, projection, etc. Sentences that follow standard grammatical\npatterns allow the accumulating references to enthrall the reader by\ndiminishing diversions from a constructed representation. In this way,\neach word\u2019s references work in harmony by reinforcing a spatio\/temporal\norder conventionalized by the bulk of writing practice that creates the\n\"standard\". \"The lamp sits atop the table in the study\" \u2014 each word\nnarrowing down the possibilities of each other, limiting the interpreta-\ntion of each word\u2019s meaning by creating an ever more specific context.\nIn a similar way, associations with sentences are narrowed down by conven-\ntional expository or narrational paragraph structure, which directs atten-\ntion away from the sentence as meaning generating event and onto the\n\"content\" depicted. By shifting the contexts in which even a fairly\n\"standard\" sentence finds itself, as in the prose format work of Ron\nSilliman and Barrett Watten, the seriality of the ordering of sentences\nwithin a paragraph displaces from its habitual surrounding the projected\nrepresentational fixation that the sentence conveys. \"Words elect us. The\nlamp sits atop the table in the study. The tower is burnt orange....\"\nBy rotating sentences within a paragraph (a process analogous to jump\ncutting in film) according to principles generated by and unfolding in\nthe work (rather than in accordance with representational construction\npatterns) a perceptual vividness is intensified for each sentence since\n\n\nthe abruptness of the cuts induces a greater desire to savor the tangi-\nbility of each sentence before it is lost to the next, determinately other,\nsentence. Juxtapositions not only suggest unsuspected relations but in-\nduce reading along ectoskeletal and citational lines. As a result, the\noperant mechanisms of meaning are multiplied and patterns of projection in\nreading are less restricted. The patterns of projection are not, however,\nundetermined. The text operates at a level that not only provokes projec-\ntions by each sentence but by the sequencing of the sentences suggests\nlines or paths for them to proceed along. At the same time, circumspec-\ntion about the nature and meaning of the projections is called forth.\n\nThe result is both a self-reflectiveness and an intensification of the\nitems\/conventions of the social world projected\/suggested\/provoked. A\nsimilar process can also take place within sentences and phrases and not\nonly intersententially. Syntactic patterns are composed which allow for\nthis combination of projection and reflection in the movement from word to\nword. \"For as much as, within the because, tools their annoyance, tip to\ntoward.\" \u2014But, again, to acknowledge this as the space of the text, and\nstill to leave open what is to be said, what projections desire these\nreflections.\n\n        *\n\nThe sense of music in poetry: the music of meaning\u2014emerging, fogging,\nconstrasting, etc. Tune attunement in understanding\u2014the meaning sounds.\nIt\u2019s impossible to separate prosody from the structure (the form and con-\ntent seen as an interlocking figure) of a given poem. You can talk about\nstrategies of meaning generation, shape, the kinds of sounds accented, the\nvarieties of measurement (of scale, of number, of line length, of syllable\norder, of word length, of phrase length, or measure as punctuation, of\npunctuation as metrics) . But no one has primacy \u2014the music is the orches-\ntrating these into the poem, the angles one plays against another, the\nshading. In much of my own work: working at angles to the strong tidal\npull of an expected sequence of a sentence \u2014 or by cutting off a sentence\nor phrase midway and counting on the mind to complete where the poem goes\noff in another direction, giving two vectors at once \u2014 the anticipated\nprojection underneath and the actual wording above.\n\nMy interest in not conceptualizing the field of the poem as a unitary\nplane, and so also not using overall structural programs: that any\nprior \"principle\" of composition violates the priority I want to give to\nthe inherence of surface, to the total necessity in the durational space\nof the poem for every moment to count. The moment not subsumed into a\nschematic structure, hence instance of it, but at every juncture creating\n(synthesizing) the structure. So not to have the work resolve at the\nlevel of the \"field\" if this is to mean a uniplanar surface within which\nthe poem operates. Structure that can\u2019t be separated from decisions made\nwithin it, constantly poking through the expected parameters. Rather\n\n\nthan having a single form or shape or idea of the work pop out as you read,\nthe structure itself is pulled into a moebius-like twisting momentum. In\nthis process, the language takes on a centrifugal force that seems to trip\nit out of the poem, turn it out from itself, exteriorizing it. Textures,\nvocabularies, discourses, constructivist modes of radically different\ncharacter are not integrated into a field as part of a predetermined\nplanar architecture; the gaps and jumps compose a space within shifting\nparameters, types and styles of discourse constantly criss-crossing, inter-\nacting, creating new gels. (Intertextual, interstructural....) (Bruce\nAndrews has suggested the image of a relief map for the varying kinds of\nreferential vectors \u2014 reference to different domains of discourse, refer-\nences made by different processes \u2014 in some of his work in which words\nand phrases are visually spaced out over the surface of the page. How-\never, the structural dissonance in these works is counterbalanced by the\nperspicacious poise of the overall design, which tends to even out the\nsurface tension.)\n\n\nWriting as a process of pushing whatever way, or making the piece cohere\nas far as can: stretching my mind\u2014to where I know it makes sense but\nnot quite why\u2014suspecting relations that I understand, that make the sense\nof the ready-to-hand \u2014 ie pushing the composition to the very limits of\nsense, meaning, to that razor\u2019s edge where judgment\/aesthetic sense is all\nI can go on (knowhow). (Maybe what\u2019s to get beyond in Olson\u2019s field\ntheory is just the idea of form as a single web, a unified field, one\nmatrix, with its implicit idea of \"perception\" onto a given world rather\nthan, as well, onto the language through which the world is constituted.)\nSo that the form, the structure, that, finally, is the poem, has emerged,\nis come upon, is made.\n\n\n\n**Alan Davies has objected that language and experience are separate realms\nand that the separation should be maximized in writing, in this way ques-\ntioning the value of using language to make experience palpable. \u2014But I\ndon\u2019t mean \"experience\" in the sense of a picture\/image\/representation\nthat is calling back to an already constituted experience. Rather, lan-\nguage itself constitutes experience at every moment (in reading and other-\nwise). Experience, then, is not tied into representation exclusively\nbut is a separate \"perception\"-like category. (& perception not neces-\nsarily as in perception onto a physical\/preconstituted world, as \"eyes\" in\nthe Olson sense, that is not just onto a matrix-qua-the world but as opera-\nting\/projecting\/composing activity.) The point is, then, that experience\nis a dimension necessarily built into language \u2014 that far from being avoid-\nable, or a choice, it is a property. So this view attempts to rethink\nrepresentational or pictorial or behaviorist notions of what \"experience\"\nis, i.e., experience is not inextricably linked to representation, norma-\ntive syntax, images, but rather, the other way around, is a synthetic,\n\n\ngenerative activity\u2014\"in the beginning was the word\" & so on, or that\u2019s\nour \"limit\" of beginnings.\n\n\nCHARLES BERNSTEIN\n"},{"uid":"CharlesBernstein_StrayStrawsandStrawMen_1980","author":"Charles Bernstein","shortTitle":"Stray Straws and Straw Men","title":"Charles Bernstein | Stray Straws and Straw Men | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":null,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEsupp1\/pictures\/035.html","text":"\nCHARLES BERNSTEIN\n\nStray Straws and Straw Men\n\n1.\t\u2018I look straight into my heart & write the exact words that come\nfrom within. The theory of fragments whereby poetry becomes a grab\nbag of favorite items \u2014 packed neatly together with the glue of self-\nconscious & self-consciously epic composition, or, lately, homo-\ngenized into one blend by the machine of programmatic form \u2014 is a\ndiversion. The eye is not split open in such work. There are structures\n\u2014 edifices \u2014 wilder than the charts of rivers, but they are etched by\nmaking a path not designing a garden.\u2019\n\n\u2018Natural: the very word should be struck from the language.\u2019\n\n\u2018... but what the devil is the human?\u2019\n\n2.\tRon Silliman has consistently written a poetry of visible borders: a\npoetry of shape. His works are composed very explicitly under\nvarious conditions, presenting a variety of possible worlds, possible\nlanguage formations. Such poetry emphasizes its medium as being\nconstructed, rule governed, everywhere circumscribed by grammar\n& syntax, chosen vocabulary: designed, manipulated, picked, prog-\nrammed, organized, & so an artifice, artifactual, an artifact \u2014 monadic,\nsolipsistic, homemade, manufactured, mechanized & formulaic at\nsome points: willful.\n\n3.\tWork described as this may discomfort those who want a poetry\nprimarily of personal communication, flowing freely from the inside\nwith the words of a natural rhythm of life, lived daily. Perhaps the\nconviction is that poetry not be made by fitting words into a pattern\nbut by the act of actually letting it happen, writing, so that that which is\n\u2018stored within pours out\u2019 without reference to making a point any\nmore than to making a shape. The thing is not to create programmes\nto plug words into but to eliminate such imposed interferences.\n\nAn influence of work that appears to be of this (other) type is the\nsanctification of something that gets known as its honesty, its direct-\nness, its authenticity, its artlessness, its sincerity, its spontaneity, its\npersonal expressiveness; in short, its \u2018naturalness.\u2019 (As the pastoral was\nonce the natural, & likewise the romantic.)\n\nI would point to Bernadette Mayer\u2019s Memory as a work that seems\nrooted in some of these (\u2018natural\u2019) assumptions, as well as to much of\nKerouac. In a different way, & the look of the work is the measure of\nhow different, Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s poetry is relevant. The achievement of\n\nthese three poets has much to do with how they have fronted these\nassumptions.\n\n4.\tPersonal subject matter & a flowing syntax, whatever those des-\ncriptions mean to a particular writer, are the key to the natural look.\n(Though it needs to be said that the variety of writing that relics on\nsome sense of natural for its inspiration & domain is infinite.)\n\n5.\tThe sexual, for example, has much the pull of the natural. For some\nit poses as the most intimate subject matter. Others have it as the\nenergy that drives their writing, or else its source.\n\nEdward Dahlberg (sexistly) describes Word as Cock. \u2018Masculine\nfiery particles,\u2019 \u2018motions of will,\u2019 he says, animate the great writing of\nthe past. He rebukes American literature for not being grounded in the\nFlesh, describing it as stagnant, dehumanized, & frigid. \u2018Esoteric\nartificers\u2019 & \u2018abstruse technicians,\u2019 our writers \u2014 Poe, Dickinson.\nThoreau, Hawthorne, Melville & those before & after\u2014 have led a wav\nfrom \u2018the communal song of labor, sky, star, field, love.\u2019\n\n6.\tThere is also an attraction toward looking for the natural in \u2018direct\nexperience,\u2019 both in terms of recording the actual way objective reality\nis perceived (the search for the objective) & making the writing a\nrecording instrument of consciousness.\n\n\u2018This work I experience as an instance of the writer\u2019s fantasy &\nimagination & vision & not as a construction. I feel immersed in it. It\nseems seamless to me. I am carried along by it. The experience is\npresent to me. Shifts in tone, place occur as inevitable sequences:\ninevitable because they cohere, because they allow me to experience\nthem, because they seem to happen.\u2019\n\n7.\t\u2018Technical artifice' they scream, as if poetry doesn't demand a tech-\nnical precision. (\u2018That poetry is an art, an art with technique, with\nmedia, an art that must be in constant flux, a constant change of\nmanner.\u2019) Technicians of the human.\n\n8.\tA sign of the particularity of a piece of writing is that it contains\nitself, has established its own place, situates itself next to us. We move\nup close, stare in, & see a world. It has moving parts, accountable &\nunaccountable rcurrences, a particular light, a heavy dense odor. \u2018But\ncan I actually experience it?\u2019 Yes. But it reveals the conditions of its\noccurrence at the same time as it is experienced. So I don\u2019t feel a part of\nit as much as facing it.... Of course at times you forget. All of a sudden\na few hours, a week, flash by before you actually notice. & you say to\nyourself\u2018how the time slips \u2014\u2019\n\n9.\t\"Next to us the grandest laws are continually being executed.

But we are \u2018beside ourselves in a sane way\u2019\nfor what is beside us is also ourselves. At the same time in & beside. \u2014\nThe signs of language, of a piece of writing, are not artificial contruc-\ntions, mere structures, \u2018mere naming.\u2019 They do not sit, deanimated, as\nsymbols in a code, dummies for things of nature they refer to; but are,\nof themselves, of ourselves, whatever is such. \u2018Substance.\u2019 \u2018Actuality.\u2019\n\u2018Presence.\u2019 The very plane through which we front the world, by\nwhich the world is.\n\n10.\tCompare \/ these two views \/ of what \/ poetry \/ is.\n\nIn the one, an instance (a recording perhaps) of reality \/ fantasy I\nexperience \/ event is presented to us through the writing.\n\nIn the other, the writing itself is seen as an instance of reality I\nfantasy \/ experience I event.\n\n\n\n11. Another example.\n\nThe sanctification of the natural comes up in terms of \u2018voice\u2019 & has\nbeen extended by various excursions into the oral. On the one hand,\nthere is the assumption that poetry matures in the location of\u2018one\u2019s\nown voice\u2019 which as often as not is no more than a consistency of style\n& presentation. \u2018The voice of the poet\u2019 is an easy way of contex-\ntualizing poetry so that it can be more readily understood (indiscrimi-\nnately plugged into) as listening to someone talk in their distinctive\nmanner (i.e., listen for the person beyond or underneath the poem);\nbut this theatricalization does not necessarily do the individual poem\nany service & has the tendency to reduce the body of a poet\u2019s work to\nlittle more than personality. (This contrasts with that major preoccu-\npation in American poetry \u2014 the investigation of the grammar of\ntalking, of speech, both by traditional poetic technique &, lately, by\ntape transcription.) On the other hand, there is a growing use of voice\nin a variety of sound poetry. Some performance & audiotape works\nuse voice as essentially a vocabulary to be processed by techniques\nsuch as cut-up, consonant & vowel intonation, simultaneity, etc.\nOthers, searching for the \u2018natchuralness\u2019 of an oral liturgy we\u2019ve lost,\n& influenced by tribal & religious & bardic \u2014 communal \u2014 poetic\npractice, make use of vocalizations related to the human breath (e.g.,\nchanting & other assorted organic sounding tones). \u2014 Voice is a possi-\nbility for poetry not an essence.\n\n12.\tI am not making a distinction, there is no useful distinction to be\nmade here, between making the poem a subject or an object. Nor is it\nnecessary to choose up among the personal desire to communicate, tell\nwhat has been seen, share a way of seeing, transmit some insight,\nirony, or simply give a feeling for texture.\n\nWhat I want to call attention to is that there is no natural writing\nstyle; that the preference for its supposed manifestations is simply a\npreference for a particular look to poetry & often a particular\nvocabulary (usually perceived as personal themes); that this preference\n(essentially a procedural decision to work within a certain domain\nsanctified into a rite of poetry) actually obscures the understanding of\nthe work which appears to be its honoured bases; & especially that the\ncant of\u2018make it personal\u2019 & \u2018let it flow\u2019 are avoidances \u2014 by mystifica-\ntion \u2014 of some very compelling problems that swirl around truth-\ntelling, confession, bad faith, false self, authenticity, virtue, etc.\n\n13.\tThe considerable achievement of Frank O\u2019Hara is to have a form\nof poetry largely within the domain of the personal. Note, however,\nthat O\u2019Hara\u2019s word \u2018personism\u2019 is not \u2018personalism\u2019; it acknowledges\nthe work to be a fronting of another person \u2014 another mind, if you will,\nas much as another nature. O\u2019Hara\u2019s work proposes a domain of the\npersonal, & not simply assuming it, fully works it out. His remarkable\nuse of voice, for example, allows, through a musing whimsy in that\nvoice, for fantasy as wild as any surrealist imagines, contained, still,\nwithin his proposd boundaries.\n\n14.\tThere is no automatic writing. It is a claim that has had to be made\nto the detractors of modernism again & again (an early article by B.F.\nSkinner attacked \u2018Stein\u2019s little secret\u2019) & must now be made another\ntime to avoid accepting as a value an analysis generated out of misun-\nderstanding & animosity.\n\nNot that the followers of the natural, or the organic, or the personal,\nwould necessarily have work that looks automatic. But it seems to me\nthat this is at the heart of the strongest claim to natural spontaneous\nwriting \u2014 the impulse to record or transcribe the movements &\nmake-up of one\u2019s consciousness. The modernist assumption. What\u2019s\nto note is that in practice, project! vely, that impulse transposes itself to\nsomething like a search for a method of\u2018syntaticalizing conscousness\u2019,\ni.e., ordering one\u2019s consciousness into language; as if consciousness\nexisted prior to \u2014 aside from \u2014 language & had to be \u2018put into\u2019 it; as if\nconsciousness were not itself a syntacticalization \u2014 a syntaxophony.\n\nEvery phrase I write, every juxtaposition I make, is a manifestation\nof using a full-blown language: full of possibilities of meaning &\nimpossibilities of meaning. It can\u2019t be avoided. Whatever comes out\n\ncomes out on account of a variety of psychological dispositions, per-\nsonal experiences, & literary preoccupations & preconceptions. The\nbest of the writing that gets called automatic issues from a series of\nchoices as deliberate & reflected as can be.\n\n15.\tWhatever gets written gets written in a particular shape, uses a\nparticular vocabulary & syntax, & a variety of chosen techniques.\nWhether its shape, syntax & vocabulary result from an attraction (or\nideological attachment to) the organic & spontaneous, or to some\nother look, it is equally chosen. Sometimes this process takes place\nintuitively or unconsciously (the pull of influence comes in here since\nsomewhere in the back of your mind are models for what looks\nnatural, personal, magical, mystical, spontaneous, automatic, dream-\nlike, confessional, didactic, shocking). Sometimes it is a very con-\nscious process. Any way, you\u2019re responsible for what turns up. Free\nassociation, for example, is no more inherently \u2018natural\u2019 than cutting\nup: & neither is in any sense \u2018random\u2019. One technique may be used\nbecause a decision is made to use subconscious material. Another may\nbe used to limit the vocabulary of the poem to words not self-\ngenerated. In either case, various formal decisions are made & these\ndecisions shape the work.\n\n16.\tOkay, given that,it\u2019s given, is it possible to continue under condi-\ntions set up before? Or is everything, every instance, a new decision at\neach moment? & recklessly charging forward it appears to copy some\nother thing, or be beholding, or under. What happens when the images\ncease, when there are no more images confronting the eye of imagina-\ntion & still the signs, the written traces of activity, continue to be\nproduced. Music sounds. It too must pass. A syntactical exploration of\nconsciousness becomes very explicitly the concern, so imbedded even\nin a subject matter of boundaries & possible worlds, that it ceases to be,\nor only diverts. The subject matter simply all that is inside, given\nrhythm, different cadences, the punctuation in typing of each letter as\nseparate unit, the propulsion of a comma. Is it possible, for example, to\nallow typographical errors, mistypings, to remain integral? Typing\nitself then becoming a condition. It becomes part of the temptation.\nOr perhaps it\u2019s just my fear that when I tap what I find inside myself I\nwill find that it is empty & insist that the scratchings must account for\nsomething.\n\n17.\tWriting* necessarily consists of attaching numerous bits & pieces\ntogether in a variety of ways. & it comes to a point where you feel any\ncomposition is an artifice & a deceit. & the more \u2018natchural\u2019 the look\nthe more deceptive. That any use of language outside its function of\n\ncommunicating in speaking is a falsehood (cf. Laura Riding). Or even,\nthat language itself \u2014 everywhere conditioning our way of seeing &\nmeaning\u2014is an illusion (as if there were some thing outside language!)\n\nOr take it this way: I want to just write \u2014 let it come out \u2014 get in\ntouch with some natural process \u2014 from brain to pen \u2014 with no\ninterference of typewriter, formal pattern. & it can seem like the lan-\nguage itself \u2014 having to put it into words \u2014 any kind of fixing a version\nof it \u2014 gets in the way. That I just have this thing inside me \u2014 silently \u2014\nunconditioned by the choices I need to make when I write \u2014 whether it\nbe to write it down or write on. So it is as if language itself gets in the\nway of expressing this thing, this flow, this movement of conscious-\nness.\n\nBut there are no thoughts except through language, we are ever-\nywhere seeing through it, limited to it but not by it. Its conditions\nalways interpose themselves: a particular set of words to choose from\n(a vocabulary), a way of processing those words (syntax, grammar):\nthe natural conditions of language.

The distortion is to imagine that knowledge has an \"object\" outside\nof the language of which it is a part\u2014that words refer to \"transcen-\ndental signifieds\" rather than being part of a language which itself\nproduces meaning in terms of its grammar, its conventions, its \"agree-\nments in judgement\". Learning a language is not learning the names of\nthings outside language, as if it were simply a matter of matching up\n\"signifiers with signifieds\", as if signifieds already existed and we\nwere just learning new names for them.... Rather, we are initiated by\nlanguage into a (the) world, and we see and understand the world through\nthe terms and meanings that come into play in this acculturation, a\ncoming into culture where culture is the form of a community, of a col-\nlectivity. In this sense, our conventions (grammar, codes, territori-\nalities, myths, rules, standards, criteria) are our nature: there is no\ngap between nature and culture, between fact and convention. \"This\nexplicitly,\" to quote Cavell, \"makes our agreement in judgements, our\nattunement expressed through criteria, agreement in valuing. So that\nwhat can be communicated, say a fact, depends on agreements in valuing.\"\nIn this context, to speak of absolutes is to speak outside language, to\nconstruct a grammatical fiction\u2014it is to deny the human limitations of\nknowledge (for example in the pursuit of certainty or universality).\nWittgenstein\u2019s relation of grammar to \"forms of life\" emphasizes that\n\"human convention is not arbitrary but constitutive of significant speech\nand activity...(that) mutual understanding, and hence language, depends\non nothing more and nothing less than shared forms of life, call it our\nmutual attunement or agreement in our criteria\".\n\n     Cavell argues against seeing Wittgenstein as refuting skepticism\n(the belief that there can be no real knowledge of the world)\u2014all he\nrefutes is the \"transcendental illusion\". Indeed, the truth of skepti-\ncism is that there is meaning only \"inside\" our conventions, that it\nmakes no sense to speak of meaning outside these contexts. That words\nhave meaning not by virtue of universals, of underlying structures or\n\n\nrules, but in use, in\u2014to use the expression from Anti-Oedipus\u2014\ndesiring production, (\"...desire produces reality, or stated another way,\ndesiring production is one and the same as social production.\") For\nCavell, skepticism is false insofar as it invalidates the claim of\nknowledge of \"other minds\" or \"objects of the world\"; wrong, that is, to\ntake \"metaphysical finitude as a failure of knowledge\"; insofar, that is,\nas it takes certainty, or prediction and control, to be the sole basis\nfor the claim to knowledge.... For that would be to misunderstand the\nprecarious conventionality of knowledge and meaning because one imagines\nit always in terms of (knowing or not being able to know) \"things-in-\nthemselves\". If that is what knowing is then our relation to the world-\nas-a-whole is not one of knowing but being in, acting in. The limita-\ntions of knowledge are not failures of it....\n\n     For whatever similarities there may be between the Wittgenstein of\nThe Philosophical Investigations and the Jacques Derrida of Of Gramma-\ntology\u2014specifically in respect to getting rid of the idea that words\nrefer to metaphysical absolutes, to universals, to \"transcendental\nsignifieds\" rather than being part of a grammar of shared conventions, a\ngrammatology, the two seem fundamentally irreconcilable. What Derrida\nends up transforming to houses of cards\u2014shimmering traces of life insub-\nstantial as elusive\u2014Wittgenstein locates as meaning, with the full range\nof intention, responsibility, coherence, and possibility for revolt\nagainst or madness without. In Wittgenstein\u2019s accounting, one is not\nleft sealed off from the world with only \"markings\" to \"decipher\" but\nrather located in a world with meaning to respond to. Derrida ends up\nmisunderstanding the implications of his realization that experiencing\nobjects as presences does not mean they are \"transcendentally\" present\nby imagining there to be something wrong with presence itself, that it\nis illegitimate or failed. (There is something failed and the loss can\nbe felt. \"The object of faith hides itself from him. Not that he has\ngiven it up, and the hope for it; he is on the track (cp.: trace). He\nknows where it is to be found, in the true acceptance of loss, the\nrefusal of any substitute for true recovery.\" [Quote here and two below\nfrom Cavell\u2019s Senses of Walden?) The lesson of metaphysical finitude is\nnot that the world is just codes and as a result presence is to be ruled\nout as anything more than nostalgia, but that we can have presence,\ninsofar as we are able, only through a shared grammar. That our losses\nare not based on the conceptual impossibility of presence in the face of\nthe \"objects\" of presence not being \"transcendentally\" locked into place,\nbut rather on grounds that each person must take responsibility for\u2014the\nfailure to make ourselves present to each other, to respond or act when\nthe occasion demands. \"The place you may.come to may be black, something\nyou would disown; but if you have found yourself there, that is so far\nhome; you will either domesticate that, naturalize yourself there, or you\nwill recover nothing.\" For Derrida, the overthrow of human conventions\nentails no revolution, no exile\u2014it is neutralized into the axioms of a\n\n\ntextual practice, a new criticism (perhaps awaiting its Gnostic destruc-\ntion, or is it that all is maya?). One might say, against Derrida, that\ndesiring production is the \"primary signified\", if that is understood as\nproduction of a form of life, where words have truth where they have\nmeaning, in use. \"We crave only reality, but we cannot stomach it; we\ndo not believe in our lives, so we trade them in for stories; there real\nhistory is more interesting than we know.\"\n\n        CHARLES BERNSTEIN\n"},{"uid":"CharlesBernstein_TheTelling_1978","author":"Charles Bernstein","shortTitle":"The Telling","title":"Charles Bernstein | The Telling | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn2\/pictures\/012.html","text":""},{"uid":"CharlesBernstein_TheDollarValueofPoetry_1979","author":"Charles Bernstein","shortTitle":"The Dollar Value of Poetry","title":"Charles Bernstein | The Dollar Value of Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/007.html","text":"\n\nCHARLES BERNSTEIN :\n\n\nTHE DOLLAR VALUE OF POETRY\n\n     Social force is bound to be accompanied by ties, That is why all\nthat is highest in human life, every effort of thought, every effort of\nlove, has a corrosive action on the established order, Thought can\njust as readily, and on good grounds, be stigmatized as revolutionary\non the one side, as counter-revolutionary on the other, In so far as\nit is ceaselessly creating a scale of values.\u2019that is not of this world\u2019,\nit is the enemy of forces which control society,\n\n                                (Simone Weil in Oppression and Liberty.)\n\n     So writing might be exemplary'\u2014an instance broken off from and\nhence not in the service of this economic and cultural\u2014social\u2014force\ncalled capitalism.

An experience (released in the reading) which is non-commoditi-\nzed, that is where the value is not dollar value (and hence transferable\nand instrumental) but rather, what is from the point of view of the\nmarket, no value (a negativity, inaudible, invisible)\u2014that non-general-\nizable residue that is specific to each particular experience. It is\nin this sense that we speak of poetry as being untranslatable and\nunparaphrasable, for what is untranslatable is the sum of all the\nspecific conditions of the experience (place, time, order, light, mood,\nposition, to infinity) made available by reading. That the political\nvalue of poems resides in the concreteness of the experiences they make\navailable is the reason for the resistance to any form of normative\nstandardization in the ordering of words in the unit or the sequencing\nof these units, since determining the exact nature of each of these is\nwhat makes for the singularity of the text, (It is, for example, a\nmisunderstanding of the fact of untranslatability that would see certain\n\"concretist\u201d tendencies as its most radical manifestation since what is\nnot translatable is the experience released in the reading while in so\nfar as some \"visual poems\" move toward making the understanding indepen-\ndent of the language it is written in, ie no longer requiring transla-\ntion, they are, indeed, no longer so much writing as works of visual\nart.)\n\n      Certainly, one method is the restoration of memory\u2019s remembering\non its own terms, organizing along the lines of experience\u2019s trace, a\nreconstruction released from the pressures of uniform exposition\u2014\"the\nonly true moments\" the ones we have lost, which, in returning to them,\ncome to life in a way that now reveals what they had previously\nconcealed\u2014the social forces that gave shape to them. So what were\nthe unseen operators now are manifest as traces of the psychic blows\nstruck by the social forces (re)pressing us into shape (ie: \"a sigh is\nthe sword of an angel king\"). \"What we do is to bring our words back\u00b9\u00b9\n\u2014to make our experiences visible, or again: to see the conditions of\nexperience. So that, in this way, a work may also be constructed\u2014an\n\"other\" world made from whatever materials are ready to hand (not\njust those of memory)\u2014structuring, in this way, possibilities other-\nwise not allowed for.\n\n      Meanwhile, the social forces hold sway in all the rules for the\n\"clear\" and \"orderly\" functioning of language and Caesar himself is\nthe patron of our grammar books. Experience dutifully translated into\nthese \"most accessible\" codes loses its aura and is reduced to the\ndigestible contents which these rules alone can generate. There is\nnothing difficult in the products of such activity because there is no\ndistance to be travelled, no gap to be aware of and to bridge from\nreader to text: what purports to be an experience is transformed into\n\n\nthe blank stare of the commodity\u2014there only to mirror our projections\nwith an unseemly rapidity possible only because no experience of \u2019\u2019other\u201d\nis in it. \u2014Any limits put on language proscribe the limits of what\nwill be experienced, and, as Wittgenstein remarks, the world can easily\nbe reduced to only the straight rows of the avenues of the industrial\ndistrict, with no place for the crooked winding streets of the old\ncity. \"To imagine a language is to imagine a form of life\"\u2014think of\nthat first \u2019imagine\u2019 as the active word here.\n\n     \"Is there anybody here who thinks that following the orders takes\naway the blame?\u201d Regardless of \"what\" is being said, use of standard\npatterns of syntax and exposition effectively rebroadcast, often at a\nsubliminal level, the basic constitutive elements of the social structure\n\u2014they perpetuate them so that by constant reinforcement we are no\nlonger aware that decisions are being made, our base level is then an\nalready preconditioned world view which this de-formed language \"repeats\nto us inexorably\" but not necessarily.

We think and write in language, which sets up\nan intrinsic connection between the two.\n\nJust as language is not something that is separable from the world, but rather is the means by which\nthe world is constituted, so thinking cannot be said to 'accompany' the experiencing of the world in\nthat it informs that experiencing. It is through language that we experience the world, indeed\nthrough language that meaning comes into the world and into being. As persons, we are born into\nlanguage and world; they exist before us and after us. Our learning language is learning the terms by\nwhich a world gets seen. Language is the means of our socialization, our means of initiation into a\n(our) culture. I do not suggest that there is nothing beyond, or outside of, human language, but that\nthere is meaning only in terms of language, that the givenness of language is the givenness of the\nworld.\n\nAn analogous idea to that of language not accompanying but constituting the world is that language\ndoes not accompany 'thinking'. 'When I think in language there aren't \"meanings\" going through\nmy mind in addition to the verbal expressions: the language itself is the vehicle of thought.'\u00b2\n\n'What does language communicate? It communicates the mental being corresponding to it. It is\nfundamental that this mental being communicates itself in language and not through language.\nLanguages therefore have no speaker, if this means someone who communicates through these\nlanguages.... All nature, insofar as it communicates itself, communicates itself in language, and so\nfinally in persons.\u2019\u00b3\n\n\n  Notes from a series of eleven workshops at the St. Mark\u2019s Poetry Project in the winter of 1980.\n\n\nAs the body is to a person, so language is to the world; to speak of a 'soul' is then to speak of a\nprojection cast by the body. In this sense, to discount the pervasiveness of language \u2014 to be so\naccustomed to its presence that its constituting power over the values and objects of the world is\ndisregarded \u2014 is to avoid the body and with it the materiality of time and space.\n\n                                  He is gone now\n\n                                  Taking his body with him\n\n                                  When all the time\n\n                                  I thought it was\n\n                                  The beauty of his mind\n\n                                  I loved\u2074\n\nIn talking about language and thinking I want to establish the material, the stuff, of writing, in order,\nin turn, to base a discussion of writing on its medium rather than on preconceived literary ideas of\nsubject matter or form. And I want to propose 'thinking' as a concept that can help to materially\nground that discussion. 'Thinking' as the conceptual basis of literary production suggests the\npossibilities for leaps, jumps, fissures, repetition, bridges, schisms, colloquialisms, trains of\nassociations, and memory; as a literary mode it would rely on concepts related to spontaneity, free-\nassociation, and improvisation.\n\nMany writers have wanted to plug into the stream of thinking that seems to\n\nbe constantly going on in the head, or have wanted to cast an image or make a picture of what\nthinking is like, or to actually embody thinking in writing. Some have used thinking as the content of\nthe work, as in genres such as the meditation or contemplative poem. This involvement with\nthinking is a basic passion, a basic desire, in writing. It is one of the attractions to writing poetry and\nreading it.\n\nThe power of hearing a person think out loud is tapped by such relatively recent works as Lenny\nBruce's later spontaneous talks, Kerouac's transcriptions of conversations in Visions of Cody, and\nDavid Antin's talking pieces. Talking improvisationally \u2014 'from the top of one's head' \u2014 can be a\nway of putting thinking into words, with the dynamics of words organized by extemporaneous\nthought and speech rhythms allowing the terrain of the mind at work to open wide. In contrast,\npolite discursive conversation is more a form of mannered behavior than thinking; and, similarly,\nextemporaneous debate, like oratory, is more a replica of formal written exposition and doesn't draw\nas directly on a semblance of 'thinking' for its literary mode. In Antin's work, while the stylistic\nmovement is paratactic and guardedly rambling, the tight rein of the raconteur is present, keeping\nthe discursiveness of what Antin calls 'discourse' foregrounded.\u2075 The talking monologue, a form that\n\n\nis largely based on the model of thinking in public, can also be seen in the 'Talks' issue of Hills\nmagazine.\u2076 Both these examples use transcription of tapes to try to capture the style of live talk. Of\ncourse, the limitation of talks as a model for written thinking is that they tend to be organized in part\nby expository and rhetorical techniques. A work such as Lenny Bruce's 'Live at the Curran Theater' is\nperhaps least invested in such techniques primarily because of Bruce's concern with bringing out his\n'private' obsessions and trains of associations, prompted by his conviction that these are social\ncontents. Whether transcripts of 'unguarded' 'private' conversation record (portray? depict?) the\nthought process more accurately is more likely to be glimpsed from the intensive rapping in Visions of\nCody than in the generally anecdotal tone of the phone call transcriptions in Ed Friedman's Telephone\nBook, a work that suggests that informal conversation is more behavior than thinking, or makes you\nwonder if there's a difference.\u2077 Perhaps the most attractive model is talking to oneself: the soliloquy\nbeing a primary example of a literary formulation for thinking, with the exception that its dramatic\nstructure may be seen as theatricalizing thought rather than exhibiting it.\n\nCertainly 'stream of consciousness' writing satisfies the desire for thinking in writing with maximum\nexhilaration, and as such is a primary example of writing as thinking. Hannah Weiner, in her journal,\ncarries this mode to a contemporary literalness, finding a way to record the continually interruptive\nquality of her thinking, the mind intruding on itself as one worry breaks off and another image takes\nhold.\u2078 Yet these examples, as well, can seem limited by their stylistic casts, throwing them into the\nrealm of literary forms more than manifestations of thinking. But that would take this investigation\ndown the path of looking for the chimerical private experience that cannot be shared. Thinking is\ncertainly a private experience; the problem is that if we try to pin 'thinking' down we project an\nimage of it as an entity rather than, indeed, the very content of language. Like with a dream, the\nexperience slips through our fingers if we try to recount it: we know that the telling of a dream is a\nquite different matter than dreaming itself.\n\nDreaming and thinking are primary subjects for Rene Descartes in his Meditations. The form of\nmeditation, of contemplation, so vividly realized 300 years ago by Descartes, is picked up in\nuncannily similar ways in a number of recent poetry texts.\u2079 Descartes uses the written meditation to\nmake you feel you are with him in his study, the effect is to identify with his thinking so that you feel\nas if you're thinking it too. But despite Descartes' remarkable perspicuity in charting the process of\nthinking through a problem, his meditations are more a formal representation of the thinking process\nthan an immersion in it; and this idealization of reasoning and clarity tend to mediate the pull of\nthought's idle energy. Robert Creeley, sharing the conceit of meditation \u2014 thought presented and\nexamined, weighted and measured \u2014 is more involved with the texture of the process itself, less with\n\n\na representation than an enactment. In 'The Measure', the form of the meditation is used to create a\nmusic of thought, where thinking becomes the material in which the measure is found.\n\n                                     I cannot\n\n                                     move backward\n                                     or forward.\n\n                                     I am caught\n\n                                     n the time\n\n                                     as measure.\n\n                                     What we think\n                                     of we think of \u2014\n                                     for no other reason\n                                     we think than\n                                     just to think \u2014\n                                     each for himself.\u00b9\u2070\n\nWith Ted Greenwald, as with Creeley, the mind thinking becomes the active\nforce of the poem \u2014\n\n                                     Stand next to my head\n\n                                     Examining long and deeply\n\n                                     Each particle that's designing\n\n                                     It's own, ah!, good impression\n\n                                     More than I thought I\n\n                                     Could handle without\n\n                                     Knowing exactly where to\n\n                                     Locate the thought handle ...\n\n                                     Take puffs of links ...\n\n                                     The thought of what's coming ...\n\n                                     Thinking to find a way\n\n                                     To put myself back together\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThe music and rhythm of contemplation become the form of the life, a life, as it is being lived in a\nbody. Indeed with Greenwald, the viscosity of thought is no less than the sheer physical presence of\nthe body in that thought. In Michael Gottlieb's Eidetic Deniers, the thinking stands up out of the\nchair of meditation, merging with perception (as emphasized by the collage-like photos that are\n\n\njuxtaposed with the text). We are looking at thinking as it moves through him\/us and dazzled by the\nsheer beauty of the process so articulated, the measure found.\n\n          afternoon in mind how a giant swap nearly a new wind and talked off into ...\n\n          Like a rock slide ... perfected rift logic ...\n\n          Gloved positions the actuarial synapses hesitation\u00b9\u00b2\n\nThe motivation in this \u2014 to see how the 'world' would\/will come into view, how it works: the\ninvestigation\/creation of human culture. So not just an interest in expression of 'my' thoughts,\nthoughts think the world. In this way, too, the mapping of the free-associative 'thinking' process, the\nordering internal to the movements of the mind\/perception, provides a model for writing in sharp\ncontrast to common expository and representational modes by focusing in on other types of\nmovements from one thing to the next, allowing for writing to be put together in continuously 'new'\nways \u2014 how various shapes and modes and syntaxes create not alternate paraphrases of the same\nthings but different entities entirely.

The desire for writing to be the end of its own\nactivity, its very thatness.\n\nIn looking at Creeley's \u2018A Piece\u2019\u00b9\u00b3 or Brian McInerney's' The World', the articulation of\ncontemplation is an example of how (a technique) words can be brought into one's more total\nawareness in reading, where in reading you are brought up short to the point of the text becoming\nviscerally present to you, the \u2018content\u2019 and the \u2018experience of reading\u2019 are collapsed onto each other,\nthe content being the experience of reading, the consciousness of the language and its movement and\nsound, the page.\n\n                                      outside\n                                      is\n                                      a thought,\n                                      a consecutive thought\n                                      laid down,\n                                      written on a page \u2014\n\n                                      the idea of a room.\n\n                                      for you,\n                                      to you alone\n\n                                      I am alone,\n                                      a leading into\n                                      thought, a\n\n\n                                          solution\n\n\n                                   laid down, reading\n                                   on this page\u00b9\u2074\n\nSimilarly, in Zukofsky\u2019s \u2018It\u2019s a Gay Life\u2019 the wordness of the poem is foregrounded, as a way of\nconcretizing the language, making it visible, sounding it at the level of each phoneme, so that the\nphonemes turning to morphemes turning to words turning to phrases turning to 'poem' is felt,\nheard, made tangible, palpable.\n\n\n                                   There's naw\u2014thing\n\n                                        lak po\u2014ee try\n                                   it's a delicacy\n\n\t\t\t\t\tfor a horse:\n\n                                   Der's na\u2014thing\n\n                                         lak pea\u2014nut\u2014brittle\n                                   it's a delicacy\n\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the molars\u00b9\u2074\n\nRather than making the language as transparent as possible, where these other qualities are repressed\nas a matter of technique (by creating, stylistically, the illusion of the invisibility of wordness and\nstructure), the movement is toward opacity\/denseness \u2014 visibility of language through the making\ntranslucent of the medium. To actually map the fullness of thought and its movement. Cut of\nmind\/perception\/grain of mind ... to ... the factness of the world in the factness of the poem. Poem\nbecoming a perceptual field\/experience 'independent' of 'author'. (Cf: Olson's 'Projective Verse'\nessay: each perception instanter on the next: the form of the poem charts the perception so\neliminating of traditional 'inherited' forms which strip poetry of this active power.) The anti-habitual\nordering of attentions so that attention can be vivid \u2014 the intending rather than assuming of order,\nincluding order of sound\/syllable\/phonemes. So to go from 'thinking' as an activity of 'self' to a\nworld creating\/perceiving idea. Thinking things the world. So that in the end the poem stands as\nanother particular being, hence object, like myself, in the world, and I beside it. And I return not to\nmyself 'as some egocentric center, but experience myself as in the world', that with the meaning and\nlimits therein revealed I have also placed myself.\n\n\n'Limits \/ are what any of us \/ are inside of.' (Olson). '...that order that of itself can speak to all'\n(Zukofsky).\n\nI'm talking here not so much about a motivating theory but a desire: to make language opaque so\nthat writing becomes more and more conscious of itself as world generating, object generating. This\ngoes not only for making palpable the processes of the mind and heart (inseparable) but for revealing\nthe form and structure in which writing occurs, the plasticity of form\/shape. So that writing may be\nan experience in which the forms and objects of the world may seem to be coming into being. The\nmaking invisible of these forms\/structures\/shapes gives the sensation of a world beyond the page\/the\nlanguage that is already given, assumed; whereas the acknowledgement of these forms as materials to\nbe worked with, as an active part of the writing, suggests \u2018our\u2019 participation in the constitution of\nnature and meaning. There is no escape in writing (or 'elsewhere') from structures\/forms, they are\neverpresent \u2014 'de'forming and 're'forming. To see them. To see them as inseparable from 'content'.\n\n\n2. Structure and construction\n\nI have been talking about 'thinking' as a means of locating the materials of\n\nLanguage and writing. This is partly to contrast with literary and expository forms that tend to\nchannel writing \u2014 and so feeling\/thinking\/expression \u2014 into certain set routes. By imagining the\nfree-associative order and relations in 'thinking' as a mode, new domains of compositional possibility\ncan be located, ranges of content\/expression\/meaning can be reached. I want also to suggest that an\nobverse way of looking at writing in which one starts from an rather than an internal approach is a\nmethod of getting to this as well: the use of structures (constructions, programmes) as a way to get to\ndimensions of meaning necessary to put forward the fullness of my experiences and perceptions. \u2014\nBut what is the value of breaking away from habitual psychological or literary tracks, from automatic\nor predetermined patterns? For one thing, such patterns can make us blind to what is going on with\nour feelings\/consciousness and with the world, with others. But more than this the desire is to reveal\nthe specificity, the tone and texture as much as 'content' \u2018summary\u2019 (of experience). Making writing,\nthe activity itself, an active process, the fact of its own activity, autonomous, self-sufficient. That in\nthis way, one becomes more responsible to and for the work, for more dimensions of the meaning. I\nam certainly not, however, advocating gesturalizing the ways language can make meaning; as if to\ndramatize the capacities of language were enough, as if poetry wasn't just as much as ever the\nrevelation of meaning, an active process with language as the medium, requiring an\nacknowledgement that language always occurs in forms and structures. 'Form is never more than the\nextension of content\u2019 \u2014 no bodiless souls or soulless bodies. It is by and through structurings that\n\n\nthe world gets revealed; they cannot, any more than the body can, be avoided. But there is no given\n(set of) structure(s) for all cases; they must always be generated ([re]discovered) anew.\n\nIn constructive writing, the outer structure or parameter, or the method by which a work is\ngenerated, is made visible. is made visible. By 'constructive' partly I'm trying to point to certain\nradicalities or extremes of compositional strategy that tend to increase the artifactual, non-naturalistic\nsense of the poem \u2014 a project that includes a wide range of recent work including Jackson Mac\nLow's chance-derived architectural poems, Ron Silliman's predetermined programmes in 2197 and\nKetjak, Daivid Metnick's and P. Inman's astandard word ('zaum') poems, Ron Padgett\u2019s 'Haiku' \u2014\nFirst: five syllables\/Second: seven syllables\/Third: five syllables\u2019, Paul Violi's 'Index' to an imaginary\nbiography, Clark Coolidge\u2019s \u201coflengths\u2019 \u2014 consisting primarily of prepositions, Lyn Hejinian's\npermutational My Life, Kit Robinson's Dolch Stanzas \u2014 composed entirely from the Dolch list of\ncommon words, to name only a few. Historically, the gematria and other \u2018wordevents' documented\nin Jerome Rothenberg's A Big Jewish Book are relevant; more crucial to the current context is the\nwork of such early modernist Russian writers as Shlkovsky and Khlebnikov \u2014 for example\nKhlebnikov's 'zaum' poems as well as his 'Incantation by Laughter' which is entirely based on prefixes\nand suffixes of the root word for laughter. (Compare also: Steve Reich\/Phil Glass\/Charlemagne\nPalestine; Michael Snow; Ad Reinhardt; Malevich, El Lissitzky, Moholy-Nagy.) ([Expository writing\nas constructive, e.g., Francis Bacon, since exaggeratedly visible paradigmatic syntax and sentence and\nparagraph order?!]) \u2014 in the end, a result of this conscious constructing is that of 'making strange' '\nthe 'alienation effect': To be able to see and feel the force and weight of formations of words,\ndynamics that otherwise go unnoticed; to feel it as stuff, to sound the language, and in so doing to\nreveal its meanings.\n\n\nIn the visual arts the constructive base is perhaps more apparent than in writing where we are seduced\nmore readily into accepting a natural 'speech'-derived syntax or 'logic'-derived discursiveness. For one\nthing, construction is assumed to be an integral part of visual work. Much contemporary sculpture is\nessentially seen as construction. Yet, just as fundamentally, construction is at the heart of writing.\nAnyone who has ever learned to write a newspaper article (who, what, when, where, why) or taken a\ncourse in expository prose is taught about outlines that enable parameters and codes to be set up that\nthe reader will notice and decipher. The front page of The New York Times is, in a sense, a collage or\nsimultaneity with a clearly structured hierarchic meaning to its placements and orderings over the\npage and in each article. Ordering and sequence express values. If, in poetry, we wish to take\nresponsibility for the work, the text, then we must intend the order, take the order as a crucial part of\nwhat we are doing. The idea of order suggests sequence but I also want it to suggest\n\n\nmode\/shape\/form\/structure in which the ordering occurs. The question also arises as to what is the\nunit of ordering \u2014 phoneme, morpheme, word, phrase, sentence, etc. (Syntax is the ordering of\nstrings of words.) What, then, is the measure, measure being the unit or ordering? The measure being\nsomething we discover in writing poetry not something we assume. This would almost distinguish\nwhat I mean by poetry as a type of writing, though that would exclude a common characterization of\npoetry as that writing which uses a measure handed down by tradition, e.g., iambic pentameter. But I\nam putting forward a poetry that does not assume a measure but finds it, articulates it. In this\ncontext, a value in constructive work is that it lays the measure bare to the eye, so that we can see the\nstructuring and how it creates (conditions) meaning by its structuring. So actively displays how\nmeaning in the world comes to be. It is a method that shows how ordering and sequence assert\nvalues, how form limits\/conditions what you can say in it. Which also suggests that all writing exists\nin form, in shape, as mode, in a style, in genres. Some writing may make you more or less conscious\nof this fact \u2014 this is indeed a compositional vector in writing. In starting out talking about 'thinking\u2019\nas a kind of genre of recent poetry I was citing examples of an idea of ordering based on the\n'spontaneous' movements of the mind. This type of \u2018natural\u2019 'free associative' mode I would like to\ncollapse onto the artifactual, \u2018constructive\u2019 mode: both are valuable in that they call the 'measure'\ninto question, take part of the project finding the measure. Any given presentation of order,\nrealization of measure, suggests a world view. In the act of writing, order and structure become\nintegrated into the 'text\u2019, into the experiential realm, where they exist as part of that totality.\n\n                            She measured to the hour its solitude.\n\n                            She was the single artificer of the world\n                            In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,\n                            Whatever self it had, became the self\n\n                            That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,\n                            As we beheld her striding there alone,\n                            Knew that there never was a world for her\n\n                            Except the one she sang and, singing, made.\u00b9\u2076\n\n\n3.  Privacy\n\nI want to keep circling \u2014 from structural and constructive perspectives on poetry back round to a\nseemingly more 'internal' starting point for writing, back, for this moment, to the picture of\nDescartes sitting alone in his study, so as to think about 'privacy' as a central aspect of writing. Poetry\nis a private act in a public place \u2014 the public place being both \u2018language' \u2014 which is shared by all \u2014\nand the page, open as it is to reading and rereading (by oneself and others). For some the search for\nthe private \u2014 that which is true to oneself and for oneself on one\u2019s own terms \u2014 has taken the form\n\n\nof breaking away from highly standardized and institutionalized forms \u2014 indeed, from any\npreviously realized forms \u2014 whether they be literary forms that prize evenness and pentameter and\nhigh tone, or dry descriptiveness, or airy wittiness floating through beautiful mannered stanzas, or\nquasi-logical 'non-fiction' expository forms of argument, discourse, or... \u2014 from automatic or pre-\nscribed patterns. The tangibility of perception or thought, of experience \u2014 how you can get to that.\nThe weight and density of the language entoned \u2014 the ear \u2014 that allows for the specificity, the\nparticularity, of a composition to be felt. The order being the order that comes from one's 'private'\nlistening, hearing \u2014 which in its privacy seems to be the order of the world, even without 'me'. That\nthis measure, these syllables so ordered, this phrase after this thought after this word, brings the world\nonto the page, allows its meanings to be discovered.\n\n*\n\n'The aspects of things that are most important to us are hidden because of\n\ntheir simplicity and familiarity. (one is unable to notice something \u2014 because it is always before\none's eyes.) The real foundations of his or her inquiry do not strike a person at all. Unless that fact\nhas at some time struck him. \u2014 And this means: we fail to be struck by what, once seen, is most\nstriking and powerful.\u2019\u00b9\u2077\n\nThat writing is in some senses the exploration and revelation of that which is private seems the heart\nof the desire to write poetry. A person, alone with their thoughts, takes pen in hand........ Indeed the\nsocial conditions of writing poetry \u2014 that it is not generally work performed for another in exchange\nfor money \u2014 tend to put it, sociologically, in the private (personal) sphere, an avocation performed\nfor 'pleasure'. The final judgments for what is written and how it is written are made, privately, by\nthe writer (although this is often the robotized privacy of the consumer choosing among brands \u2014\nsocial norms can exert a stronger influence in a personal choice than in a collective one). The very\nterms that are often used to characterize positive values in poetry \u2014 personal, confessional, moving,\netc. \u2014 present a picture of poetry as a private expression made public. Literary writing has in fact\nbeen a place where the 'private' secrets of 'our' lives have been laid bare(r) \u2014 where taboos about\nwhat was improper to say have been broken, where the seemingly most intimate secrets of desire and\nbehavior have been spelled out. Even, in fact, where the most commonplace insecurities and egotisms\n\u2014 'masked in public' \u2014 have shown their 'all-too-human' faces. Yet, strangely, the more deeply\npersonal a writer's revelation, the more the writing itself comes to be taken as evidence of a shared\ntruth, not unique to the writer at all. It is almost like the myth of psychoanalysis \u2014 that our most\nprivate fantasies and dreams hold the key by which our behaviors become 'publicly' comprehensible.\n\n\nRousseau's Confessions is an obvious place to look back to for a text that shatters the public illusions\n(i.e., hypocrisies) of both behavior and desire in its quest for 'honesty' ('truthfulness' 'authenticity').\n(The work itself \u2014 the genre is memoir \u2014 is no more a private expression than a public\naccounting.\u00b9\u2078) Certainly, at the time this type of work was both courageous and outrageous. People\nevidently had, as they no longer do, the capacity to be shocked by the details of a person's private life.\nBy now, such details flood the marketplace of literary artifact \u2014 the confessions of the most repulsive\nto the most angelic are a daily part of what we read and hear, seemingly no personal fact about\n\u2018public\u2019 figures is left private. More recently, the experience of many people otherwise inaudible and\ninvisible to the culture at large \u2014 black people, gays, women \u2014 have been recognized as an\nimportant part of literary production, allowing the emergence into the public light of what had been\nmethodically privatized, silenced. The extent of this outpouring of the 'private' has made the\nconfessional mode more and more rhetorical (less and less intimate). Using various 'taboo' contents\ncan read at this point as only a literary device to give the semblance of intimacy and authenticity. To\nsuch an extent that anecdotally personal content has to overcome its manipulative charge in order to\nin any significant way tap into the power that privacy has previously enjoyed. It's not that one\ndoesn't believe the confessions of the private life to be true, but that such confessions take on a style\nand content largely predictable, largely, in a sense, already 'publicized'. So what, then, could the\n'private' be anymore?\n\nOne power of the concept of privacy for writing is that of an address of Intimacy ('truthfulness'\nrather than 'truth' to use Wittgenstein's distinction\u00b9\u2079) that allows the formal requirements of clarity\nand exposition to drop away. 'At home, one does not speak so that people will understand but\nbecause they understand\u2019 (Fuchs). Confusion, contradiction, obsessiveness, associative reasoning, etc.,\nare given free(er) play. A semblance of coherence \u2014 or strength or control \u2014 drops away. In contrast\nto this, or taking the idea further, the private can also seem to be the incommunicable. As if I had\nthese private sensations (or thoughts or feelings) that no one can truly know as I know them. As it\nmy thoughts and feelings are hidden from everyone else \u2014 that I remain in some crucial way an\nenigma to others, or that others seem in some fundamental way enigmatic or closed to me (since I\ncan't feel what they feel, see as they see, etc.) That one's private thoughts are in some ways\nincommunicable would, perhaps, provide an explanation for the 'obscurity', the difficulty, of reading\nsome poetry. As if it were a matter of writing in a 'private language\u2019 that no one else could be\nanything but external to, an outsider. The idea of a private language is illusory because language itself\nis a communality, a public domain. Its forms and contents are in no sense private \u2014 they are the very\nessence of the social. One\u2019s 'private' writing is partly the result of a traditional and contemporary\npractice of such works, always mediated by a larger social production. The investigation or revelation\nof meanings, relying only on one\u2019s own private convictions and insistences, one's ear and the measure\n\n\none finds with it, is not an isolating activity but its opposite \u2014 the exploration of the human\ncommon ground. 'For what is hidden, for example, is of no interest.\u2019\u00b2\u2070\n\nThe intense experience of separation that is a part of the continuing power of privacy in writing can\nmake tangible what otherwise seemed invisible: the world made strange so that we can see it, as in a\ndream of the familiar become foreign. 'One is unable to notice something because it is always before\none's eyes... We fail to be struck by what, once seen, is most striking and powerful.' It is the measure\nthat we have seen, that language is measure. And it is with this that we make our music \u2014 by\nourselves, privately (if so that the measure's seen) \u2014 a private act, a revelation of the public. So that\nthat writing that had seemed to distance itself from us by its solitude \u2014 opaque, obscure, difficult \u2014\nnow seems by its distance more public, its distance the measure of its music. A privacy in which the\nself itself disappears and leaves us the world.\n\n4.  Idleness as the political value of poetry\n\nIn Rousseau's The Confessions he writes of his 'great scheme' for a life of privacy and idleness, far from\nthat other kind of idleness of society's parlors. 'Idleness is enough for me and, provided I do nothing,\nI prefer to dream waking than sleeping ... to live without constraints and eternally at leisure............ The\nidleness I love is not that of an indolent fellow who stands with folded arms in perfect inactivity and\nthinks as little as acts. It is the idleness of a child who is incessantly on the move without ever doing\nanything, and at the same time the idleness of the rambling old man whose mind wanders while his\narms are still.\u2019\u00b2\u00b9\n\nIdleness is a primary desire in poetry \u2014 of a writing that is just for itself, not to be used for some\nother thing, this or that, not to serve up some ideas or tell you a story about what is happening over\nthere, but just in here, in it, content to sit and make a virtue of that, call it non-instrumental (a\nwriting that does not carry a meaning along with it as information to take away, which would make\nthe writing itself there primarily to serve up this information, a shell in itself) where language is not\nin gear, is idling. Laziness as a kind of stubbornness \u2014 at one's own pace, my own measure, & not\ndoing anything, just doing (cf: the lilies of the field, etc.) Instrumentality in contrast is labor done to\nproduce a product, the means for an end. (The model of the factory system of production.) The\nlanguage used to communicate, rather than itself being the communication.\n\n                   The measure all use is time congealed labor\n\n                   In which abstraction things keep no resemblance\n\n                   To goods created; integrated all hues\n\n                   Hide their natural use to one or one\u2019s neighbor\u00b2\u00b2\n\n\nA system of abstraction: the particular, the discrete occurrence, merely a shell, the value residing in\n(underlying in) that which exists as a result of the occurrence, valued only as a means toward the goal\nof a process. Valued only for what a thing produces, its product.\n\n                   Bought to be sold things, our value arranges .\n\n                   But see our centers do not show the changes\n\n                   Of human labor our value estranges.\u00b2\u00b3\n\nWriting as stupor, writing as out-to-lunch. Writing as vacation. Writing degree zero. Idleness as anti-\nstatic (functionless, it becomes estranged.) Writing as idled thinking (not just the means to a\ndisplaced end, becomes world revelation).\n\nInvestigation\/restoration\/vision of the world as self-sufficient.\n\n                   ... how song's exaction\n\n                   Forces abstraction to turn from equated\n                   Values to labor we have approximated.\u00b2\u00b3\n\n& how does poetry idle itself? It is the product of the most intensive labor,\nconcentration, attention. Attention to measure, to the ordering of occurrences, that such occurrences\nare instances of how the world itself comes to\n\n                             There are things\n\n                             We live among 'and to see them\n                             Is to know ourselves'.\n\n                             Occurrence, a part\n\n                             Of an infinite series .\u00b2\u2074\n\nThe language itself idled \u2014 layed-off \u2014 so that even to read a text as \u2018poetry\u2019 would mean to see its\nlanguage as citational \u2014 at minimum doubly valent, both acting to convey information and sounded\nfor its qualities of tone, rhyme, particularness \/ peculiarness of expression, oscillations, vibrations,\nbands of intensity, resonance, i.e., not just \u2018what\u2019 it means but \u2018how\u2019 (a doubleness that can be more\nor less apparent \u2014 another technical vector of the medium).\u2019 That: hearing how this meaning\nformation occurs, is occurring (\u2018the music of poetry is just the experience of sound coming to mean\nsomething\u2019\u00b2\u2075; a music of content) is necessary if we are to \u2018value\u2019 other than the value of abstraction,\ninstrumentation, alienation.\n\n\n                           Hands, heart, not value made us\u00b2\u00b2\n\n\nThe ability to let language resonate absolutely.

I had no need of any other defence against my calumnators........... I could leave\n     them my life to criticize from one end to the other, in the certainty that, notwithstanding my\n     faults and weaknesses, notwithstanding my ability to tolerate any yoke, they would always find\n     me a just and good man, free from bitterness, hatred and jealousy, quick to recognize when I was\n     in the wrong, even quicker to excuse the injustices of others, seeking my happiness always in the\n     gentle emotion of loving, and behaving on all occasions with a sincerity verging on rashness and\n     with a disinterestedness that was almost past belief.

And the confession does not reside in its being a correct and certain\n    report of a process. It resides rather in the special consequences which can be drawn from a\n    confession whose truth is guaranteed by the special criteria of truthfulness. (Assuming that dreams\n    can yield important information about the dreamer, what yielded the information would be\n    truthful accounts of dreams. The question whether the dreamer's memory deceives him when he\n    reports the dream after waking cannot arise, unless indeed we introduce a completely new\n    criterion for the report's 'agreeing' with a dream, a criterion which gives us a concept of 'truth' as\n    distinct from 'truthfulness' here.)

'I had got the habit of going in the evenings to sit on the shore, especially when the lake\n    was rough. It gave me a strange pleasure to watch the waves break at my feet. I made them a\n    symbol of the tumult of the world and of the contrasted peacefulness of my home; and so moved\n    was I at times by this delightful thought that I felt the tears flow from my eyes. This repose,\n    which I so passionately enjoyed, was only disturbed by the fear of losing it; but my feeling of\n    uneasiness was so great as quite to spoil its charm. I felt my situation to be so precarious that I\n    dared not count on it. \"'How gladly\", I used to say to myself, \"would I exchange my liberty to\n    leave this place for the assurance that I could always remain here.\"' \u2014 pp.595-6.\n\n22  Louis Zukofsky, \u2018A'-9 (University of California Press, 1979). All use the measure of abstraction,\n    which assumes value as the end product of an equation (surplus value = rate of profit x cost of\n    labor\/material) rather than inhering in particular occurrences (i.e., labor itself). All use, that is,\n    instrumentality, is thus alienating (estranging), having as its goal the extracting ('extorting') of\n    value (profit). So labor is removed from its 'loci' as maker and turned into a 'token' which 'Flows\n    in unbroken circuit and induces\/ Our being' to its decentering. 'Bought, induced by gold at no\n\n\n    gain, though close eye\/ And gross sigh fixed upon gain have effected\/ Value erected on labour,\n    prevision\/ Of surplus value, disparate decision.'\n\n23  Ibid.\n\n24  George Oppen, 'Of Being Numerous' in Collected Poems (New Directions,\n    1975).\n\n25  Don Byrd, 'Getting Ready to Read \u201cA\"\u2019 (paper presented at the 1980 MLA\n    convention).\n\nN.B. Ron Silliman comments: 'You make out of idleness and privacy the image of the poem & poet at\nwork in all times and within all classes of the production of the same ideological message, wch is an\nidealization at the very least. The fact that poetry is so uneconomic does not alter its economic\ndetermination, but merely demonstrates its weakness as a determination, hence the contradictions\nthat arise & the inevitable overdeterminations ... Poetry is not produced within the personal sphere\nby those who publish \u2014 this is a major distinction between those who consume what they produce\n& those who exchange, as we do, their productions ..... What we finally get is an image of the poet,\nnot a particular one or even of a particular school or generation, wch I don't believe .. Partly, the\nproblem is dehistoricization \u2014 you generalize the word poem to such a degree that it seems timeless\n& (as bad) almost without meaningful distinctions at any given point in time \u2014 the section on\nconstruction notwithstanding .... My sense is that you have to concede the primary socialness of\nliterary production (that poetry exists first as a totality wch then breaks down into structured groups\n& that the individual poet comes at the end of the chain & is far from the center). (However), that\nyou shd deal with the poet as (transhistorical, transaesthetic) individual as the center is .. true to the\nemphasis you give in your poems to vulnerability, doubt & the wrong end of manipulation as\nlanguage codes ...\u2019 \u2014\n\nI don't particularly disagree with the View you put forward about the social preceding the individual,\nbut my sense of using \u2018privacy\u2019 as an issue was to eschew the possibility that language or expression\ncould be \u2018private\u2019 except in an uninteresting way (i.e., hidden) since language is essentially a social\nmedium and poetry a social (i.e., group) expression. Even the idea of 'idleness' is related to the fact\nthat a method of attention\/ critique of the social\/conventional language forms rather than rote\noperations within them leads to a deeper social revelation \u2014 I don't mean to suggest that this method\nis 'private' or 'individual' in its 'essence' but also a socially conditioned one, 'group practice' as you\nsay, & yet this 'group' practice still differs from normative language practice of a larger group\nconfiguration, and individual practices, of course, differ often radically within any grouping.\n(Language is held in common but we each must learn it \u2014 speak it, act it \u2014 for ourselves.) In a\nsense, the 'individual' you suggest I am positing needs to be defined not as a single isolated Romantic\nindividual but as a methodological practice learned in active collective work with other's reading and\nwriting. I do not accept a psychocentric view of persons and, indeed, question whether there are\npreconstituted 'persons' at all in the primary instance (though 'person' may be the most fundamental\nprojection we make). It is to bring back a visceral understanding of the collective nature of\nconsciousness and world that I suggest the things I do. The centrality of the inscription of the\nindividual on the socious cannot be subverted. The nature of that inscription is 'our' investigation.\nThe power of the projection of separateness from the collectivity has to be acknowledged and worked\nthrough, it is the historical situation, the body. So I do maintain the value of the perspective of\nbroken-off-ness (inherent in aspects of both \u2018privacy\u2019 and \u2018idleness\u2019) as central to a genuine social\nrevelation. If I rest on a term like 'poetry' it is to allow for the (talismanic?, ecnoid?) power the\nmedium itself has acquired through its history to emerge: revealing the adherence of individuality and\ncollectivity, binding and unbinding and rebinding.\n\nThanks to Susan Laufer for editorial suggestions.\n\n"},{"uid":"CharlesBernstein_ThreeorFourThingsIKnowAboutHim_1981","author":"Charles

like a living death going to work every day sort of like\nbeing in a tomb to sit in your office you close the door theres\nthe typewriter theres three or four maybe three hours of work to be\ndone between that nine oclock and five maybe I listen to the news on\nwbai if i didnt get it the night before that comes on at nine oclock\n\ni read the newspaper i do anything to distract myself sometimes i\nsleep til around eleven i put both feet up on my desk and i put my\nhand against my head and i close my eyes the time passes if i listen\nto the radio i type a letter i write an article that would make\nthe article that i wrote for that medical newspaper seem like proust\n\nin comparison or sometimes i think initially the job seemed more\nbearable more to the point of just a diversion and source of income\nfor a while until i got unemployment not now but mostly its\n\njust that i'm taking things in a bleaker way i'm not quite sure why\nthat is                          of course the writing writing even\n\ntalking like this always seems to me perfectly at peace so that\n\ni was thinking i dont know this could be my own you know this\ncould be sort of the the source of my crazy hood\/ness that the\nthings that are really valuable dont so much happen as you experience\nthem in the actual present a lot of what i experience is just a\ntremendous sense of space and vacant space at that sort of like a\nStanley kubrick film sort of a lot of objects floating separately\nwhich i dont particularly feel do anything for me give me anything\nmake me feel good        and when i do feel almost best is when i dont\n\ncare  whether they make me feel good whether they have any relation\n\nto me thats a very pleasant thats a real feeling of value in the\npresent moment to just sit and do nothing and thats what writing is\nfor me a lot or just sitting sometimes when i i sit in my office\nwith my eyes closed on my chair and let my mind wander theres a\ncertain sense of not caring and letting it just go by that i like\nand then there is actual relationships you know sometimes touching\nwhether its listening to a piece of music sometimes or talking to\nsomebody a lot being with certain people sometimes but a lot of it\nhas to do with memory & remembering that it was it was something\nthat somehow the value seems to lie historically i look back and\nsee things that really do seem worthwhile and worth it for\ninstance the way i behave    if i try to behave well decently or\n\njustly or whatever it is     that we take to be what we judge ourselves\n\nby    when we have a conversation and we say    thats fucked and thats\n\nnot   whatever we go by in that sense i mean    making that happen\n\n\nbuilding that it does seem you know worth a value funny\nrefreshing nice wonderful or a movie sometimes moments             hours\n\ndays months and then you know even years and lifetimes             sure\n\nbut something in the actual experiencing of it that\n\ndoes seem vacant in the way that a lot is vacant but also\nthe way yeah okay new mexico is vacant\n\nreally i'm you know completely gone just after working by the\ntime i get to this but i am able to concentrate and remember the\ndifferent things ive said so far that seem disconnected see i'm sort\nof condemned to be disconnected and seem disjointed and sort of stupid\nbut really i can remember all the different things ive said i'm sort\n\nof  i dont know its almost a motif thats a major preoccupation with\n\nme  writing the way a relationship is much the way my relationship\n\nwith susan or kimberly or my job more than my job altho it creates\nan enormous number of hassles for me its really as bad as you would\nimagine it would be to work for this mindless healthcare provider\nbureaucracy and the reason why you dont want to work for it is because\nits exploitive of you you are used your body is used my writing\n\nand in that sense its an unsettling experience for me to have to sit\nday after day in an office and be exploited what really bothers me\ntho in addition the rub is the attitude of the other people\n\nthat somehow they could do whatever it is they had to do during the\nday they could be managers they could be bosses they could order\npeople around let the women answer the phones and criticize me for\ntyping and say i should let the secretaries do all the typing they\ncould basically serve this large corporation to the best of their\nability to serve it and to further its particular interests this\nwas actually a non profit corporation and then sort of go out at lunch\nor on the side and on a personal level say to you that really\n\nwho they were at the job the way they behaved at their job what\nthey did all day was not them that the real them the real person\nwas somebody different who went home at night and had liberal\n\nvalues was critical of what the company was doing what the job was\nmaking them do that they really werent what they did at the job they\nwere somebody else that the self that went home at night and watched\ntelevision and went to the movies went out dancing socialized\n\nthat was the real that was the real them and that sort of public\nself the job self was really just a pretense that was necessary to\nsecure a decent living for their families for themselves or a\nchance to have some kind of social power     here again that tremendously\n\ndistorted notion of what a person is and its this concept of a person\nwhich makes me question the whole sense that we generally have of\nwhat a person is that you can imagine that what you do socially that\nthe acts you perform are not you youre really this private thing\nthat doesnt do anything this sort of neutral gear but that whenever\n\n\nyou put that gear into operation when you put yourself into gear\nthats not you or thats only you under conditions when you want to say\nwell i like that and so i'll say well that is me but when youre\nactually doing things that have some effect that isnt you the real\nyou is this personal self and you even get this situation where you\nhave colleagues or professional work friends as opposed to\npersonal friends well he's a personal friend of mine this person is\nsimply a job friend this constant distortion this constant avoidance\nthat you are what you do that insofar as a self is anything its how\nit acts in a social situation what else is a person anyway but a\nsignifier of responsibility for a series of actions if a self is\nanything it is what that self does with its body does with its mind\n\nand that responsibility is for what you do not for what you go home\nat night and think what you'd like to do if if if if one day some time\nit creates at the job place this tremendous vacancy of person\n\nthis tremendous lack of connection with anybody because if people\ndont really think theyre being them all day long in their suits and\nshaved faces and their very reduced mild language and their reduced\nmiddle of the road opinions which they feel is the safest way then\ntheres no way to get a connection with anybody   everything is just so\n\nneutralized that you can work in a place for years and years and\nreally feel no  no clicking with anybody else no contact with\n\nanybody there   you can go out to lunch at the same time as if with\n\nghosts there is no escape from what you do and even if you feel\nyou dont mean what you do dont mean what you say dont mean the way\nyou dress dont mean the kind of business letter language you use\n\ndont mean the division of labor you go along with or that you\ninstitute dont mean the kind of attitudes you have competetively\ntoward your co-workers dismissingly to the secretaries that one does\nmean these things whether one wants to or not that they can be taken\nto be intentional to be you are you who you are and they can be\nread as being you          theres no escape from the nine to five self by\n\nclaiming that the five to midnight self or the midnight to eight self\n\nis not really like this we become selves just because we do different\nthings and its a very hard thing hard to accept that you are what\nyoure forced to be when you go to work and not many feel that they\nwant to get behind the products of their job     but we are behind them\n\n           and i'm not saying well obviously     munitions workers are\n\nnot responsible for the war but its this avoidance of acknowledging\nthe tracks of exploitation and of course for the ambitious for the\nmanagers and upper clerks well that conjuring trick of projecting a\nself outside of ones own actions is practically a way of life\n\n\n3.

COMIC INTERLUDE\n\n     It is the imperialism of the bourgeois psyche that demands a re-\nduction in the number of words able to assume the weight of depicting\nthe world picture. Nouns, because of their proletarian pristineness\nas least distorted by the invasion of bourgeois consciousness into the\nlanguage, as, in fact, the claim goes, repositories of the object resi-\ndue of material existence, are the principal word type favored under\nthis assumption. Viz*. classism, ruling class, third world, exploita-\ntion, revisionist, capital, profit, worker, means of production, aliena-\ntion. 'Verb'al forms emerge mainly in the application of this\u2014\nuberhaupt\u2014principle structure\u2014'exploiting', 'profiting', and also,\n'struggling'*. Individual actions are depicted as reified instantia-\ntions fixed by the intersection of a variety of theses. It is, then,\nour thesis that political writing becomes disoriented when it self-views\nitself as description and not discourse: as not being in the world but\nabout the world. The hermeneutic indicts the scientistic with the\ncharge that it has once again subverted the dialogic nature of human\nunderstanding with its behavioro-empiricism.\n\n\u2018-'Struggle' retains the active principle and is thus undistorted by the\nnoun fetishism that marks infantile forms of Marxist thought. It is the\n'verb*al weight of 'struggle' as shift and dynamic that is the essence\nof a re-hermeneuticized Marxism.\n\n\n6. a fun is what i want to avoid the work of sitting down & m'um the\ncheezy. it's a hundred and forty five miles, you don't go for no\nreason. couldn't stop thinking about it. wanted to go to sleep so\nbad. under. stuff, thing, whats that gnawing, keeps gnawing. switch,\nfug, cumpf. afraid to get down to it. avoidances: movies. i think\nit's rather boring already dAncInG with LaRRy rivers. marKINGs: not\ndone by a machine. hAnDcRaFt. so you get into a scene and you say to\ny'rself\u2014this is it, is outside it, & y'guys all know whats going on.\n\n\nDaddy-O you a hero.

In general I think I have since I was about 12 tended to subdue\nany sentimentality or strong emotional expressions of weakness, fear,\netc., I might have expressed except in the cases of the women I was\nsexually relating to. At that time, I began to see how my parents de-\nmanded expressions of sentimentality, of commitment, of caring, of\nhappy birthday anniversary chanukah, in a way that repelled me from\nany such expressions. In the family situation such expressions seemed\noppressive, they served to lock me further to the jealousy\/possessive-\nness\/control by my family. I completely lost trust in the natural place\nfor depending on other people\u2014because I knew I did not want to depend\non my parents. I extended my feelings about my parents to others\u2014\nwhich could show up as my seeming detached, cynical, cold, intellectual,\ncool. I learned that this distance from others was actually a tool for\nsocial power by manipulation. I learned to think that my only security\nwas in what I could do by myself, alone\u2014i.e. get good marks, do well\nat work, write a good proposal, do good writing. My security was in\nwhat I personally had complete control over. (This is in general\na \"male class privilege\" since a woman\u2014commonly on her own\u2014with kids\nis forced to depend on others just for survival while I could basically\nsay fuck everyone else I'm in it for myself.) In fact, this keeping\npersonal control on one's life, keeping distance, really does get so-\ncial power\u2014it's harder to pin such people down, it's harder to get to\nthem. Anyway, even realizing this I found it hard to find security in\nrelating to other people instead of by being in personal control of my\nlife. It find it scarey to give up that other security (which is power)\nby really trusting\/needing\/relating to others. The thing is that in\nmaking relationships my security\/home I do lose my own control\u2014because\nthere are definite limits to my power, I may have to do something I\ndon't want to or that isn't in my interest, I may get hurt, I may be\npowerless to prevent someone else from getting hurt. In other words,\nin relating to other people, I have to accept their needs\/perceptions\nalong with my own. Is this too abstract?\n\nThe thing is I still can feel my coldness\/distance with other people.\nI find it hard to break that down. I become defensive (self-protective)\nor acerbic\/witty (self-assertive). Some people get through that, see\nme through it. But I think it can be unnecessarily alienating. I donrt\nthink I give people comfort that much\u2014that is, seem to them warm,\nnurturing, supportive. Don't, I sometimes feel, give people a feeling of\n\n\ngetting \"shelter from the storm\/cold\" but rather can be the cold that\npeople seek the shelter from. I have a technique of bathing people in\nthat cold, a puritan conviction that people should know the world is\nhard, and they should face it strong and stern. (& what happens to even\ngood politics expressed this way?) And people should know that, but\nonly sometimes can I transform that realization, go beyond it, and show\nthat one shares that hardness with others, who care. That I am one of\nthem. One of us.\n\n8. \"There are those who worship loneliness \u2014 I'm not one of them; I've\npaid the price of solitude but at least I'm out of debt.\" A precursor\nhere: the worship of loneliness, of being alone, as a way of being\nwhole in the world that demands personal fragmentation as the price for\nfitting into society\u2014the cult of Thoreau, Kierkegaard, etc, in the\nbest and worst sense. So here the rejection, the realization that to\nworship being alone condemns one to isolation. Butt the reward of\nsolitude is yet to be out of debt; to owe no one anything, the self\nmade man, on your own and in control\u2014the delusion of security in\nisolation, if you keep yr ass clean kid youll be okay, look out fer\nyrself, yr numero primo. And so the ravages of the world have forced\nus to be warriors, ravaged we take control of our individual lives\nfighting for the warmth of inside we've had to give up. \"Come in she\nsaid I'll give you shelter from the storm.\" She she she, waiting:\nready to comfort, to nurture, to support our shipwrecked egos. And so\nwe take the comfort, but without transforming ourselves\u2014she simply\ncomforts, offers shelter, but we remain in the world of \"steel eyed\ndeath\" (a steely idea that)\u2014exchange no words \"between us\". There is\n\"little risk involved\" because we have held fast to our isolation,\nsimply allowing it to be warmed. \"Come in she said I'll give you\nshelter from the storm.\" But there can be no shelter until we our-\nselves provide it each for the other together. Without that there\nwill always be \"a wall between us\"; then the steely idea triumphs:\n\"Nothing really matters, it's doom alone that counts.\" And yeth\n\"Love is so simple, to quote a phrase, you've known it all the time\nI'm learning it these days.\" So simple and yet so seeming sentimental\nto say, as if sentimentality were the curse that prevented us from\nknowing how simple love is in our repulsion to its being demanded by\nour families\/country\/society at the price of self-abnegation. And so\nin the flight from the oppressive obligations of sentimentality; of\npolite hellos and demanded, guilt-ridden, love; in the retreat into\nthe isolation and security of personal control, needing no one; a\nnative sense was lost that love is so simple, to quote a phrase, that\nwe are each for each other shelter from the storm, if we are not afraid\nto come in, or take another into where we are. But still all this\nwhile the secret has been known (\"you've known it all the time\") if\n\n\nonly we had \"spoken words between us\", had taken that \"risk\". The\nwords sound sentimental\u2014I love you I miss you it hurts me so bad\nwith a pain that stops and starts\u2014words of separation, of close-\nness, of hurt, of joy\u2014we choke on them: there is no depth here, no\nunique sensibility: everyone says them. But still the curse can be\nbroken by their utterance. \"I can change I swear.\" \"It's the price I\nhave to pay.\" \u2014The commitment is to \"cross the line\" from the \"for-\neign countries\" each of us inhabits; someday to dissolve into a now.\n\n9. \"It's like spelling. You know that whole sense that spelling\nthings right in English is really sort of an aristocratic notion. You\ncould tell the educated few by the fact that they spelled the same.\nWhich I'm told is a lot of their system of education...because in\nShakespeare's time he spelled his own name a lot of different ways,\nnot to mention other words. You know, it was really like a body of\nmaterial that would identify you as one of the educated people. Think\nof all the time we've spent in school spelling things right. Sort of\na tremendous waste of time.\"\u2014Coolidge\n\n10. Ethics & aesthetics become increasingly \"out there\". Dress &\nsyntax & right behavior are copied from presented models, a process of\nemulation rather than interpretation. Clerks & secretaries spend their\ntime typing neatly, removing idiosyncracies from the language & pre-\nsiding over a tan neutrality\u2014\"unobtrusive\"\u2014with the smoothness of\nflow allowed by explanatory transition.\n\nTopic sentence. However; but; as a result. Blah, blah, blah. It\nfollows from this. Concluding sentence.\n\nMeaning, coherence, truth projected \"out there\" as something we know\nnot for ourselves but as taught to us. (One day, maybe, we will be\nexperts.)\n\nIt goes like this. \"Clear writing is the best picture of clear think-\ning.\" Providing a clear view. (An imperial clarity for an imperial\nworld. ) An official version of reality, in which ethics is transformed\ninto moral code & aesthetics into clean shaving, is labelled the public\nreality & we learn this as we would a new language. (Orthography &\nexpository clarity are just other words for diction & etiquette.)\n\nImperial reality has as its essential claim not so much that it is a\nversion of reality but that it is the version, i.e., (imperially) clear.\nThat the composition of reality is suprapersonal: the mistakes & plain\ntakes of a person are not an essential part of reality's composition.\nStandardized spelling, layout, & punctuation enter into a world of\n\n\nstandardization\u2014clocks & the orbit of the moon & the speed of light.\nA social science epistemologically self-conceived on the model of the\nnatural sciences becomes possible & grammar becomes a social science.\nLanguage is thus removed from the participatory control of its users &\ndelivered into the hands of the state. Text is no longer regarded as\nrequiring interpretation: rules for appropriate spelling & syntax are\ndetermined by consultation with generalized codes of grammar removed\nfrom their contextualized source in a text. (The Hebrew handwritten\ntext required interpretation not only in respect to the meaning of its\nethical & ritual tenets but even for the placement of vowels.) Decon-\ntextualized codification of the rules of language enforces a view that\nlanguage operates on principles apart from its usage. These rules are\nnot \"picked up\" but taught. Failure to produce appropriate language\nis regarded not as misperception but as error. The understanding begins\nto be lost that we are each involved in the constitution of language\u2014\nthat our actions reconstitute\u2014change\u2014reality.\n\nIt's a question of who controls reality. Is reality \"out there\" (as\nscientism tells us) or rather an interaction with us, in which our\nactions shape its constitution? Prescribed rules of grammar & spelling\nmake language seem outside of our control. & a language, even only\nseemingly, wrested from our control is a world taken from us\u2014a world\nin which language becomes a tool for the description of the world,\nwords mere instrumentalities for representing this world. This is re-\nflected by the historical movement toward uniform spelling and grammar,\nwith an ideology that emphasizes non-idiosyncratic, smooth transition,\nelimination of awkwardness, &c, \u2014anything that might concentrate\nattention on the language itself. For instance, in contrast to, say,\nSterne's work, where the look & texture\u2014the opacity\u2014of the text is\neverywhere present, a neutral, transparent prose style has developed\nin certain recent novels where the words seem meant to be looked\nthrough\u2014to the depicted world beyond the page. Likewise, in current\nmiddle of the road poetry, we see the elimination of overt rhyme &\nalliteration, with metric forms retained primarily for their capacity\nto officialize as \"poetry\". (That older texts are closer to hand-\nwritten & oral tradition is partial explanation for this, but having\nmachines for uniform printing necessitates neither a uniform writing\nnor the projection of a suprapersonal world.)\n\nMuch of the spirit of modernism has been involved in the reassertion of\nthe value of what has come to be fantasized as subjectivity. Faced\nwith an imperial reality, \"subjectivity\" is first defined as \"mere\nidiosyncracy\", that residue of perception that is to be discounted,\nthe fumbling clouds of vision that are to be dissolved by learning.\nBut in just this is the ultimate subjectivity of a people: stripping\nus of our source of power in our humanness by denying the validity of\n\n\n\nour power over the constitution of our world through language. The myth\nof subjectivity and its denigration as mere idiosyncracy\u2014impediments to\nbe overcome\u2014diffuses the inherent power in the commonness of our alien-\nation: that rather than being something that separates us, alienation\nis the source of our commonness. I take it that this is why Marx saw\n\u2090s inevitable that a proletariat conscious of its alienation would be\nable to develop human relations\u2014solidarity\u2014which would be stronger\nthan any other human power.\n\n\nThe poetic response to the imposition of an imperial reality has been\nto define subjectivity, by a kind of Nietzschean turn around, not as\n'mere' but as exalted. The image of the poet as loner & romantic\ncontinues to condition this response. An unconscious strategy of con-\ntrariety develops\u2014that the official manners & forms are corrupt &\ndistorted & only the private & individual is real. Beat\u2014to abstract\n& project a stance, acknowledging the injury this does to the actual\npoetry\u2014is an obvious example, as is Surrealism, itself & as an in-\nfluence. These two modes\u2014for the moment letting them stand for a much\nwider variety of literary response\u2014are grounded in reaction. Beat\npoetry, as such, could go no further than the dramatization of alien-\nation; the genesis of much of its considerable & indispensable formal\ninnovation is (quite justifiably) epat\u00a3 la bourgeoisie. (The rhapsodic\nother side was, at the least, pastoral romanticism; at its best it put\noff the theatre of vision for the language of presence.) Likewise,\nSurrealism, in itself, could do little more than theatricalize our\nalienation from official reality, since it is completely rooted in\nbourgeois spatio-temporal perception: it simply distorts it. Both\nBeat & Surrealism are essentially poetries of gesture, viz: reality\nis different from our schooled conceptions of it, more fantastic, more\n-------. In these modes, to use Stanley Cavell's phrase, the moment\nis not grounded but etherialized: alienation is not defeated but only\nlandscaped.* What is needed, now, is not the further dramatization\nof far-outness but the presence of far-inness. These modes have shown\na way. Surrealism & Beat broke open syntax & placement of words on the\npage, they widened the range of content & vocabulary, they allowed\nshape & texture & hover of consciousness to become more important than\ndescription. Unfortunately, much current poetry goes no further, fix-\nated on the idea of establishing the value of the interior world of\nfeeling, irrational (whimsical) connections, social taboos, the per-\nsonal life\u2014over & against \"official\" reality.** As if we didn't\nalready know that \"bad grammar\" can speak more truthfully than correct\ngrammar, that learning & expertise don't really impart knowledge, that\nprivate fantasies don't coincide with public property. It's not that\nwe don't need to hear these things again & again, anymore than that\nthat is the objection to socialist realism, but that there is so much\n\n\nmore we can do than simply underline the fact\u2014& describe the conditions\n\u2014of our alienation, of the loss of the world's presence to us. (As if\nit were enough to simply mourn & not organize.) The promise of the\nreturn of the world can (& has always been) fulfilled by poetry. Even\nbefore the process of class struggle is complete. Poetry, centered on\nthe condition of its wordness\u2014words of a language not out there but in\nhere, language the place of our commonness\u2014is a momentary restoration\nof ourselves to ourselves.\n\n*Likewise, this is true of the avant-gardism & conceptualism, taken for\nthemselves as a stance, which pervade much of the seventies art scene.\n\n**This helps to explain the almost ideological anti-intellectualism\u2014\n\"dumbness\"\u2014that runs through some poetry circles.\n\n11. \"At home, one does not speak so that people will understand but\nbecause people understand.\"\u2014Fuchs\n\n12. & obviously we're committed to political struggle, to the neces-\n\nsity of changing current capital distribution, to making the factories\n& the schools & the hospitals cooperatives, to finding a democracy that\nallows for the participatory authority of each one to the extent of the\nresponsibility we place on her or him. there are no prefixed means &\nthe answer is in us struggling & discussing & deciding as groups &\nacting. & it troubles\u2014isn't this incessant writing & questioning\nwriting a diversion? isn't the business...? well, but language is\nour business, fully as much as 'acting', anyway, how do you pre-\nsuppose to separate out the deed & the reflection? you might say we've\ngot dual responsibilities, & one doesn't take us off the hook of the\nother, writing, by itself, does not further class struggle. \"it is a\nfertilizer not a tool.\" pound's politics don't in any way diminish the\npower & significance of his writing, nor do they limit the aesthetic\/,\npolitical value of the work, but that in no way absolves the man from\nhis own political responsibilities. social credit\u2014to be a little\nsilly & talk about measuring it\u2014is really a multiplication of the\n\"dual\" responsibilities. & a zero multiplied by even an astronomical\nfigure doesn't get you very far. i'm not saying the \"private\" literary\nactivity is separable from the \"public\" conduct. i'm saying a person's\ngot a variety of responsibilities (if to say 'dual' then only when\nspeaking of a particular conflict)\u2014& it's not okay to be a bully just\nbecause you're wearing a pretty dress. there's no end to\nresponsibilities. & poetry, well, it's in a sense an additional\nresponsibility\u2014as a man or a woman you'd not lose 'credit'\nfor not doing it. it's not that aesthetic consciousness &\npolitical consciousness are essentially different, quite the opposite,\nbut really this is the goal: reunification\u2014in practice\u2014of what we\nnow face as multiple demands. the power of poetry is, indeed, to\n\n\nbridge this gap\u2014for a moment\u2014by providing instances of actualization,\nit is a glimpse, but, sadly, for us, now, no maker is able to reap\nthe legitimate rewards of his or her labor. & so our responsibilities\nremain multiple & we are called on to fulfill all of them.\n\n13. We imagine there is a gap between the world of our private phan-\ntasies & the possibilities of meaningful action. & so it becomes easy\nto talk & talk on what is lacking, to discourse on end, & yet feel\nimpotent. 'What's to do.' But this gap is the measure not so much of\nour desires or depression or impotence but of ourseZv^s. It has been\nthe continual failure of Marxist aesthetics to insist that this gap is\nsimply another illusory part of our commodity lives. It is at the root\nof our collectivity.\n\n14. The essential aspect of writing centered on its language is its\npossibilities for relationship, viz, it is the body of 'us'ness, in\nwhich We are, the ground of our commonness.\n\nLanguage is commonness in being, through which we see & make sense of\n& value. Its exploration is the exploration of the human common\nground. The move from purely descriptive, outward directive, writing\ntoward writing centered on its wordness, its physicality, its haecceity\n(thisness) is, in its impulse, an investigation of human self sameness,\nof the place of our connection: in the world, in the word, in our-\nselves .\n\n15. The situation, the relations, the conditions under which. The\ntask of unchaining & setting up. They hankered to & the people pro-\nclaimed an abbreviated stroke no more than a ruffling of the surface.\nAn entire people: that by means of a revolution had imparted itself a\npower of motion suddenly finds itself back to the old dates the old\nnames a dim burning lamp fastened to the head behind a long whip. Men\n& things seem set in sparkling brilliance till a pale casts over. The\nriddle is not solved by turns of speech, the fixed idea of making gold,\nwhich in the press fall victim to the courts & even more equivocal\nfigures. An array of passwords maintained against a wider one. Plac-\nards are posted on all street corners. The priests appear & wail about\nthe necessity of moral reform. A drive against the schoolteachers.\n(Even bourgeois liberalism is declared socialistic.) Its gladiators\nfind their ideals wholly absorbed in products & Caesar himself is\nwatching over. Antediluvian colossi disappear into sober mouthpieces\nwith suitable up to date manners knocking feudal manners like someone\nwho has just learned a new language always translating back into the\nfirst. \"Property, family, religion, order.\" The bureaucracy is well\ngallooned & well fed. The individual turns in stupefied seclusion &\nthe peasants dwell in hovels. A bunch of blokes push their way forward.\n\n\n  \u2014When the real aim is achieved & society is accomplished. As when we\n  find our way in it without thinking in terms of the old. The event\n  itself appears like a bolt from the blue.\n\n\nCHARLES BERNSTEIN\n\n\n\n  This essay is reprinted from A Hundred Posters (edited by Atari Davies),\n  issue #26, February 1978."},{"uid":"CharlesBernsteinandBruceAndrews_ThePacificaInterview_1981","author":"Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews","shortTitle":"The Pacifica Interview","title":"Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews | The Pacifica Interview | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1981","date":1981,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":null,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEsupp3\/pictures\/025.html","text":"\n            THE PACIFICA INTERVIEW\n\n\n\n(The following is a transcript of an interview of the editors by Susan\nHowe, taped in March 1979, and broadcast over WBAI-FM, Pacifica Radio in\nNew York City. )\n\n\n\n\nCHARLES BERNSTEIN: L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E came out of our interest as writers\nof poetry in having discussion of works that interested us and of issues\nof politics and philosophy and other arts that seemed related to that\nwork. A lot of what we've done is to allow the active kind of energy\nthat goes into writing poetry to pervade the discussion that goes on in\nthe magazine, so for someone who wasn't used to that it might even seem\nlike the reviews or comments or critical articles were poems. That is to\nsay, there is no standard expository style used, nor a standard style of\npunctuation for that matter. And the articles just take off right in the\nmiddle, assuming, very often, some knowledge of the terms of an ongoing\ndiscussion. It's the kind of publication that could only be put out by\npeople actively engaged in writing. Although what constitutes being\nactively engaged in writing is an open question we're interested in\nexploring.\n\nSUSAN HOWE: Do you feel that there is a specific group of people that\nare working along lines that interest you?\n\nCB: I think that there are traditions within American literature, within\npoetry, within twentieth century art, as well as a number of contemporary\nwriters that together form a matrix of active interest. All those things\nseem like confluences. As a magazine, we have a few hundred subscribers,\nwe have about 200 different people who've written for us, a number writing\nnumerous pieces, and this obviously defines a certain area of interest.\nThere are writers and magazines that Bruce and I share a commitment to,\nare interested in writing about and talking about. But we don't exhaust\nthe limits of our interests in the magazine.\n\nSH: It seems to me that similar dialogue to that going on in L=A=N=\nG=U=A=G=E could have been found in Art forum when it was really going\nstrong in the late 60*s or early 70's, and a little bit in October maga-\nzine.... I'm not talking about the critics, but the works that they are\nwriting about.\n\nBRUCE ANDREWS: I think that specifically the kind of work that I'm most\ninterested in deals with questions that have been dominant in other\nadvanced arts in the century and have to do with what is customarily\nthought of as the modernist project in those other arts\u2014that is, an\nexploration of the intrinsic qualities and possibilities of the medium in\nwhich the art takes place. And that is an exploration that's been carried\n\n\non in all the arts, and it's been carried on in the recent critical work\nrelated to most of the other arts. Now, I think there are any number of\nsub-traditions and active traditions of writing that explore some of those\nsame issues having to do with the nature of the medium, which from our\npoint of view is language. The medium of writing is not some concocted\nverse tradition that comes down to us through academic discourse and what\npeople are taught in school and what book reviewers in The New York Times\ntell us that poetry is all about; it has to do with writing as an explora-\ntion and a presentation of the possibilities of language. And that ex-\nploration has gone on in the writing throughout the century in a number of\ndifferent traditions. It's something a number of poets around the country\nand in Europe now talk about but most of that discussion has taken place\nprivately in correspondance, people's journal writing, etc. We've all\nbeen engaged in that project in the mail and in conversation for years\nand are trying in a small way by doing the magazine to get some of that\ndiscourse out into a more public realm. That way the participation can be\nsomewhat less restrictive\u2014where it isn't just a matter of what particu-\nlar person you happen to be close friends with or happen to have access to\nthrough the mail that you carry on this wonderful dialogue with, but to\nget some of that out in a more public way, to build a sense of community,\nto some extent, to get some of the issues clarified, to get the informa-\ntion around in a somewhat easier fashion, and to try to do it ourselves as\nwriters, rather than constantly having these questions mediated by some\nparticular critical establishment, which I think is one of the reasons why\nwriting, if it has lagged behind some of the other arts in certain ways,\nthat's one of the reasons. Because the discussion about writing has been\nlargely carried on by conservative English professors, in the United\nStates.\n\nCB: But, of course, it's not writing that has lagged behind the other\narts but rather that people's awareness of the work has lagged behind.\nThere is an enormous repression of knowledge about even the American\ntraditions of writing. Lots of the important work done in the early part\nof the century remains far more obscure than comparable works in the\nvisual arts, which has had a well-funded critical industry to sell inno-\nvation as the basis of creating ever higher market values not only for\nnew work but for the early innovations which make up their traditions.\n\nSo the public climate about writing is much more conservative, the inter-\nesting work is much less visible. In the fifties and sixties most of the\nwork published by the commercial and university presses represented a\nvery minor and not very interesting kind of work that involved the most\nreactionary possible interpretation of the work of people like Pound, and\neven Williams. For a lot of people, who may read or even write for the\nart magazines, that's all they see of poetry.\n\n\nSH: It's interesting to me because, for instance, you had Black Mountain\n\n\n\nwhich produced an incredible amount of interesting writing and music and\nvisual art. The visual artists that came out of that now have a tremen-\ndous amount of critical approval in America \u2014 they are taught in the\nschools, they are in museums, they are written about in The New York\nTimes. But when it comes to the writers, this has not been the case.\n\n\nCB: There's been enormous sums of money involved in the promotion of the\nvisual arts, while most of the money in the poetry world is university\nrelated and goes, by and large, to a very restricted, a very boring, kind\nof work that relates more to the lives and sensibilities of people who\nteach in academic institutions, which, not simply to dismiss it, does\nhave a certain popularity because of this context. Anyway, poetry is\ndifficult to understand; in the time it takes to read one poem and just\nget the most initial hit you could look at a number of paintings, not that\nyou would be able to fully understand them of course. But the society is\nmore geared to a certain kind of superficial consumption of art, which is\nhard to do with a poem, especially one that has any formal complexity:\nit's not right there to be seen, whether or not it's understood. Cer-\ntainly, the popularity of someone like Jackson Pollock doesn't necessarily\ncome from an intimate understanding of the kind of textures he created and\nhis ability, as they say, to achieve an opticality in his works and over-\nall nonfiguration that you might think of from a formalist point of view.\nBut rather, the fact that his work is sold for a lot of money and so on,\nthat you can buy a little snapshot of one of the paintings or a postcard\nand consume the image. Poetry is much harder to consume at that level.\nIt's hard to get a sense of what the poem is at all. There's not really\nan image. Either it looks the same as all poetry has looked with stanzas\nand so on, or it looks like words scattered on a page. It's hard to get\nthat immediate hit off of what it is; it's missing a certain immediate\nflash some of the other arts have.\n\n     Following up on something Bruce said, I'm interested in looking at\nthe tradition of writing as something broader than simply the verse tradi-\ntion or anything like that. Since this gets away from a more central\npoint for me, which does not separate poetry out from other forms of\nwriting, which is the exploration of how language shapes the way we see\nthe world\u2014how we come to see the world in terms of language. Lots of\nthe poetry I find most exciting and most beautiful gives a sense of how\nlanguage creates the world; it lets you see the world and the actual\nformation of the world more closely. So there's an affinity here with\ncritical thought, and to Marxist thought. I mean I think the work can\nboth provide a social critique and be a poem that stands on its own.\nSometimes the categorization of writing into its genres is misleading;\noften these genres are no more than format distinctions, as in the case of\nprose format, which really cannot distinguish between poetry and what is\nso often called 'prose'. If you look at the whole range of writing that\n\n\ngoes on, just look at different newspapers, different kinds of technical\ninformation manuals, and all the other types of writing that gets produced\nin our society, and look at them with an eye to what kind of a quality of\nworld is being created by it. This is where the work of Burroughs and\nMac Low in the fifties and sixties fits in and is so important. Cutting\nup \"found\" language, juxtaposing, rearranging, to see what kinds of\nresults you get. That you can deal with language as this material we are\npervaded by, which we as writers take as the material with which we do our\nwork: how we ourselves are created out of the ways this material is used.\nAnd that entails seeing language not as a transparency, not as something\nwhich simply dissolves as you get a picture of the world in focus, so\nthat, in reading a text, you are hardly aware of the language at all. I\nam more and more interested in becoming conscious of language when I write\nand in reading work which is conscious of its qualities as language, and\nin that sense not trying to eliminate idiosyncracies or other kinds of\nthings that prevent just using the language as a disappearing act that\ngives you the world on the other side. Which is basically a way of\nconsuming, of making the world into a commodity you just consume, rather\nthan seeing how the world is actually constructed through language.\n\nSH: Are there any basic texts that you go back and back to \u2014 just to\ngive the listeners some idea of where you are coming out of?\n\nBA: You are talking about traditions in the other arts, you are talking\nabout the Dadaists, the Russian Futurists, you are talking about differ-\nent moves in the tradition of the novel, you are talking about different\nthings going on in the visual arts. For me, things like jazz and impro-\nvisatory music in the sixties and seventies have been very important.\nThe new music coming out of Cage and the traditions he harkens back to.\nYou have this confluence of all these different streams, all these\ndifferent traditions, most of which have been shuttled to the side of\nwhat's considered important in writing. And it isn't so much that we're\nheroically trying to bring all these things together. I mean these are\nthe kinds of mixes of different traditions that many of the writers are\ninterested in or cut into at some point. All of these traditions, plus\nothers that don't come to mind as quickly, are operating in the writing\nof the people we're concerned with, so the discussion sometimes centers\naround some of these sub-traditions, some of those active streams of work.\n\nSH: Some of those are original traditions, I mean obviously it's better\nto go back to the sources like Melville or Thoreau, but it seems to me\nthat there has been a re-interpretation of those basic texts by some\nmodern criticism that for me has shaped my thinking, like S\/Z by Barthes,\nwhich profoundly affected my way of looking at different texts.\n\nBA: Right, but did it get us all to go back and read Balzac, that's the\nquestion. It's a question academics don't usually confront.\n\n\nSH: It could certainly get me to go back and redo it a little bit. I\nmean, I think the Freudian thing too, Freud has been very important.\n\nBA: I think it's true in the last 10 or 20 years you have a wide range\nof activity going on in the critical community. Most of it is not so\nmuch centered around writing, although that is more the case now in\nFrance and with some of the trendier English departments in the U.S. that\nhave picked up on some of the French theorists. But you also have whole\nranges of philosophical traditions. You have the whole Marxist tradition\nof ways of looking at social phenomena as material, as production, as\nconstrained by underlying principles operating at the social system level\nand the question of how that affects our sense of distance from language\nversus our sense of involvement and participatory involvement in it. Not\njust as something that we consume, something that is out there as this\n'window on the world' that we're supposed to simply pass through and\ntherefore come to accept and be socialized into: some particular way of\nlooking at the world which essentially is one of acceptance, a kind of\nglassy-eyed consumptive way of dealing with the world instead of seeing\nthat in fact language is this vessel or this environment that we operate\nin which shapes our world, shapes our sense of ourselves, which is also\nincredibly constrictive. Something that I think a lot of this writing\ntends to try to undercut is the notion of a sovereign self and a sovereign\nsubject as the center of meaning in a text\u2014which I think again is not\nonly a limited and limiting notion, but a notion that derives from the\noperation of an oppressive social system that we all are living under.\nTo some extent we are living out society's alienating qualities without\nbeing encouraged to look at what these qualities are, to see how aliena-\ntion is related to, say, traditions of representation in the arts or in\nwriting, how all those things operate together. So you have people\nworking in these areas as writers, and you also have people doing serious\nthinking and conceptualizing about these things, and both of these have\ninfluenced my own way of looking at what writing is and what the possi-\nbilities for writing can be, both socially and on the page. So, in that\nsense, you have a much messier field of vision here in terms of what\nseems important and what seems worth thinking about.\n\nCB: When Bruce or I will talk about a political or Marxist, specifi-\ncally a Marxist perspective, it is different than the traditional sense\nof socialist realism which I find fairly abhorrently limited as a view of\nwhat art could be. Obviously, to people who support socialist realism\nas what Marxist art would be or political art would be or what socialist\nart would be, the work that we do might seem terrifically privatized,\nindividualized, abstract and all kinds of bad things, I'm sure. I think\nthat what political art does, or art that has political concerns, let me\nput it that way because I don't know what it would mean to say political\nart, art that has the kind of concerns that Marx himself had and that in\n\n\ngeneral people that have radical social views have, is to look at soci-\nety and how values are constituted within in, how the world comes to\nmean things, how labor is always removed from an understanding of what a\nproduct is, and so on. To try to bring these things out, look at them,\nand make it more apparent in the writing. So that what I am interested\nin doing is stopping the sense of transparency in language, that langu-\nage is this neutral thing that people don't have a part in. Because it\nis people that make up language and change language and in that way\nchange reality. If you accept the concept that language is a relatively\nfixed system for describing the world, which is essentially a notion\nthat academic concepts of writing have and share with socialist realist\nsenses of writing, you have given over what I think is the major area of\nstruggle, which is the control over the constitution of reality. Let me\ngive an example of that, which would be spelling. The idea that there\nshould be uniform spelling and uniform diction has been recently combat-\nted by a lot of people favoring more acceptance of black English and\ndialects in the school. These are very revealing arguments to hear\nabout language. Language is not something that exists in stasis and it\ndoesn't have any intrinsic uniformity. The idea that everyone should\nspell things the same, not that I don't think it's a crucial social sur-\nvival skill to know correct spelling, but the idea is still based on an\nelitist notion of writing as being something for an aristocracy who have\ncohesive social views and so on. In Shakespeare's time people didn't\neven spell their own names the same way. There was that sense that\nlanguage was much more in flux, much more able to be shaped. The more\nand more you move to the concept that subject\/verb\/object sentences, the\nway I'm talking now, is somehow clearer, the more and more you move to\naccept what almost might be called an imperial sense of what clarity is,\nthat language can imperially just dissolve and give you the world and\nthat the world really is correct spelling, that a table really is t-a-b-\n1-e. That in fact different idioms, different ways, confusions, what\nare called idiosyncracies of diction, actually indicate a different\nworld, different perceptions, different kinds of values. And that rath-\ner than try to bring everybody over to a white Western framework for\nwhat the world is and for describing the world, it is important to ..m\nunderstand that every difference in spelling, every 'unclarity', every\n'awkwardness' means something if a person uses it, and that you can\nread it and it tells you something, and to value that, to value the C\nfact that language evolves and changes. And that people can begin to\ntake control of the language and changing the language and not having\nthis enormous insistence on no mistakes, no typographical errors, no\nspelling mistakes, no grammatical errors, parallel structure, all these\nthings that construct 'a' world but not 'the' world. For if you buy\nthat it's the world you are buying an enormous amount which I think is\nbasically related to managerial control of this society by large capi-\n\n\ntai interests. You buy a conception of reality, that the world really\ndoes exist in this way as described by these clear expository sentences,\nand it doesn't. The world exists in the ways we create it and we can\nlearn how to see the world in different ways and a lot of cracks in\nthat system by beginning to explore alternative methods of writing and\nthinking and talking.\n\nBA: And reading and listening.\n\n\nSH: Editing is very important in that context. When you are given an\nanthology of poetry in school, you have the standard spelling. But if\nyou go back to a really well-edited book of 18th century poetry or of\n17th century metaphysical poets and see the way they spelled, it opens\nthings up. Those poems just jump alive off the page because of the dif-\nferent spelling. So that's terribly important when it comes to editing.\nLook at what they did to Emily Dickinson. Her poems for years appeared\nin dribs and drabs; they were slowly coming out but with the dashes re-\nmoved and the capitals all made small.\n\nCB: In the name of uniformity and standardization of language.\n\nSH: Yes, but half the life was there in what she was trying to do with\nher dashes and capitals.\n\nBA: You are being encouraged when this sort of thing happens to take\nfor granted the larger social context in which everybody is operating.\nYou are talking about active writing, yet you are also talking about a\nspeech situation out of which these norms of clarity come. I mean that's\nwhat this clarity is supposed to be all about. But what happens in a\nspeech situation is that you're forced or encouraged to take for granted\nthe context in which you are embedded. That's one of the things I am\ninterested in trying to undercut\u2014it's that failure to recognize what\nthe system is that everyone is working within. But people can come to\nsee language first of all as a changing system, as this system that has\nits own rules and its own norms and its own constraints, pretty well in-\nstitutionalized, that shapes not only the writing or reading that goes\non within in but also the people who are precipitated out of it: the\nwhole idea of subjects and bodies coming out of it. If they can not u\nonly only recognize the limitations and constraints which the system pro-\nvides, but also begin to think of writing as a practice within the sys-\ntem, a practice that is displaying that system, problematicizing it,\nmaking it look like something that has developed historically, that you\ndon't have to take it for granted, that you can make moves within it,\nthat you can create changes within it, that you can take control of that\nYou no longer have to think of the system as this apparatus of social\n\n\ncontrol that we're all going to be subjected to all the time. So to\nthat extent I think of the way writing uses language as a paradigm for\nhow people can operate within this larger social system, and that's what\nI think are the broader political implications of some of these kinds of\nwriting we've been interested in. It's not a question of mobilizing the\nmasses to form large majorities that can take power in some straightfor-\nwardly political sense; it's the question of analyzing, critiquing,\nproblematicizing the structure of power itself. This isn't a question\nof the state; you're not talking about the government or even just about\nthe capitalist economic apparatus< You're talking about power relations\nthat exist between individuals, between systems and individuals within\nthem, between norms and relationships and patterns of activity. All of\nthese things are what create social control. If people can come to a\ngreater understanding of how those systems operate and how change within\nthose systems can operate\u2014whether it's language or whether it's neigh-\nborhood insurrection or whatever you're talking about\u2014then that\u2079s a pol-\nitical dimension to this work which I think is going to be undercut (and\nthis is I think the sad part)...will be undercut by demanding the work to\ntake on a more obvious or visible political content. Because what hap-\npens there is that the people who are touted generally as being so-call-\ned political writers or political poets tend to be ones that take for\ngranted those larger systems and structures which language operates.\n\nThey do make certain points, but too often the only points that get a-\ncross are the ones which can plug into this whole emphasis on customary\nexpository writing or normal semantic relationships or how things norm-\nally operate\u2014certain points which people can easily consume.\n\nSH: The classic example I think of a kind of tragedy of idealism in the\nway you are talking about is the one that occurred in Russia right after\nthe Revolution. The constructivists...\n\nBA: The futurists, the dreamers of progress. They had the dream and\nthey saw some of it fulfilled and things did change....\n\n\nCB: The recent show of 'The Russian Avant-Garde, 1910-1930' in Los\nAngeles and Washington was an incredible presentation of how significant\nthis work was, how vital the spirit of that work still is, and how dev-\nastatingly things had changed by 1930. Obviously there was a movement\nin the Soviet Union, not to go into the history of the Soviet Union,\nbut the move toward centralism and toward crushing idiosyncracies and\nso on is related to what we are talking about. Now, I think that the\npolitical issues and what is the best kind of party formation and so on\nare difficult questions, and certainly there have to be different levels\nof change, certain things that have to be sacrificed for other things.\nBut these general issues we are bringing out, of qualities of human life\n\n\nthat I think art has always explored, and I think art with a political\nperspective can continue to explore, have to do with things existing for\nthemselves and not simply as instrumentalities for something else. And\nthat's why I question the idea of what political poetry is. Poetry\nwriting by people who have a social and political commitment is the way\nI would rather put it. Because in working on writing I am interested in\ncreating things which aren't simply vehicles for something else, I'm\nnot interested in teaching someone something per se, I'm not interested\nin illustrating a point per se, I'm not interested in having anecdotes\nor any of those things per se. I'm interested in creating things that\nexist on their own, for themselves, by themselves. That's why I object\nto this issue of trying, when you write, to create a language that has\nno sense of itself, that almost tries to make you forget that there is\nany kind of language there, because it does take away from the integrity\nof the work. And I think art has always been involved with self-suf-\nfiency and non-intrumentality. What that ends up being in some strange\nway is something that is a process which is to some degree not mediated\nto as great an extent by alienation. That is to say, some bit of whole-\nness or wholesomeness that can exist in the society that we're in, that\nisn't completely permeated by the structures of alienation.\n\nBA: The demand that political writing be instrumental, I think, is some-\nthing that bothers me in the same way that the demand that writing per\nse be instrumental bothers me. That is, the sense that it's instrument-\nal to giving you this hypnotized gaze at these things that are so-called\n'out there' in the so-called 'real world' and that writing is a mere c\nreplication of that real world, that writing is not a production. What\npeople don't always see, or what I'm interested in seeing myself and\nexploring, is how the writing actually creates that world out there.\nThat it's an act of production and it's not simply an act of transcrip-\ntion of some previously constituted world that's all set up out there\nso that all we have to do is live in it. I mean, we don't just live in\nthis world. We make the world, whether we are given the power to do so\nin a really active way or not. We are following along certain patterns\nwhich constitute that world and we do that through our language, we do\nthat through our consciousness. So anything which is going to explore\nthe way in which that consciousness and that writing is in fact a pro-\nduction and therefore can be changed becomes more interesting. I mean,\nit's a historical phenomenon, it's not some fated naturalistic thing\nthat we have to take for granted like the way we take the weather for\ngranted. We're talking about how people live in society and what they\ncan produce, and that gives me greater excitement about work that pre-\nsents itself both as a production and also as .something that is self-\nsufficient, that has a presence in and of itself which is interesting,\nwhich can generate a complicated emotional impact or possibility to me\n\n\nas a reader, on other people who would read the work, rathier than the\nimpact simply being generated by the hypnosis of looking at some out-\nside world that's previously constituted. Or rather than the possibil-\nities being a stylish deduction from the existing social codes. The\nthing that's exciting is the materiality of language and the partial\nself-sufficiency and partial outreach of language right there on the\npage, not this idea that you're essentially asleep while you're reading\nand being propelled into some nether world off the page where all the\naction is.\n\nCB: It's in that sense that I think writing can be an important episte-\nmological investigation, because the objects, what makes up the objects\nof the world that people talk about\u2014tables, chairs, bosses, work places,\ngeographical locations\u2014 are not things one takes for granted when one\nis writing. Those are things that one calls into question, one sees\nhow they are made up and how they are constituted, how the world is ac-\ntually divided and created constantly by the langauge that we use. By\nthe sentence structure that we use. And that to simply make syntax a\nnon-existent (that is, already determined) structure is to accept the\nobjects of the world as constituted by the mediay>bythe school systems,\nby the general ideology that is most prevalent. There certainly is a\nlot of truth to the reality of the world as we normally preceive it,\nbut those objects are not the absolutes of reality. They are constant-\nly constituted in language and by language and through language,\nconditioned by language, and it's in that sense that writing which\ndoesn't take for granted that it is describing things clearly but rather\nthat is interested in density and opacity\u2014which is certainly something\nthat would strike readers of our magazine, that this stuff isn't 'clear',\nI don't know what you are talking about, it seems fuzzy or non-expository\nor like the poetry which is dense and opaque. That's where that comes\nout of, it's that interest in not accepting the objects of the world as\ngiven."},{"uid":"CharlesBernsteinandBruceAndrews_ThePoliticsofPoetry_1979","author":"Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews","shortTitle":"The Politics of Poetry","title":"Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews | The Politics of Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/001.html","text":"\nTHE POLITICS OF POETRY\n\n\n\n(This double issue began with the desire to focus attention on political\ndimensions of current writing.

As one goes forth one is weighed\n  in the balance and if found wanting he is quietly dropped by refined\n  and cultured people, and nearly always he is left wondering why with\n  his diamonds and his motors and his money he yet cannot find entree\n  into the inner circles. An honest heart may beat beneath the ragged\n  coat, a brilliant intellect may rise above the bright checkered suit\n  and yellow tie, the man in the shabby suit may be a famous writer, the\n  woman in the untidy blouse may be an artist of great promise, but as a\n  general rule the chances are against it and such people are dull, flat,\n  stale and unprofitable both to themselves and to other people. In the\n  end, coherence is always a quality of thought rather than a manner of\n  expression. The confused mind cannot produce coherent prose. A well-\n  proportioned letter is the product of well-balanced mind. The utterance\n  of the single word \"Charles!\" may signify: \"Hello, Charles! are you\n  here? I am surprised to see you.\" Language, however, is not confined\n  to the utterance of single words. To express our thoughts we must put\n  words together in accordance with certain fixed rules. Otherwise we\n  should fail to express ourselves clearly and acceptably, and we may\n  even succeed in saying the opposite of what we mean. Since language is\n  the expression of thought, the rules of grammar agree, in the main,\n  with the laws of thought. Even in matters of divided usage, it is\n  seldom difficult to determine which of two forms is preferred by care-\n  ful writers. Everything is taken care of in the most orderly fashion:\n  terms are defined, possible ambiguities eliminated, implications and\n  assumptions explained, proofs adduced, and examples provided. On the\n  whole it is safe for the writer to leave semantic theory unexplored.\n\n  We favor the standards of the more precise stylists if only because we\n  cannot be more permissive without risking their disapproval, whereas\n  those who do not object to less exacting usage are not likely to be\n  offended by the correct usage. A good expository sentence does not\n  call attention to itself, although Strunk comments that an occasional\n  loose sentence has its virtues. No one who speaks and writes can\n  expect his audience to respond to connotations that arise from his own\n  purely personal experience. Some people associate colors with numbers,\n  but orange is not a connotation of \"four\". The trouble with Humpty\n  Dumpty\u2019s stipulative definitions, if they can be dignified by such a\n  word, is that they are entirely capricious and absurd. For sentences\n  must measure up to standards: it is always fair to ask of a sentence,\n  \"How good is it\"? Among the qualities that contribute to an effective\n\n\n  impression, the five most essential are clearness, correctness, concise-\n  ness, courtesy, and character. For style is ingratiation; negative\n  ideas, as a rule, should not be developed at length. And constructions\n  to be shunned include those that are vague, abstract, equivocal,\n  slanted, misleading, exaggerated, understated, loose, abbreviated,\n  oversimplified, obvious, irrelevant, oblique, figurative, redundant,\n  empty, impossible, or obscure. It would be a curious state of affairs\n  if only those who seldom think about the words they use, who read\n  little and who \"cannot be bothered\" with distinctions should be the\n  only ones with full powers over vocabulary and syntax. Even on the\n  grounds of free democratic choice the hands-off attitude about language\n  receives no support. These assumptions further suggest that the desire\n  for correctness, the very idea of better or worse in speech, is a\n  hangover from aristocratic and oppressive times. ...the young\n  foreigner who apologizes for the fact that the chocolates he has bought\n  as a gift are molten is told with a smile that that is not English:\n  the right word is melted. \u2014We talk to our fellows in the phrases we\n  learn from them, which seem to mean less and less as they grow worn\n  with use. The quiet cynicism of our everyday demeanor is open and\n  shameless, we callously anticipate objections founded on the well-known\n  vacuity of our seeming emotions, and assure our friends that we are\n  \"truly\" grieved or \"sincerely\" rejoiced at their hap\u2014as if joy or\n  grief that really exists were some rare and precious brand of joy or\n  grief. A sentence says you know what I mean, dear do I well I guess I\n  do. Grammar does not mean that they are to limit themselves. More\n  and more grammar is not a thing. Grammar does not make me hesitate\n  about prepositions. I am a grammarian I do not hesitate I rearrange\n  prepositions.\n\n  (Sources include Follett\u2019s Modern American Usage, Kittridge\u2019s Advanced\n  English Grammar, Stein\u2019s How to Write, Modern Language Association\u2019s\n  In-House Style Sheet, Hagar\u2019s the English of Business, Martin and\n  Ohmann\u2019s Logic and Rhetoric of Exposition, Raleigh\u2019s Style, and Eich-\n  ler\u2019s Book of Etiquette.)\n\n                               CHARLES BERNSTEIN & SUSAN B.

Charles Bernstein\u2019s essay just above in this issue on \"The\nDollar Value of Poetry\" reminds us of this. \"Social force,\" Bernstein says\nciting Simone Weil, \"is bound to be accompanied by lies.\" Poetry then can\nrefuse to be in the service of capitalism by being \"untranslatable,\" \"un-\nparaphrasable.\" In a commodity society, we might say, poetry can refuse\nan exchange-value to make itself available as use-value, or to use another\nterm, text (-uality). Recent trends in poetry can be described as the\nattempt to deny this commodity aspect of language.\n\nHow far should we go in this project? The question is not simple. It\nimplies that the project is historically conditioned, and developmental,\n\n\nand that at a certain point it will have to be thought through again when\nobjective conditions change. In the last analysis the reciprocity between\nwhat writing is and what it ought to be becomes a question of what writing\nactually does, that is, politics. To judge from a plurality of practices\nlike that of this magazine, the imperative to formulate writing questions\npolitically is recognized more and more widely\u2014and what is more important,\nby poets themselves. To place ourselves in this discussion then in the\nlast analysis seems to be to ask how writing can relate to revolution,\nthat is, class and liberal struggles. But not in any simplistic way.\n\nWhat is at stake here is the ability to give full play to the two poles of\ninstrumentality and self-referentiality. Until the present, though, it\nhas been generally assumed that it is the second of these poles, the self-\nreferential aspect of language, that ought to give writing its self-nature\nand legitimacy for others.\n\nBut it is hard to imagine how this question, phrased in just such a way,\ncan avoid having an eternal, once-and-for-all aspect to it. Posing the\nquestion in this way one doesn\u2019t so easily arrive at history. If indeed a\nutopian content were the only criterion of what a useful and acceptable\nwriting has been or continues to be, finding writing that didn\u2019t embody\nthat criterion would become a difficulty interesting only to the most\nincurable of scholastics....\n\n     But perhaps we can sharpen this question by rephrasing it. Is it\npossible to imagine a modernism that doesn\u2019t assimilate itself into the\nproject of symptomatic reading? That is to say, into a humanism. But\nwhat about struggle then? Taking sides? Being parti pris? Or are these\nconcerns out of date in our formalist era? Of course one assumes they are\nnot. But if they are not, it\u2019s hard to see how they wouldn\u2019t be instru-\nmental concerns. If all literature expresses and embodies a yearning for\na non-alienated future, it isn\u2019t clear in the balance how aspirations for\nparticipatory writerliness \u2014 a readerly praxis \u2014 do not end as subjective\nimprovements that may become indispensable to reaction itself. This possi-\nbility poses a useful limit case. For it once more foregrounds the poli-\ntical .\n\n     Literary history is in a sense the enumeration of past consensuses of\nthis problem that are no longer seen as viable. Romanticism and the cult\nof the artist. Symbolism and alienated utopia. Modernism and the feti-\nshization of language as product. Described in this way, however, the\ntrajectory is one that grows increasingly melancholy. In each of these\nstages literature has more and more radically narrowed its rights to the\npublic participation in the ongoing construction of society by itself \u2014\ninseparable from power. A profound disjunction, that has proved favorable\nneither to power nor to literature. Yet both continue to influence each\nother, fascinate each other, and their uneasy attractiveness seems to\nregister the uneven development of revolution itself. This specific in-\nability to think writing and power at one and the same time then comes to\nhave a name. It is false consciousness.\n\n\n2.   So perhaps we can start again and understand writing, poetry, as\ndeveloped in our time as a critique of power. Such a critique\u2014a deni-\ngration or disavowal\u2014 can now be usefully described and evaluated from a\npolitical-historical perspective. The refusal of the moment of power in\nthe transition stage to socialism becomes objectively regressive or even\nreactionary as the refusal of contestation. Simultaneously, though, this\nrefusal names the utopian content of a later period. But in the transition\nto this later time\u2014communism\u2014 the critique of power takes on a positive\nmeaning and no longer functions regressively. It becomes instead the\nmeans of expediting a passing over to the era of history proper, to the\ndismantling of the state and its apparatuses and to the first general\nrealization of a human social life. The legitimacy of writing as a cri-\ntique of power then stands or fails in relation to its historical timeli-\nness in utopian struggles. In periods when legitimate demands are given\nutopian formulations, the anti-instrumental character of this kind of\nwriting gives it a definite progressive function. In an era of class\nstruggle, however, when political demands take on an instrumental complex-\nion, such a writing may come to seem less useful. At this point writing\nmay often become propaganda. Such at least has been the classical and\nbinary model. Yet there are strong indications from our own time that the\nmodel has been broken down and that these either-or formulations have been\nsimply bypassed.\n\n     This is the dilemma. Modernism\u2019s alliance with terrorism and dis-\norder has become irrelevant precisely to the extent that communistic or\nutopian possibilities have begun to make their presence felt in collective,\ndurable political formulations in objective association with the working\nclass. And to the degree that these new utopian forces make themselves\nfelt politically, writing is to that extent forced to rethink its abdica-\ntion from power. By a consensual removal of itself to the margins of the\npublic sphere of commodity production\u2014in order to privilege utopian\ndemands for use-value \u2014 writing historically founded its notion of self-\nlegitimacy on a reintegration in the communist future. But what if in a\nvariety of regions and in germinal form that future has already begun to\nmake its appearance in the advanced capitalist countries in the West?\n\n3.   All this of course is to speak once more of the cultural revolution,\nand to ask again if any legacy remains 10 years after Maoism, May of \u201968\nin Paris, the anti-war days of the \u201960s and Counterculture, and the Prague\nSpring....\n\n     What has happened? In 10 years objectively anarcho-communist forms\nof political organization have sprung up and proliferated wherever one\nlooks. Feminism and the gay movement, ecology and anti-nuclear movements\u2014\nin Europe and in this country both\u2014power issues on a municipal level,\nconsumers\u2019 and tenants\u2019 movements, the large-scale prison movement and so\non\u2014a whole spectrum of liberation organizations has now arisen. Their\nimpact has been to raise issues in mass political organizations, such that\n\n\ntheir solution is not possible within a program advancing a demand for\nsocialism alone, but only on the basis of one making radical demands\nbeyond that\u2014 to communism, in fact.\n\n     Within this perspective one might legitimately ask if the solution\nof writing and writers can still remain what it has been programmatically\u2014\nthat is, a political absence validated by the notion of a critique of\npower in an autonomous writing area. Early in the 19th Century this was\nthe concordat reached between writing and society, an agreement according\nto which society\u2019s writing practice was from then on to seem something\nother than self-expression. But if this agreement is now seen as renego-\ntiable, we will need another conceptual model in order to do it. For\nwriting\u2019s renunciation of instrumental values in regard to language will\ncontinue to imply the negation of an attempt at power as long as writing\nand power are seen in a relation of mutual exclusivity. If, in other\nwords, writing must always be either on the side of utopia or on the side\nof instrumentality. And if \u2014 more radically\u2014class and liberation strug-\ngles are to persist in regarding each other with stares of non-recognition.\nIn this case surely writing would remain exterior to power, and power to\nwriting. But what if the situation were to change? What if at a certain\npoint in history, class struggle were to begin to have a doubly implica-\nting relationship with human liberation struggle? And what if human his-\ntory had begun to think socialism and communism gtobal\/Ly and at the same\ntime! \u2014 and here the work of Rudolf Bahro might be seen as a dramatic\nindicator of these very possibilities. If one were to be able to think the\nsituation in some such way as this, one could also conceive of the possi-\nbility of some collective intellectual work existing on its own behalf.\nRather than instrumentality for another, writing\u2019s relation to power would\nthen be self-expression. This new model would have profound implications\nfor the norms and forms of writing as now practiced. For writing\u2019s\n\u2019eternal\u2019, or unreflected, premise has been that the notion of writing for\nanother and that of writing as a commodity are in reality one and the same\nthing\u2014an understanding that has made modernism possible. But let us\nsuppose for a moment that the situation has changed. Let us suppose that\nthis binary description is no longer adequate to the course of events.\nWriting now grounds itself in an interior relation to power. It becomes a\nself-expression, and a group practice. With this supposition writing\u2019s\npast is simply the series of discrete moments, salvageable enclaves or\ntestimonials to what is still to come. Its present on the other hand be-\ncomes the collective intellectual practice one is engaged in at any moment.\nWriting would not be separate from whatever one does as an intellectual \u2014\nin the body of those who both think and act, and who stand in a certain\ntendential, final relation to the Modern Prince. That is how this reality\nmight be mapped in the present. And here one can already see certain\npoints of possible focus. These are probably very ordinary or predictable\nareas like work in mass or sectarian organizations, critical and educa-\ntional outputs, the construction of political narrations or what-have-you.\n\n\nIn all this play would be supposed. This writing would be instrumental in\na new way, certainly, but never in a sense that didn\u2019t say \u2019we,\u2019 that\nwasn\u2019t freely willed. It probably wouldn\u2019t get along with commissars.\n\n     Naturally one supposes that this writing has begun and tha*\" it is\nonly a question of locating it \u2014 and that each can begin finding it in her\nlife or his. It is impossible to assume that this writing has not already\nbegun in places one visits each day. Writers, in this view, are simply\npeople engaged in reaching, political organization, community work and\nliberation groups, and so on\u2014 in fact in normal activities we are already\nengaged in. This is the opposite of modernism and \u00e9criture. Above all,\na writing like the one I am supposing accepts its relation to power. It\nknows it has no other choice. But in this it feels tremendously exuberant\nat the thought of the possibilities opening before it. And it knows too,\nit is embarked.\n\n"},{"uid":"BruceBoone_WritingsCurrentImpasseandthePossibilitiesforRenewal_1982","author":"Bruce Boone","shortTitle":"Writing's Current Impasse and the Possibilities for Renewal","title":"Bruce Boone | Writing's Current Impasse and the Possibilities for Renewal | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1982","date":1982,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":4.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEvol4\/pictures\/062.html","text":"\n                Writing's Current Impasse and the Possibilities for Renewal\n\n\n\n\n            Bruce Boone\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast with the socially conscious writers of the 30s, many of us who are left or left oriented\nwriters today see ourselves as historically advantaged. We make comparisons and assume we've\nbenefited. Current attitudes suppose that our marxism is 'objective', while theirs was a kind of belief,\nquasi-religious in tone. Yet it remains an odd situation when left writers do not see a kinship with\nother left writers who preceded them. It's more than likely that our rejection of this earlier age is\nmade possible by a symmetrical ignorance of ours, a reluctance to challenge our own assumptions\nabout writing and thinking, our own belief systems. We acknowledge the political activity of that\nearlier age willingly enough, but we're less generous when it comes to their writing style \u2014 a crude\nliterary Stalinism, we suppose. From Granville Hicks and the middle-class Communists or fellow\ntravelling highbrow critics to Mike Gold and the John Reed proletarians, most of the left writers of\nthat time seem uncomfortably tainted with the serious political errors of 'illusionism,' 'psychology'\nand 'reductionism.' Sartre himself in the late 40s would condemn socialist realism for these same\nqualities \u2014 while making sure to acknowledge the need for commitment. But these literary\nassumptions may need a re-examination at a new level. As we begin the 80s, there are indications that\nsomething has gone wrong for us and that the left modernism of the last decade has painted itself\ninto an increasingly constricted, academic corner, from which it has yet to emerge with any new\nclaims to relevancy.\n\n         Many of the dominant ideas about what writing should be stem from Sartre\u2019s old opponent,\nRoland Barthes \u2014 received ideas about writerly autonomy, textuality and the values of pleasure for\ninstance. It's important to note this source since a context is provided in this way historically. Such a\ngenealogy can begin to lay the problem out, and we can see what these principles once stood for.\nWhat was at issue then \u2014 in the structuralist debates \u2014 was the basic explanatory power of historical\nthought. Especially in the exciting and pace-setting sciences of anthropology and linguistics there\nwere growing indications that the human or social sciences would have to jettison their traditional\ncausalist pre-suppositions and assumptions just as surely as physics and the physical sciences had\ndone. As the awareness of these developments reached the literary arena, it was clear that here too\nassumptions were being made that would have to be challenged. At the center of the controversy \u2014\narguing against Sartre's dictation of a committed or goal-oriented literature \u2014 was Roland Barthes.\nLiterary assumptions changed, and Barthes became de facto leader of the new structuralist theory and\npractice. Under Barthes' influence, writers began criticizing their collective past. Structuralism\nshowed how the links between any historical past and our ways of thinking about that past are\n\n\ntenuous at best or non-existent. All this was applied to literature. Perhaps the past was even a kind of\nprojection we made from our own standpoint; but if so a committed writing became problematic in\nthe extreme. Writing had to assume these connections in order to be politically and morally effective\n\u2014 so that now the whole edifice of an engaged writing was seriously called into question. It appeared\nthat events could act as witnesses only afterwards, when they could be called to the stand and asked\nto give narratives, tell stories. From this new way of thinking a new writing practice developed, one\nthat accented language values in literature and writing's pleasure aspect, one that devalued writing's\npurposefulness. This is the writing we know as ours. In it writing's previous goal-orientation is fully\ncancelled and writing accepts itself as a production of micro-occurrences and short-term destinies.\n\n         The reasons for this are not difficult to understand. No one loves a bureaucracy any more,\nand writing a proletarian novel these days would in many ways be the equivalent of joining a sect.\nFor many socialists the writerly scandal of bureaucratic deformations involves events that cannot be\ndismissed without discussion \u2014 Czechoslovakia, Cambodia, Afghanistan and so on. These events\nhave called into question the bureaucratic stage of socialism; they imply the need to rethink marxism\nin the direction of democracy. For left writers now there is, as a result, a growing intuition that the\nsearch for a new writing must unquestionably include feminism, democracy and the acceptance of\nthe erotic as basic assumptions, without which a left writing project would inevitably fail. Left writing\ntoday, it appears, must not simply further socialism, but must also criticize power, and if possible do\nboth together. To the extent it succeeds, it registers a gain, becoming necessarily anti-authoritarian,\npleasure-loving and non-dismissive. So doing, writing mirrors the era. It advances to an historical\nstage and in an historical direction of some promise.\n\n         But a left writing of this description has failed to materialize. It remains what ought to have\nbeen attempted rather than what really was tried. Instead of both criticizing power and furthering\nsocialism, the writing which did eventuate from the late 60s \u2014 our writing \u2014 has concerned itself\nfar more with the critique of power than with an advocacy of socialism \u2014 bracketed as too\n'thematic,' concerned with content. As a result, our left writing of the 70s has had its characteristic\ndeformation. It has become 'textual' at the price of abandoning any specific political tasks. As\ntechniques of randomness have come to characterize this writing project, its social functions are no\nlonger clear. In its intent our writing of course remains transformative, but in its practice it has\nbecome \u2014 alas! \u2014 integrative. Our project's self-definition of itself as science has cut it off from any\nreal and public feeling life. It's doubtful whether left modernist writing can be called \u2018left' any more.\nBut shouldn't this be a cause for dismay \u2014 perhaps even alarm? For if our writing is no longer to\nhave social effects, why do we write? These questions are urgent ones, I think. They involve\nunderstanding our origins first of all. They also involve understanding our current situation in\npolitics and society.\n\n\n         How did the left modernist project first begin \u2014 and what were its goals? A beginning in the\ndiscussion might well involve a more frank assessment of modernism\u2019s relation to the Bolshevik\nRevolution. It ought to be candidly noted that modernism's ties with Revolution seem closer\nretrospectively than was the case at the time. If there was an alliance involved, it was more with\nanarchist, experimentalist and workerist trends than with more orthodox statist and Leninist currents.\nOn any balance sheet of the modernist movement, it is true, we would have to note modernism's\ncharacteristic anti-capitalism \u2014 but in some way qualify it too. For the question of modernism\u2019s ties\nwith fascism in other countries remains a sign of its unequal development. Certainly the various\nmodernisms took their several paths, from futurism in Italy to vorticism in England to formalism in\nRussia and the young USSR etc. In its last development modernism has become a writing practice\nfamiliar to us in our own time and country as a deconstructive practice, a systematic attempt to\ndemystify and come to terms with language as a commodity force. This is the variant that is now the\nkoine of left writing. As a trajectory, it has shape and curve \u2014 and we can describe it. It is a writing\nthat has historically stood in opposition to the alienation and exploitation of human and language\nresources by the modern state. It can be described as anti-capitalist but not always in a benign sense,\ngiven its sometime fascist connections. Above all the modernist protest and project has been\nstructurally anti-bureaucratic; its most typifying demand has been for a return of basic emotions and\nperceptions to a grounding in human experience and an attack on statist substitutes for this in\ndeformed language and in the extension of the control mechanisms of industrial discipline into\nbroader currents of social life. For modernism, Bolshevism \u2014 and sometimes Fascism \u2014 seemed in\nthis sense \u2018anti-capitalist.\u2019 Both denounced the alienation of previously untouched areas of social life\nby bureaucracies with totalizing goals. But in this development modernism\u2019s links with the working\nclass have been tenuous. So that modernism \u2014 even in its left modernist, committed variant \u2014 has\nremained basically utopian in character \u2014 an expression of hopes, a collection of protests and\ndocumentation of spiritual distress in capitalist times rather than a program for meeting needs,\nexpressing the demand for social change.\n\n         But it's appropriate to think of a modernism that might be more successful. One with\nperhaps a more genuinely popular character. We might think of a modernism with community and\ncollective dimensions for instance. Might this not be a modernism too? \u2014 only one perhaps more\nreadily adapted to social struggle. The determinant element in this might well be the intensive effort\nto give the forms and codes of community and collective life a transformative shape with topical or\nlocal signification \u2014 with thematic 'content' in other words.\n\n         As an aspiration of course the idea, as applied to modernism, wouldn't exactly be new; and\nits roots certainly would go back to the 30s in our country. For what was critical for large scale left\nwriting practice then \u2014 irrespective of how inept or unrealized \u2014 was the effort to give precisely this\ntransformative character to group speech at every level, from broad-based community codes to the\n\n\nsophisticated, technical codes of the intelligentsia. The writer's basic connection had in some way to\nbe with group life. Naturally the reasons for this varied. But for nearly a decade writing in the United\nStates was colored in some way or other by this basic orientation. And in this sense the left writers'\nmovement was much closer in spirit to Russian modernism than the original modernism was to the\nsocialist realist movement that followed it. In spite of organizational or Party ties not even the crudest\nof the American writers (Gold would be a good example) were ever bureaucrats in any literal sense.\nBut that of course is exactly what the Soviet writers were. In America \u2014 unless you were the editor of\nthe New Masses \u2014 you weren't on anyone's payroll and you didn't stand to benefit from any\nadvantages that might accrue to you from a State. Soviet writers by contrast might hope not only for\nrewards but for advancement \u2014 into an apparatus, etc. The reasons of opportunism for a writer's\nassociation with the Communist movement in this country were slight or non-existent. Not that\nthere wouldn't be neurotic or other rather unattractive reasons instead. But by and large and\nhistorically in the American left writers of this period there was a compelling aspiration, a real need to\nrelate to the group life of the times. And at least for a short time during our literary history that need\noften superceded personal ones.\n\n         The drawbacks of the period remain drawbacks of course \u2014 and needn't be rehearsed again.\nThere are on the other hand definite lessons to be learned from these literary predecessors.\nPreeminent among them is the practical lesson. Inside the Party or alongside it the intellectuals and\nwriters of the time quite simply had to learn certain organizational skills or would have been of no\nuse in advancing the causes and social movements they chose to support \u2014 and they very quickly did\nlearn these skills. They propagandized and polemicized. They formed commissions and investigated.\nThey attended congresses, they issued reports. This activity set the tone for an era. What practically\nresulted was an increase in a mass awareness that society was divided along class lines and \u2014 a bit\nlater \u2014 a more urgent consciousness of the need for a 'United Front' against Fascism. Many writers\nparticipated in these struggles only briefly \u2014 and with real contradictions and misunderstandings \u2014\nbut what they gained for themselves, for however short the period, was a relation to the life of\nordinary people, their deepest hopes and aspirations, to the large American society from which\nhistorically they had excluded themselves. For the first time \u2014 if there were precedents they were\nweak or half-forgotten \u2014 American writers were in a real, not a factitious relation to the masses of\ntheir fellow Americans. Writers had come to be in good faith and were once again part of society.\nThis one overriding fact must have meant a great deal. To judge from the plethora of memoirs from\nthis period, when writers wrote with social goals at the time they felt themselves alive, many of them,\nfor the first time. I think it would be difficult to overestimate this feeling. To the extent that left\nmodernism of today feels itself discouraged, academic or tangential to current life, it must to this\nsame degree stand in marked contrast to that earlier time. A relation to life is all-important for\n\n\nwriting. The writing of the 30s for that reason has valuable lessons for us \u2014 as we begin with some\nconfusion to face the 80s.\n\n        Now it is not altogether true that our own period remains ignorant of the problem, and\ncertain trends in left modernism have begun gradually to recognize the existence of this critique. This\nhas come about mainly through feminism and gay writing \u2014 as writing that 'criticizes power' as well\nas contains expressive political dimensions. Thus in some segments of the modernist movement\nbiographical and autobiographical modes of writing now seem interesting \u2014 but in an abstract way.\nEven textual writing has itself begun to gravitate toward biography, narrative even. Again, there is the\nspecial place for criticism in left modernism. Here we can see politics appearing, surprisingly, as\ntheme \u2014 that is, a technical discourse of specialists lending the text a certain worldly cachet. These\ncorrectives unfortunately are hardly radical. They allude to social life but do not express it, and their\npolitics remain abstract.\n\n        Though there are certainly qualifications and reservations to be made, the earlier aspirations\nof left writers for a relation to social life once more makes the need for \u2018Americanism\u2019 in our current\nwriting goals not only thinkable, but desirable. The writing of the 30s becomes a paradigm. This is\ntrue whether the left writers in question were \u2018proletarian\u2019 or \u2018middle class\u2019 in their backgrounds, and\nit becomes critical as the decade wears on. After the so-called Third Period of Communism (1928-\n1935), the restricted and aggressive marxism of the post-Lenin years gave way to the broader,\nalliance-minded United Front era (1935-I939). Shortly after the 7th Congress of the Communist\nInternational, the American Party began to open its doors to popular, Americanist and radical\ncurrents \u2014 and in not too selective a fashion. Intellectuals and middle-class writers now associated\nthemselves with what seemed in many ways the leading movement of the times, a progressive\nmovement that fought for the rights of workers, expressed the yearning of most Americans for a\nbetter national life and \u2014 perhaps most important of all \u2014 led the anti-Fascist struggle, at least until\nthe Hitler-Stalin pact.\n\n        In time, however, the Party's Americanism became dubious or discredited. After all, how far\ncould one go? Granville Hicks' 1938 I Like America \u2014 written while Hicks was still in the Party and\npresumably expressive of the Party line \u2014 brought the uncomfortable problem of patriotism to the\nfore. It remained for Earl Browder, the Party's General Secretary, to take the line to its logical \u2014 but\nstill surprising \u2014 conclusion. 'Communism is Twentieth Century Americanism,\u2019 Browder had\nannounced, and in 1944 at Browder's urging the Party was dissolved, to become the 'Communist\nPolitical Association.' Two years after, Browder was read out of the Party, after publication of the\nDuclos Letter. But the damage was done. The Party's revisionism brought it and the Left with it into\na troublesome disrespect. As the New Left was later to wonder \u2014 in the 60s and 70s \u2014 to what\nextent is the Party, as historical representative of the American left, still to be considered\nrevolutionary? To what extent is this a result of a turn toward 'Americanism' ' or populism?\n\n\n         But the limits of Americanism were revealed in writing as well. Additionally, the\nimplications of the Moscow Trials and other unsavory aspects of Russian statism were beginning to\nmake themselves felt. Writers began to leave the Party in droves, fellow travellers retreated once more\nto their private concerns. Many even ended as anti-Communists \u2014 John Dos Passos, Howard Fast\nand others. Others still, the Trotskyist sympathizers like Edmund Wilson and the Partisan Review\ngroup, were to become the Liberals of the Cold War years. Objectively these desertions from the\nCommunist movement may be justified; yet the phenomenon remains a disturbing one -in spite of\nthe Stalinism and revisionism which may have been its enabling cause. The swing toward\nAmericanism on the part of the writers of this period was important as a corrective against the\nformalist currents which had preceded it. As the Communist influence on national life began to ebb,\nthese writers followed suit, retrenched and took up their mostly private concerns. From the vantage\npoint of our time it's difficult not to conclude that the ideals to which these writers had committed\nthemselves were in some way inadequate from the beginning. Their ideals were not just Americanist\n\u2014 but Stalinist and authoritarian as well.\n\n         A fair review of the literature of the time can hardly avoid the observation that it was, in fact,\nthrough and through authoritarian, sexist in its implications and blatantly homophobic. This is, in\naddition, not an unfair critique of the Left to which it was allied. The problem of the writing of the\nperiod may even be seen, for simplicity's sake, as the problem of the CP in this period. Like the\nParty, writers felt themselves in a sort of double relation to the masses. They were part of this large\ngrouping and expressed it, but they were also above it, leading. And to the degree that they became\nthe 'leaders' of the writing movement of their day, these writers, like the Party 'leading elements' '\nwere drawn to authoritarian satisfactions. In the absence of objective self-interest in allying\nthemselves with the Socialist movement \u2014 and writers and other middle-class intellectuals were\nnotorious for joining the movement for reasons of idealism or self-sacrificing humanitarianism \u2014 it\nwould have been difficult or impossible not to have expected these writers to compensate for real\nconsiderations with some concessions to pretense or bullying. Or this could become something like\npedantry. 'Oh, we could preach sermons on Sunday,' Earl Browder remarked of writers allied with\nthe Party, 'but for the intellectuals every day was Sunday.' But in a sense this was natural. For these\nintellectuals and middle-class writers lacked any organic connection between the collective interests of\ntheir own and working class interests. But questions as to whether this situation might have been\notherwise are probably speculative. The period was what it was.\n\n         The important exception was the United Front, which Dimitroff had proclaimed at the\nSeventh Congress. In this struggle against the terrible new movement of Germany, Italy and\nelsewhere, there was a great deal of self-interest for writers. They had direct \u2014 visceral \u2014 reasons for\nstruggling against this movement, and every day the reasons became clearer. With an awareness of\nevents then taking place in Germany and elsewhere intellectuals instinctively knew that a successful\n\n\nFascism would make the continuation of their pursuit of a life choice as intellectuals or writers\ndifficult if not impossible. Their choice of themselves and Fascism, they realized, were mutually self-\nexclusive. Additionally, many of these same intellectuals and writers were Jewish. And on that\u2019s core\nclearly they had if possible still more urgent reasons for combating Fascism and allying themselves\nwith a Communist-led United Front. Here at last was an organic relation to the progressive\nmovement on the part of intellectuals and writers. With a United Front politic, motivations of guilt,\nself-sacrifice and so on were temporarily suspended. There was no need for such motivations. As a\nwriter you were fighting in your own interest.\n\n         This \u2018organic\u2019 exception to the typically idealist relation of writers to the left movement of\nthe 30s gives us a clue, I believe, to the re-evaluation of the period for our own purposes. Left writing\nin that time can be said to have been successful to the extent that it had organic \u2014 rather than\nidealistic \u2014 relations with the left movement as a whole. Empathy is not, and was not, enough. As an\nintellectual or writer you have to speak as a leftist from that viewpoint, from the viewpoint of the\nintellectual and writer. Otherwise the characteristic faults of your writing are likely to be those that\ntypify the left writing of the 30s \u2014 a too frequent pedantry, moralism or authoritarianism.\n\n         The left writing of our own period ought to question what its own best interests are. If it\ndoes so, it may well see that its intellectuals have a continuing interest in the critique of power. That\nstruggle of course will still target language commodification as its special enemy. But aren't our\ninterests wider here than we have suspected? The fight against language alienation, it appears, is only\na part of the story, one instance among many in the ongoing fight against the relations of\nsubalternity.\n\n"},{"uid":"DavidBromige_Coolidge_1980","author":"David Bromige","shortTitle":"Coolidge","title":"David Bromige | Coolidge | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn12\/pictures\/015.html","text":"\nCOOLIDGE\n\n\nCLARK COOLIDGE, WEATHERS\n\nWhat he takes from Olson is not the Hey-you-guys-set-out-to-sea-in-the-\nleaky-yawl-I-have-provided but the I-want-to-get-Gravelly-Hill-into-a\npoem\/diorite-stoney\/the-secret-I-can\u2019t-speak-is-dark-in-here Olson.

This is Black Mtn projec-\ntion, the individual writ big, Specter-of-the-Brocken writing, Kerouac he\nmuch admires : CC wants to write his life. Any attempt to go by earlier\nmodels for how to do that would never be \"my\" life, which, as all might\nknow, since it\u2019s fact, is composition of thwarted desire with misdirected\nintention come right.

How much of writing knocks life out of\nthe accidental, orders things to make them reasonable! Because my name\nhad to appear in the reports of our games (625 words max.) I wrote for\nThe Kilburn Times, these were signed \"D.

But nature favors my right foot; curiously, since I\u2019m left-\nhanded. Which is why I have trouble with knots. Killing the ball with\nmy right foot, I stood looking down at the almost perfect sphere,\nadmiring once more its handsome paneling. Oh dear! My shoe-strings were\nuntied. My teammates were shouting, urging me to a decision. Soldofsky\nwas creeping forward, obscuring my range. I let fly with my right foot\n(by what miracle of the will brought to action? by what bootstraps\nself-raised?), but my left foot was standing on the lace of my right\nboot. As I fell, my left foot knocked against the ball & the rest is\nhistory. I couldn\u2019t have done it alone. Well, you couldn\u2019t say all\nthis in The Kilburn Times.

Did I say, we didn\u2019t even have regular goalposts, sometimes?\nIn the match with Neasden, two piles of coats marked the horizontal\nlimits of the goal; it was up to the referee whether the shot was low\nenough to have passed under the imaginary crossbar. Two minutes from\nthe end, we were losing 3-4. Is narrative bourgeois fantasy? A mirror,\nthe only true Protestant relic? Ron Silliman, a confessional poet? Did\nTristan\u2019s shot pass beneath the non-existent bar?

They were sometimes useful,\nespecially the metal straps and hasps, bendable in the big vise, with\neffort.

They were not citizens or politics. It is more\nthat the large space could be used, walked into as a unity, like a\ncountry not thinking of its restaurants. One could, though one never\ndid, greet the space. It could be acknowledged, in a different way from\nhow, turning out a jar of washers or fitments, the pieces not useful\nwould still be greeted or given a value while picked through or around\nand set aside.\n\n    Max Picard says if words didn\u2019t go out of themselves to refresh them-\nselves in things, they would hang around in heaps and impede our move-\nments, like things in a warehouse. That may be an argument for reference.\nOne could prefer the warehouse, as one dreams in a surplus-parts store.\nWill this be sought out or printed\u2014ever be more than browsing.

It can\neven tell you how to pretend to take it (the courteous or docile reader can even fool himself.) One\ndoes not feel reading most writing that one is creating it \u2014 you don't mistake your recognition for\nthe writer's. But he can bring you very close to his recognition of meantness, partly by techniques\nanalogous to the dancer's. The reader, in spite of his physical control of the act of reading, can\nfunction as something partway in between a s\u00e9ance medium and a puppet. Mental operations going\non in him have been determined, within parameters which take psychological differences into\naccount (letters to one friend can male that difference an element in the composition \u2014 but again\nwithin limits. Writing to yourself is even odder.) When you read well you know what the author\nmeans in the widest sense, and can even guess how he would answer some questions at least he did\nnot anticipate.\n\n        You solve the problem of other minds by reading, talking and dancing. If a cocked eyebrow\nmeans negation you find out fast. And words especially, even fixed, even thousands of years old,\nrepay contemplation when reread, to the point where subtle emendations are agreed on by scholars.\nAny important piece of writing can become familiar. An average reader may choose not to look at\none, and may mistake this for a judgment that the piece is beneath notice, insignificant. But the fact\nthat this mistake can be pointed out suggests how merely psychological it is. Even those for whom\nreading is suffering, a horror of missed opportunity, fear what they are not catching \u2014 sense that\nsomething is going on.\n\n        You can tell Stein\u2019s The World is Round is by a child of ten and grade them on how quickly\nthey see it\u2019s a lie \u2014 see, that is, that your direction is misleading, doesn\u2019t work over the long haul.\nTell them Robert Creeley\u2019s poems are written by a woman.\n\n        Writing tells you how to read it: dead ends appear as such.\n\n        Most readers who read merely for diversion are vulnerable to the dead end of reputation.\n\n        In writing, in the West, the materials matter less. But the flexing, keying up, is there. We are\nright to call bad writing slack \u2014 it's odd we don't use the word for painting.\n\n\n\n  Excerpted from Gerald Burns, Toward a Phenomenology of Written Art, 1979, Treacle Press, P.O. Box 638, New Paltz,\nN.Y. 12561; $4.95 \u00a9 1979 by Burns.\n\n\n         Slack is more than perfunctory, though perhaps contained in that term. There is a\nconceptual arm \u2014 that the artist has underestimated a difficulty.\n\n         This may be a difficulty of construction, as when Pound writes nice lines that would\npersuade you coherence has to have been achieved \u2014 that you are perceiving a whole that in fact you\naren't.\n\n         It also underestimates the medium. My type for this (aside from any page of any novel \u2014\nwould the Chinese read our novels?) is almost anyone trying to describe. There is no awe, no feeling\nthat the world would be different if it worked. It's that odd form \u2014 the artist's complacent and\npreconscious assumption that he's done it, and how this feeds into the writing and convinces the\nsocial reader that he must now pretend it has worked. This is why so many people feel unconsciously\nthat written art is somehow pretense. This is very like self-righteousness in religion.\n\n         Words say things that mean things. Not that meanings mean. Say they have sensuous\nqualities. Now, verse handbooks, say not two things but three (or three and a half): that poems have\nmeanings to engage the intellect, and sensuous qualities \u2014 but that the second of these and perhaps\nalso the first includes how the words come to us \u2014 whether we hear them or read them, say. The half\ncomes in because one may (merely may) signal while reading aloud that the words are being read, that\nbeing read matters (partly the difference, in Readings, between the poet who chants from memory\nand the one who puts on hornrims and rustles manuscript.) And read verse can mime speech-hearing.\nThen words can mime being read (or said) to others in their sound, etc., but this begins to verge on\nmeaning. Ultimately you can say all this is meaning if meaning is partly situational (grandma reading\nkids a story), and partly the subconscious though deliberate fashioning of sounds, syntax, etc. in their\norigins contingent. But the important addition is that the act of reading (or hearing) is a part of verse\nas much as 'meaning' and sound. It's harder to talk about because one tries so hard when small to do\nit automatically.\n\n         But they say that reading for information (newspapers) one is barely conscious of the\nmedium \u2014 the words in the particular language, their sounds, etc. etc., and that art-words force you\nvarious ways to consider that medium in various ways. So far so good. But writers are also readers \u2014\nwere readers first, some of them \u2014 and of course were hearers before they became readers. And the\nreaders for whom the experience of reading is an important life-event, who become writers, may tend\nto write to other readers in a different way, may do odd things so that the act (or even experience) of\nwriting will bear one of several relations to the act and experience of reading. In some poems, the fact\nthat they are read may become an acknowledged part of the total poem-event......\n\n                          It is something of a matter of sleight of hand.\n\n                          (WCW, Imaginations, p. 75)\n\n\n         Illusion is not the same as sleight of hand. A magician who used real magic would please no\nmore, theatrically speaking. It might be real magic to change the specific gravity of a gold coin by a\nfew points, but it would not be magical. Generally in art what keeps illusion less than total is the\nmedium \u2014 one might produce the temporary illusion that one's epic is wonderful, but that's another\nmatter. That a poem does more than its components is more what verse has to do with illusion,\ngetting more out than you seem to put in. In fact the writer is working hard and the reader is. But it\nseems just like reading something. It is something like the relation hunting a unicorn might have to\nhunting a deer \u2014 one makes the same motions but they become legend. Hemingway tries to make\nlegend out of hunting the deer. Now if you say, 'Every deer is a unicorn,' you are close to poetry if\nnot indeed to magic. Now for us tools are practical ugly things you do things with \u2014 they are no\nmore 'there' than the newspaper prose with respect to the information it conveys. If you are an\nIndian and the deer is spooky, a spirit or an animal with habits, the tool is part of a rite, like holy\nplate. In some cultures the tool is hardly understood as a Useful Thing. It is part of a rite which is\neffective whether it works or not. One could say that the West tries over and over to make verse\nmerely useful, merely a means \u2014 as if we want to say the unicorn is a cow. Perhaps domestication\ninvolved first of all our getting over our horror at animals. I like to think the first poetry was funny.\nArt disguised as craft, I said a while ago.\n\n         Now old-fashioned theatrical magic assumes an audience that wants unicorns. The\nmechanics of it was concerned with giving it that, the stagecraft with making sure it knew it. The\nother end of the continuum that begins with pleasant surprise at a Cup and Ball routine is horror,\nwhich has to do with moods evoked by materials \u2014 the canvas rocks of Gothic, the fact that the\ncoins are gold. And horror is a perfectly sensible way to react to the world's things and materials.\nWonder is only more polite....\n\n         Some writers know a great deal about how words should come at a reader; others study the\nways words come to a writer. The second is likely to please passionate readers more, if only because\nthe first is more likely to be vulnerable to literature as rule book, a catalogue of other men\u2019s effects.\nWhat saves him sometimes is reading very little. The second, whether reading or writing, is likely to\npay less attention to the book of rules than to grass and how the ball looks coming at you, and the\noddity of lines painted on a field. What he explores is the act of writing, as his readers explore the act\nof reading. There is nothing contemptible about traditionalist writing, but its readers are more likely\nto ignore the act of reading as part of the experience of what is read.

At last there is before us the\nultimate ambiguity between the existence of an intentionally made mark and the conceptual silence\nof the marker \u2014 a statement of being without reference to thought or style, the inarticulate cry\nreproduced, the struggle for thought in which lack of an exact word makes forming a conception an\nimpossible act. This raises the question of appropriate response: how to name circumstances or\nfeelings, interior motives, external moral or cultural urgings? Ascertaining what occurs, has occurred,\nwill occur \u2014 which is the occasion, apogee, orgasm? This partakes of the nature of childhood\u2019s\nsexuality, of intuitions of what is there, of that which may be recognized as the object of their \/ our\nlongings. This becomes the veil cast over that which, as adults, we cannot discuss with a friend, the\nintimacies we practice while forbidden, that which stirs our lovers from sleep, fondly or full of their\nown yearning.\n\n         This is that from which metaphor springs dissatisfying, penumbrous \u2014 the source silence on\noccult matters, or those of predestination, of genetics or environment \u2014 and the source of\ncircumlocution, the ambiguous alchemical directives.\n\n         Here we are caught in all that we know about literature. This is as much the source of the\nsongs of the troubadours as of the stories of the Bible as of our single speaking-voice. Here are the\nintimations that the langue d'oc might hold more experiences for us, increase the variety of our acts,\njust as mere cruelty has become sadism, though previously enjoyed unnamed, recognisably human\nwhile standing without the vocabulary. Because of this past and future of our speech, our worst\nfantasy has been lived out already by others who have a name for it, and we find ourselves shamed by\nthe paucity of our lives when we resort to the language of the clinic.

And if these are the same,\nthen will this contentlessness be sufficient to avoid the problem of esthetics, and can there be an\nabdication from form which remains a visual entity?

This may stand for what is known and repressed, for shame, for the tides of blood\nsurging towards the face or sexual organs, for individual ethics foresworn under the strain of the\npassions. And in all this the fear that intentions themselves may be read, that they have a luminosity\nall their own, that tonal differences will appear upon close scrutiny by the viewer, that some of the\nlines covering this surface will seem redder than the background with which the artist\/author will\ninsist they are identical.

This is\nthe argot of qualities painfully concealed: the prosthetic shoe, the cosmetic surgery, the unfashionable\nracial origins, the homosexuals expelled after their part in the revolution is over. This is the latin\nquarter in which our parents were raised but do not live.\n\n         This is the dictionary of dead languages: here are the many words for stone-cutting tools, for\nwhat other languages dismiss as tiny hesitations of climatic change, the single word for sheep heavily-\npregnant and suckling newborn lambs. Here are the expansions and contractions of a vocabulary, like\nours, shaped by the necessity to instruct, by unfamiliar labor conditions, by the hidden dangers most\nfrequently encountered in the course of work.

Such a description does not allow for the possibility that\nevents themselves are simultaneous, with every permutation of accident\nand action occurring at once; that only perception strings them into\nlogical sequences; or that forgetting is a balance to perception.\nThe context in which an action occurs requires a specific mode of\ndescription: a violent gesture becomes desperate, or murderous, or a\n\n\nrequest for aid. Events remain opaque, and the structural concepts\nencouraged by experience give only that climactic vision of coherence,\nthe error of the senses that is in itself a sensuous occasion.\n\nFor the same reason the retention of critical distance towards the work\nis the ideal of the auditor or reader. A type of appreciation is sought:\nthat clarity of thought that at its most sympathetic is like a friend-\nship and has some areas of trust without an undifferentiated acceptance.\nThe writer, however, as a lover of these words, has to fend off the over-\npowering attraction and the acceptance of less from an indulged expression.\nThe act of falling in love with an idea, a meter, a manner of speaking,\nhas in it all the weakness of the creation of a product not held respon-\nsible to itself.

The field of the poem includes not only the data which can\nbe comprehended by humanistic rationalism but also all that humanistic\nrationalism excludes as irrational, random, or subjective.... Olson, with\nhis obedience to all phenomena\u00bb, recognizes a possibility for order which\nderives simply from the contiguity of phenomena. \"One wants phenomenology\nin place,\" Olson writes, \"in order that event may re-arise.\" The freshness\nof space must be allowed to assert itself so it can reveal its own form.\n...The poems of Pound and Eliot, as Olson understands them, are the last\ndesperate attempts of cultivated men to insure cultural order in which\ncreation might continue to compete successfully with action.... The Cantos,\ndespite their epic intent, are essentially lyric. They create an order\u2014or\nattempt to\u2014by arranging the artifacts of culture, both western and east-\nern, according to a private vision of their transcendant coherence....\n\n     For too long language has remained so utterly within the bounds of\nrepresentational discourse, even for the poets themselves, that the occlud-\ned forms that rest below the written language have failed to emerge. Con-\nsequently, the various pure languages of poetry which have appeared are,\ndespite the power we feel in them, essentially only counter-discourse,\nnegations, rather than languages inside of which life can be conducted.\nOlson proposes to re-combine the three terms of language [space, fact,\nstance] in a single act of writing, commentary, and revelation.\n\n     In his concern for quantitative measure, Olson is attempting to purify\nthe language of the abstract pollutants which have been allowed to creep\ninto it. Before poetry can be written language must be returned to itself.\nIn quantitative measure, the duration of a syllable is an inherent factor.\nOlson objects, for example, that Milton\u2019s disregard for syllabic quantity\nresults in what might be called rhythmic sentimentality. The \"humanistic\"\nelements in Milton\u2019s verse, those which are chosen, by an act of abstract\nwill, rather than given, the stress patterns of syntax, as opposed to syl-\nlables, are allowed weight in the determination of verse which they can\n\n\nmaintain only if they draw authority from some abstract source (attaching\nthe \"emotion to the idea,\" whether the idea be Christian dogma, Latinate\nsyntax, or iambic pentameter) outside the proper concerns of the verse\nitself.... [Similarly,] in the periodic sentence, the words and syllables\nas loci of meanings are subordinated to an abstract structure which reduces\nits burden, the nouns and their actions, to mere weightless pointers which\nhave no inherent force; objects move not by their own force but by the\nabstract drama of the sentence.\n\n     The anecdotes which occur paratactically in Maximus have their effect\non the reader who, in turn, should not expect to find a heirarchy of sub-\nordinated actions. Rather than integrating categorically or according to\nchains of cause and effect, one discovers on-going associations, subject-\npuns, images answering to images, one moving to the next in terms which\nare purely local to them. Unlike stream of consciousness, however, which\nis passive, parataxis is active, attempting to bring the poem to an immedi-\nate coherence by developing concrete associations on multiple planes....\nOlson speaks of \"a syntax of apposition\", which can be opposed to a syntax\nof subordination. The order that emerges is analogous to the order of a\nmap rather than the order of a scientific law or a periodic sentence, both\nof which tear objects from their contexts, rearrange them, and subordinate\nthem to a controlling principle or, as Olson would say, logos.... Olson\nnever intends to express any thing; he insists that the poem must enact\nthe reality which is its content.\n\n     Maximus is a collage of fragments, a recognition that every person\u2019s\nlife is a collage of fragments, in the process of coalescing toward the\nwhole, where person and world are one. It does not move linearly along a single\nthread of argument but through a matrix of complex associations, juxtapo-\nsitions, dialectic contradictions, puns, melodic relationships, and com-\nplementary rhythms.... The unity of the Maximus is perhaps best compared\nto the unity of a zoological species: it is an unchanging form that per-\npetually reconstructs itself in useful and unexpected ways.\n\nDON BYRD\n"},{"uid":"DonByrd_StatementforLANGUAGE_1979","author":"Don Byrd","shortTitle":"Statement for L=AN=G=U=A=G=E","title":"Don Byrd | Statement for L=AN=G=U=A=G=E | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/014.html","text":"\nDON BYRD :\n\n\nSTATEMENT FOR L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E\n\n1.   Humans may finally become what Aristotle calls them, political\nanimals. That means we might recognize that life is in a constant state\nof emergency. Emerge(ncy). Only in that knowledge is political life\npossible. Otherwise there is reversion to a constitution, the words of\nthe king or the poet or to custom. Otherwise life is interpretation\nrather than action. Otherwise, \"History is ritual and repetition,\" as\nOlson reads it out of Melville, rather than production of what? Call it\nfresh air.\n\n     Both The Prelude and the Bessemer converter have reference only to\ntheir own consistency; both are instances of the organic in ritual\nmimicry of the inorganic (and never doubt that Bessemer converters are\nless organic than the men who design and run them). Nietzsche\u2019s mad\nlaughter was the last clamoring of the sense of ritual mastery (though\n\n\nits forms haunt us). Madness keeps open the space where the assertion\nof recurrence is uncompromised. Nietzsche\u2019s willing of will is the\nmastery of life. It is mastery cleansed of all idealism, and, so,\noblivious to the markings in the world by which idealism creates a\nshared theater.\n\n     I take it that now the tedium of repetition may overcome the satis-\nfaction. One might now prefer the uncertainty of life to the monotony\nof death.\n\n2.   Orthodox Marxism has failed to produce interesting art and art\ntheory because Marx could only envision the classless society as an\ninorganic becalm-ment. He studied the art of the western world thought-\nfully, and the utopia it proclaims, from Gilgamesh on, is death.\n\n     In this late stage of dialectical stall, we begin to see again that\nthe alienation of labor and the alienation of language are equivalent \u2014\nvery nearly interchangeable\u2014terms, as, of course, Hegel was aware:\n\u2019\u2019Language and labour are outer expressions in which the individual no\nlonger retains possession of himself per se, but lets the inner get right\noutside him, and surrenders it to something else\u201d (my emphasis). We now\nbegin to see, especially given the Lacanian discourse, that Freud and\nMarx develop Hegel by halves. Their efforts to put us back into contexts\nwhich can be lived as well as thought in effect posit an element of\nalienation as the cost of overcoming another element (death dogs even\nour best efforts).\n\n     The obvious course\u2014a synthesis of Marx and Freud \u2014 has not proven\nto be a solution. There are irreconcilable differences between Freud\u2019s\nconception of civilized discontent, for example, and Marxist utopianism,\nand, in practical terms, the demand for loosening the bonds of psychic\nrepression\u2014a bourgeois demand\u2014does not necessarily coincide with\nloosening the bonds of economic repression. Freudo-Marxists, from the\nsurrealists and Wilhelm Reich to Marcuse, current left-wing structural-\nists, and Deleuze and Guattari, have not managed to establish cogent\ntheoretical grounds for revolutionary action. The synthesis seems\ninevitably to involve either an anti-Oedipal casualness or pessimism\n(Marcuse speaks of \"the depth of the gap which separates even the\npossibilities of liberation from the established state of affairs\").\n\n     I do not want to deny the survival value of casualness or the justi-\nfiable grounds for pessimism, nor do I want to argue against my funda-\nmental sympathies. Marx\u2019s analysis, however, recognizes neither the\nantagonisms between human nature and inhuman nature (the basis for the\ntechnological utopia in which labor will be effectively eliminated), nor\nthe intensified self-consciousness the dialectic requires. Freud, on\nthe other hand, may be read as proposing a reconciliation of the indi-\nvidual to the sources of his antagonism (neo-Freudianism) or as a\nglorification of the individual and individual self-expression so\nthorough as to make communal action nearly impossible.\n\n"},{"uid":"StanleyCavell_fromTheClaimofReason_1979","author":"Stanley Cavell","shortTitle":"from The Claim of Reason","title":"Stanley Cavell | from The Claim of Reason | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn8\/pictures\/033.html","text":"\n\nfrom THE CLAIM OF REASON\n\n(The following excerpt is from Stanley Cavell's The Claim of Reason:\nWittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy, to be published in the\nautumn by Oxford University Press.

The\nconventions .\u2022\u2022 are fixed not by customs or some particular concord or\nagreement which might, without disrupting the texture of our lives, be\nchanged where convenience suggests a change. (Convenience is one aspect\nof convention, or an aspect of one kind or level of convention.) They\nare, rather, fixed by the nature of human life itself, the human fix\nitself, by those \"very general facts of nature\" which are \"unnoticed\nonly because not obvious\", and, I take it, in particular, very general\nfacts of human nature\u2014such, for example, as the fact that ... our\nknowledge (and ignorance) of ourselves and of others depends upon the\nway our minds are expressed (and distorted) in word and deed and passion;\nthat actions and passions have histories. That that should express\nunderstanding or boredom or anger ... is not necessary: someone may have\nto be said to \"understand suddenly\" and then always fail to manifest the\nunderstanding five minutes later, just as someone may be bored by an\nearthquake or by the death of his child or the declaration of marital\nlaw, or may be angry at a pin or a cloud or a fish, just as someone may\nquietly (but comfortably?) sit on a chair of nails. That human beings\non the whole do not respond in these ways is, therefore, seriously\nreferred to as conventional; but now we are thinking of convention not\nas the arrangements a particular culture has found convenient, in terms\nof its history and geography, for effecting the necessities of human\nexistence, but as those forms of life which are normal to any group of\ncreatures we call human, any group about which we will say, for example,\nthat they have a past to which they respond, or a geographical environ-\nment which they manipulate or exploit in certain ways for certain humanly\ncomprehensible motives. Here the array of \"conventions\" are not patterns\nof life which differentiate human beings from one another, but those\nexigencies of conduct and feeling which all humans share. Wittgenstein\u2019s\ndiscovery, or rediscovery, is of the depth of convention in human life;\na discovery which insists not only on the conventionality of human\nsociety but, we could say, on the conventionality of human life itself,\non what Pascal meant when he said \"Custom is our nature\"; perhaps on\nwhat an existentialist means by saying that man has no nature.\n\n    To think of a human activity as governed throughout by mere conven-\ntions, or as having conventions which may as well be changed as not,\ndepending upon some individual or other\u2019s taste or decision, is to think\nof a set of conventions as tyrannical, It is worth saying that conven-\ntions can be changed because it is essential to a convention that it be\nin service of some project, and you do not know a priori which set of\nprocedures is better than others for that project. That is, it is inter-\nnal to a convention that it be open to change in convention, in the\nconvening of those subject to it, in whose behavior it lives. So it is\n\n\na first order of business of political tyranny to deny the freedom to\nconvene....\n\n    If it is the task of the modernist artist to show that we do not\nknow a priori what will count for us as an instance of his art, then\nthis task, or fate, would be incomprehensible, or unexercisable, apart\nfrom the existence of objects which, prior to any new effort, we do\ncount as such instances as a matter of course; and apart from there\nbeing conditions which our criteria take to define such objects. Only\nsomeone outside this enterprise could think of it as an exploration of\nmere conventions. One might rather think of it as (the necessity for)\nestablishing new conventions. And only someone outside this enterprise\ncould think of establishing new conventions as a matter of exercising\npersonal decision or taste. One might rather think of it as the explora-\ntion or education or enjoyment or chastisement of taste and of decision\nand of intuition, an exploration of the kind of creature in whom such\ncapacities are exercised....\n\n    When my reasons come to an end and I am thrown back upon myself,\nupon my nature as it has so far shown itself, I can, supposing I cannot\nshift the ground of discussion ... use the occasion to go over the\nground I had hitherto thought foregone. If the topic is that of contin-\nuing a series, it may be learning enough to find that I just do; to\nrest upon myself as my foundation. But if the child, little or big,\nasks me: Why do we eat animals? or Why are some people poor and others\nrich? ... or Who owns the land? or Why is there anything at all? .., I\nmay find my answers thin, I may feel run out of reasons without being\nwilling to say \"This is what I do\", what I say, what I sense, what I\nknow, and honor that.\n\n    Then I may feel that my foregone conclusions were never conclusions\nI had arrived at, but were merely imbibed by me, merely conventional. I\nmay blunt that realization through hypocrisy or cynicism or bullying.\nBut I may take the occasion to throw myself back upon my culture, and\nask why we do what we do, judge as we judge, how we have arrived at\nthese crossroads. What is the natural ground of our conventions, to\nwhat are they in service? It is inconvenient to question a convention;\nthat makes it unserviceable, it no longer allows me to proceed as a\nmatter of course; the paths of action, the paths of words, are blocked.\n\"To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life\".

Present developments are of two means: 'high tech' (word processing, computer printout),\nsay a connection to Reuters for information units on selected areas of interest, the markets, in your\nbreast pocket, push-button teleprinters (more time conservative than the boardroom scenario\ncassettes put out by large banks for the commuter in a car); and 'low tech' principally mimeo, small\nletterpress, offset lithography, photostats, cut blocks, soaks, oils on water, the etcetera variations.\n\n                            originals give only a very imperfect picture\n                            of the beauty of reproductions\n\n\t\t\t\tquoted from allen fisher's 'Prosyncel'\n\t\t\t\tattributed to Schropfer or Bulkowski\n\n          On terms in touch with overall design (jump suits?) of a book space a press such as Black\nSparrow (to cite an example that American readers will know) has to be mediocre, in spite of and\npossibly because of its audience pretension. It\u2019s not just the forms of presentation that change, but\nthe ways forms are presented!\n\n          In London, England, there is a Consortium of London Presses. This formed between presses\nprepared to make their production machinery mutually accessible, or collectively owned. The\nextensions of this process now include cassette tape, reel to reel tapes and film equipment. Under\nsuch giving circumstances collaborations are frequently provoked and flourish. Collaboration involves\ninterferences.\n\nPerfection \u2014 Constancy \u2014 Consistency are terms applicable to a static state of affairs that this writer would wish to be\nconsidered outside of.\n\n                                                                  allen fisher, \u2018A sketch map of heat'\n\n          The size of the page that we work onto, the texture to be printed on, the color, the choice is\nobvious and informs the work. To have the facility that allows acceptance or rejection of mistakes in\ntyping, stenciling, setting, proofing, in the platemaking or inking intensity or position of text on the\npage when printing, of every physical aspect of this process, these are created inventions not\nideologies. Words are actions, it is physical. What is important here is that to extract one element of\n\n\nthis processual space and reproduce the same in a magazine or anthology is to re-present rather than\npresent, amounts to translation.\n\n         Economically the move is again making a difference. These books (we tend to prefer little\npress to small press) are not printed for profit. They are social gifts and exquisite interference to a\npublic hooped and coddled into habits of expectation. Books can be produced with immediacy and\nout onto the street quickly. Leave copies of books or separate pages or covers, on trains, buses, boats,\nin book stores, libraries, cafes, bars, there's no limit. Books that feel and appear different, not\negotistical but other. Capitalism markets aspects, designs markets \u2014 use these procedures to bend\nexpectations, commodity fetishism will have a shadow smudging with its cleanliness. Make an affront\non decency. Form cooperatives, buy cheap machinery, make a difference obvious. Employ\ndiscretions.\n\nA Sampler\n\nThe works being presented are not visual or concrete poetry. In some cases they are used as texts for\nlive events but their interest as books involving social production, as gifts meaning sharing, is what\nmakes them worth mentioning. The interaction of the processes used in production is what makes\ninteresting reading.\n\nLiving Room Blue Living Room by Ulrich Flamme (Atman Press c\/o 4 Bower Street, Kent M16\n         85D). beautiful room space, exterior design allowing asterisked prose, d o u b l e and single\n         space typing, newspaper cuttings firearms, hand written over and all at all angles. spacing\n         vibrates etc.\n\nTransparencies by Ellen Berlin (for Harry Lane). typed straight onto offset litho greased paper plates,\n         folded, worked onto directly with a palette knife and fingers, then printed. speed in decision\n         and not much chance to correct. strange reversals, as in a mirror spattered with tooth paste\n         and soap, sprayed with foam and scored by a pastry cutter, printed in blue, alternate text\/\n         background\/ no text.

Capitalism is profoundly\nilliterate. The death of writing is like the death of God or the death\nof the father: the thing was settled a long time ago, although the news\nof the event is slow to reach us, and there survives in us the memory of\nextinct signs with which we still write. The reason for this is simple:\nwriting implies a use of language in general according to which graphism\nbecomes aligned on the voice, but also overcodes it and induces a fic-\ntitious voice from on high that functions as a signifier. The arbitrary\nnature of the thing designated, the subordination of the signified, the\ntranscendence of the despotic signifier, and finally, its consecutive\ndecomposition into minimal elements within a field of immanence uncovered\nby the withdrawal of the despot \u2014 all this is evidence that writing\nbelongs to imperial despotic representation...Of course capitalism has\nmade and continues to make use of writing; not only is writing adapted\nto money as the general equivalent, but the specific functions of money\nin capitalism went by way of writing and printing, and in some measure\ncontinue to do so...\u201d\n\n\"Fourteen dollars and twenty eight cents is more attractive than fourteen\ndollars because of the 28.\"\n\nWHEREfS HABIT FORMING\n\nWriting can\u2019t be limited to dealing with capitalism. Capitalism is a\nsetback. Writing as it relates to capitalism is the limitation the\nframework poses. The concerns should be against oppressive structures.\nWriting has become referential to itself\u2014to the making of objects.\nWhen writing informs writing & writers & writing writers the systems are\nsecurities.\n\nSHKLOVSKI'S KUGEL\n\nLiterature, rather than visual or performance work, is the only useful\nresidue left to us of Russian Futurism. True________ False____\n\nThere are no differences between feudal states and capitalist states.\n\n                                            True____ False____\n\nWhere\u2019s the structural control.             True____ False____\n\nLanguage (as understood in its use in a community) is comprised of appro-\nximately ten per cent verbal elements; the rest consists of gesture, at-\nmosphere, billboards, environmental drift, etc.\n\n                                            True___ False___\n\n\nPublishing is imperialism.                   True___ False_____\n\nI embody all that I most must hate & fear. True_____ False_____\n\nWRITING IS A CONSERVATIVE TENDENCY\n\nIf writing is to defuse oppressive structures rather than re-fuse them\nits first task is not to be the mechanics of escapism. Lullabies are\nmade of words. When words set themselves up they form double binds.\nNarrative constitutes a parallel life which absorbs the reader leaving\nher\/his body depoliticized. Repressed sexualities objectify themselves\nthrough the use and design of machinery. The typewriter is not a lover.\nThe investment of sexuality in mechanics leads writers to confuse\neroticism with death, the erotic with the dead. What dies is not the\nauthor but the authenticating enunciation sustained by the immortality\ngranted the subject. Properly speaking, \u2019\u2019glyphs\u201d are the signatures\n(cuts in the ear, brandmarks) of the owners of their cattle.\n\nNOTES TO MYSELF\n\nThink of   it as why we had to cook my poor dad\u2019s flesh. Think  of it  as\n\nopen before  using. Think of   it as vanity and sink. Think of  it as our\n\nown. Think of it as fresh daily. Think of it as I will behave in line.\nThink of   it as 60 cycle hum.  Think of it as proudly we hail these.\n\nThink of   it as exclusive adhesive. Think of it as most folks use.\n\nThink of it as sheer bandages. Think of it as all purpose grind. Think\nof it as capitalism is a setback. Think of it as machines do it for\nyou. Think of it as June 1979. Think of it as the people\u2019s pharmacy.\nThink of it as a small curd. Think of it as not less than. Think\nof it as our mail. Think of it as new easy re-close. Think of it\nas drink your drink. Think of it as amusement only. Think of it\nas a half a dozen of another. Think of it as a wet book. Think of it\nas a soggy cover. Think of it as money talks. Think of it as you can\nlaugh all you want. Think of it as that means I can do what. Think of\nit as do you read me. Think of it as a lot to look forward to. Think\nof it as the author has no authority.\n\nGROWN ASLEEP\n\n\nThe ghosts of eroticism, so clear in the piston & cylinder, oblique into\ninformation storage & retrieval.\n\n\u201d \u2014 It was only after the remaining two had consumed what food they had \u2014\nsome chocolate bars, a bag of potato chips, a granola bar and cough\ndrops \u2014 did they decide to eat Don Johnson. \u2019We talked to God and we\nprayed, and whatever else came we knew we had to eat him and we did. I\nwant it known that we aren\u2019t ashamed. We knew it was right. God told\nus it was right. We knew it was what Don would have wanted,\u2019 he\nexplained...\u201d\n\n\nThe endorsement of hierarchies induces specialization. Mystification\nis manipulative. Its power misleads in appearing to be productive\nenergy; it is not generative, it\u2019s mediocre. An objective life is un-\ndesire. When sacrifice to the revolution begins revolution ends: here\nwe mean subjectivity without individualism; micropolitics; simultaneous\nmultiple corners. Hierarchies control through achievement by regulating\n& witholding information as to the means of achieving: honesty\u2019s broken\nspoon. It\u2019s hard to be totally positive. \u2019\u2019Giordano Bruno comes to mind,\nwhoever he is.\u201d \"$14.28 is more attractive than $14, it\u2019s just that\nway.\" \"Giordano Bruno, I think they burned him, he was too positive.\"\n\nSOME DO & SOME DO: SHAMANISM, CYBERNETICS, & REPRESENTATION\n\n\"...Lo!

AS LANGUAGE IS CONSTRUCTED FROM SOUNDS, PHONEMES, AND WORDS\nGROUPED INTO SENTENCES, SO FILM MEANING TURNS ONTO ITSELF REDEFINING THE\nFRAME, SHOT AND SCENE.\n\nTHE TASK: TO SEPARATE FILM FROM ITS HISTORICAL MOMENT: THAT OF AN\nILLUSION DEVICE\n\nOR \u2014 THAT IT IS AN ILLUSION DEVICE, AND SO USED TO RAISE THE QUESTION.\n\n\nA basis of Snow\u2019s work is its opposition to popular cinematic practice.\nTo this end, he explores a multitude of subversions in synchronous sound,\nscripted speech, the narrative mode. At one point, a romance is\ndestroyed. The bed of the lovers is shown as illusion: they lie on the\nfloor. The language is instructional: \"theres another side to every\nstory\" \"touching is believing\". A table appears and disappears. The\nsuperimposition is announced \"watch this\" as are the improbable sounds:\n\"I didn\u2019t know you could speak trumpet.\" Earlier in the film, Snow juxta-\nposes the rearrangement of objects on his desk with a voice describing\nthe activity, alternately falling ahead or behind the action.\n\nThroughout the film, language and sound are used asymptotically to image,\nand explicitly so.\n\nFOR IF THE PARALLEL TO LANGUAGE IS REWARDING, IT IS NOT COMPLETE.\nITS MEAT IS DIFFERENT: IMAGE\/EYE vs. LETTER\/SOUND\n\nThis movement from letter to image is the explicit content of Frampton\u2019s\nZORNS LEMMA, a film constructed in three parts: the first being black\nleader accompanied by a voice reading from the Bay State Primer; the\nsecond, a patterned replacement of the alphabet (or more exactly pictures\nof the letters of the alphabet) with images that over time transform\nthemselves into an alphabet of personal visions in 24 frame, one second\nunits; the third a long (apparent) one-shot take of two figures departing\ninto the landscape accompanied by a medieval text on light.\n\nAPART FROM THE ATTENDANT INEQUALITIES IN THE MODE OF PERCEPTION, FILM IS\nLESS CODIFIED THAN LANGUAGE. WHEREAS THE LETTER\/SOUND A AS IN FATHER OR\nMAD HAS UNDERGONE LIVING AND DISTANCED ITSELF FROM A PERCEPTUAL ASSOCIA-\nTION (i.e., ITS LEXATION OVERRIDES ITS PHYSICAL SOUND) THE FILM FRAME\nREMAINS AN OPEN VARIABLE. IT CAN CARRY A MULTIPLE OF COMPLEX MEANINGS\nWHICH CAN BE REGISTERED, IF NOT READ, AT A GLANCE. PERHAPS OH OR OUR\nEXPLETIVES ARE COMPARABLE.\n\nFILM, I AM SUGGESTING, IS MORE A LANGUAGE INVENTING MACHINE THAN A LAN-\nGUAGE (THIS, ONCE THE NARRATIVE STRANGLEHOLD IS DROPPED).

BOTH THE TOOL AND\nFRUIT OF ITS AGE, FILM EXISTS AT THE START OF THE LEVEL OF INTELLIGIBILITY.\nONCE FREED OF THE NARRATIVE STRANGLEHOLD, FILM OFFERS ITSELF AS A UNIQUE\nMODEL TO CONFRONT THE WORLD WITHOUT THE FORMS OF HISTORY.\n\nTO CREATE A MODEL OF ACTION THAT COMPELS US TO LISTEN\/CREATE A MODEL OF\nVISION THAT COMPELS US TO THINK.\n\nYET IF FILM HAS THIS POTENTIAL FREEDOM BEYOND LANGUAGE, IT (LIKE PHYSICS)\nIS BOUND TO ITS MECHANISM AND THE 'HAND BEHIND THE SCENE\u2019.

the\nbook as we know it today cannot be fully understood without seeing it in\nterms of its materialist determination - the discovery of printing and\nits status as a commodity....\n\nthe variation in modes of literality is thus determined by the artist\u2019s\nattitude to the materiality that contains him\/her; these attitudes have\nnot fallen from the sky, they are determined by the artist\u2019s own\nrelations in materiality: class origin, relation to the productive\nforces, those of \u00e9criture in particular....\n\nwe begin with a \u2019structuralist\u2019 analysis of the processes at work within\nthe text, processes which are that text\u2019s own space and movement only\nto take them further by examining the relationship of text-author-\nsociety, the text\u2019s MATERIALITY.\n\npoetry is artifice, a construct. it is capable of defining its own\nreality on its own terms, an investigation into poetics concentrates\ntherefore not on what literature contains - which is generally to recu-\nperate it into a normative ideology - but on HOW it contains its\ndatum.... progressive art makes no attempt to hide its status as\nARTIFICE, openly laying bare its techniques of construction,,.,\nmaterialist poetics seeks to rescue this valuable doctrine from its\nidealist distortion resulting from the structuralists\u2019 concept of\nliterature as a self-contained, self-metamorphosing realm, an analysis\nof any literature shows that laying bare the methods of production is\nnever necessarily in itself progressive if the process of revelation\nis confined to infratextuality - the poems of walther von der vogelweide,\neg. it is only progressive on the plane of art, and this plane a\nmaterialist can never see as wholly isolated, although s\/he accords it\nits own existence.\n\n\nif our own poetic praxis is to be consciously materialist and progressive\nthen we are concerned not simply with the laying bare of the artifice\nof all art - this is the death of any bourgeois concepts of \u2019finish\u2019 -\nbut with the laying bare of the TEXT\u2019S MODE OF PRODUCTION IN SOCIETY -\nits MATERIALITY, our poetry thus evolves from a critique of the\nbourgeois expectations of a work of art, namely that it should be\n\u2019finished\u2019 and \u2019accomplished\u2019, to being a critique of that whole society\nthat is its matrix....\n\nthis is what i mean by a dialectic of autonomy and determination: we\nmove between the two in order to pose the necessity of destroying deter-\nminants which are those of capitalism, so that the real autonomy of art\nis achieved in a higher mode of materiality, communist society.\n\n"},{"uid":"BobCobbing_NotionsNotations_1980","author":"Bob Cobbing","shortTitle":"Notions & Notations","title":"Bob Cobbing | Notions & Notations | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn12\/pictures\/029.html","text":"\nNOTIONS & NOTATIONS\n\n(The following is an excerpt of an article by Bob Cobbing that appeared\noriginally in Lobby, 44A Hobson Street, Carribridge, England. Cobbing has\nrecently edited, with Peter Mayer, an important compilation, Concerning\nConcrete Poetry, $6.50 from Writers Forum, 262 Randolph Ave., London W9.)\n\n\n     ... In her introduction to \u2019Stone Tones\u2019, published in 1974, Paula\nClaire writes : \u2019During 1972, while interpreting pieces like Bob\nCobbing\u2019s \u201915 Shakespeare-kaku\u2019, \u2019The Judith Poem\u2019 and \u2019Mary Rudolf\u2019s\nChromosomes\u2019, I got used not only to improvising to deliberately ambi-\nguous letter forms, but to blobs, smudges and dashes among these letter\npatterns. So, by May, 1973, I found my eye drawn to patterning on\nstones, bark, water, woodknots, sliced cabbages, cobwebs... and recog-\nnised them as sound poems.\u2019\n\nThis realization that every mark could be sounded led many of those who\nattended the London experimental workshops to make texts for performance\nwhich might include words or letter forms, but also markings of every\nkind, perhaps resembling natural forms or perhaps with more mechanical\nintention. The workshops were the opportunity for these texts to be\nregarded as \u2019song-signals\u2019, as scores for performance pieces, but al-\nways improvised so that one text could engender a multitude of inter-\npretations.\n\nMany of these occasions were recorded, and it is instructive to listen\n\n\nto the same text as it developed in performance from week to week, or,\nin some cases, from year to year. It is difficult to convey this on\nthe printed page, but one attempt has been made to follow a poem\nthrough various performances and to describe what happened. In an\narticle in Lobby Press Newsletter (No. 5, December 1978) Cris Cheek\nanalyses five performances of Lawrence Upton\u2019s poem \u2019Salt Carrier\u2019,\nwhich is a verbal piece, very concrete in material and permitting\nimprovisation. I have extracted from this article the actual descrip-\ntive words relating to the five performances :\n\n1  the piece was read very quietly, asking the audience to focus its\nattention carefully on one voice, and stretch its hearing almost to the\ninaudible.\n\n2  on tape, the source material generated by three voices, one leading,\nwith the other two rotating around this reading, not straying from the\noriginal words and word order; and this material then treated by\nelectronic devices until the units, uttered originally quite distinctly,\nbegan to turn in on themselves, to wave and fold and blur.\n\n3  a live rendition in a large hall, one speaker placed centrally to\nthe audience, the other two at either side converging slowly onto the\none, the text beginning to distort, words being shuffled frequently\nfrom one context to another, a de-centralisation of modulated inter-\naction, stretching the lengths of word pronunciation, a stretching of\nsurface tensions through space\/time, incorporating much which had been\nlearnt from the possibilities opened up by the electronically treated\nversion.\n\n4  a similar variation in a far smaller room, the central performer\nmaking extensive use of a microphone to emphasize his prominence, the\nbackground voices increasingly not used to \u2019set-off\u2019 the subject but\ntaking equal focus, teasing fresh relations within the extant text,\ngiving words a shape and expression sometimes in collision with their\ngiven context.\n\n5  the same three performers, the written text not consulted, an agree-\nment to work from memory\u2014of previous performances, not of the text\u2014\neach poet moves into a reading in a more exploratory sense, as if, for\nthe first time, discovering materials that each wished to shape to his\nown conception, the author\u2019s original directions having been deliber-\nately discarded; if anything the two wing speakers move slightly away\nfrom the central figure, the audience\u2019s focus of attention drawn from\none body to another in continual motion, each interfering with and trans-\nlating what is heard to left of right \u2014 all three were surprised by\nthis particular performance, which was a result of an active process\nof learning through an insistence on risk and change. Cris Cheek,\ncommenting on Variation 5, says of himself and Clive Fencott who took\n\n\npart, with Lawrence Upton, in the performance, that \u2019we were involved in\nthe making of a work for ourselves.\u2019 Each of those taking part is a\ncreative \u2019poet\u2019, and not just a performer....\n\nA text is both a completed action in itself and the signal for ren-\nderings, vocal, in musical form, in movement, with lights or elec-\ntronics, in many ways, singly or in combination.

I\ncouldn\u2019t stand the idea of one word. I don\u2019t think there is one word.\nSo this is one of those poems. I did maybe twenty or thirty of these.\nI suppose they\u2019re about as unadulterated, pure, if you will, as anything\nI ever did. I was really trying to work with the words, look at the\nwords, try to use all their qualities. There\u2019s no question of meaning,\nin the sense of explaining and understanding this poem. Hopefully, it\u2019s\na unique object, not just an object. Language isn\u2019t just objects, it\nmoves. I\u2019ll try to talk about some of the qualities of these words\nthat I was aware of when I was writing it, as best I can. It was\neleven years ago.\n\n    \u2019\u2019ounce code orange\u201d: ways of measuring, in a sense. Weight, a\nsymbol system, a color. \"a\/the\u201d: the indefinite article, the definite\narticle. \u201dohm\" is the unit of electrical resistance, a quality of metal\nlet\u2019s say, that requires a certain amount of juice to go through. In\nother words, this is a fuzzy, resistant word> It hangs down here, it\naffects particularly this space. I wanted these things hanging in the\nmiddle because they could adhere to words in either the top line or the\nbottom line. \"the ounce,\" \"a\/the code,\u201d \"the orange.\u201d You can\u2019t say\n\u201da ounce\" or \"a orange,\" practically. You can say \"a code.\" So there\nare those vectors going there. \"trilobites\": you know what a trilobite\nis, it\u2019s an early animal of the Paleozoic Age that was a crustacean\ndivided into three lobes. As a word, to me it\u2019s completely irreducible.\nWhat are you going to do with it? \"A trilobite\": it\u2019s like a clinker.\nAngular, uneven, heavy word. So, I made a plural, and I also say,\n\"trilobite trilobites.\" That second trilobite becomes a verb. And I\nfeel, as Fenollosa pointed out, that every noun is a verb, and vice\nversa, and there really are a hell of a lot of them in the English\nlanguage which don\u2019t connect except in being the same word, like the\nword \"saw.\" \"I saw the saw.\"...\n\n    ... Well, \"trilobite trilobites\": it sounds like a rudiment, a para-\ndiddle or something you have to practice. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t like.\nIt\u2019s not [hums a bop rhythm]. You know, it\u2019s not as shapely, which\nI\u2019ve tried to do more of since.... I also found out later that \"ounce\"\nis the name for a kind of leopard. I don\u2019t know if anybody knows that,\nI think it\u2019s Indian, or Tibetan. It\u2019s a cat called an ounce. So, you\nthink of \"pounce.\" There are these words that begin to adhere and\nappear like ghosts around these things. Ounce, pounce, bounce, \"code\u201d\n\u2014 I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s beginning to seem a little neutral to me,\n\"Orange\": the color and the round thing, the fruit. Now that I\u2019ve said\nthat, the word \"ounce\" begins to seem round to me, \"A trilobite,\" \"the\ntrilobites.\" That\u2019s how that goes. And this is the dead spot of the\n\n\npoem, the resistance: \"ohm.\" And it\u2019s also almost like the \"Om,\" the\nbalance. ...\n\n\n\n                                                   CLARK COOLIDGE\n"},{"uid":"ClarkCoolidge_FromOwnFaceANote_1980","author":"Clark Coolidge","shortTitle":"From Own Face: \"A Note\"","title":"Clark Coolidge | From Own Face: \"A Note\" | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/015.html","text":"\nFrom Own Face: \"A Note\"\n\nI think then I live in a world of silence.\n\nThe language has become lodged in itself a background,\nwall of rock, black and resistant as basalt, then sometimes\nas viscous as heavy grease, poetry must be reached into\nand rested from in a cry.

A presence realized through an inte-\n grated design, an architecture. Yet this is a tentative architecture,\n perhaps a scaffolding the height and shape of which suggests the building\n we take to be there but perceive in glimpses through the scaffolding and\n construct in our imaginations.\n\n  Nowhere is it written that books of poetry must have an order beyond what\n the table of contents presents. American poets from Whitman through\n Pound to Olson, Spicer and beyond have sought an order, a form, that will\n carry all the poet has to say. Palmer\u2019s concern may be seen as similar\n\n\n  but in a significant way (or he may be more intense about it) he diverges.\n\nHis poems (the parts) are to the book (the whole) as the lines of each\npoem are to the poem.\n\n     \"You can never step in the same cloud twice (in the same\n      song twice)\"\n\nPalmer seeks to permit the poem to connect as many diverse elements as\npossible - Polysynthesis - to propose rather than dictate so that each\npoem suggests something beyond itself. \"Content,\" as de Kooning said,\n\"is a slippery glimpse.\"\n\nThe poems are relentless but not predictable. They are tense but sturdy. )\nNot about to crack.\n\n\nWithout music. Acapella. For the past four years Palmer has been making\ndances in collaboration with the dancer Margaret Jenkins. His words -\nher choreography. Without music? Palmer\u2019s music, his \"noise\u201d is dry,\ncomes from the throat:\n\n     \u2019Only the birds\u2019 she said\n\n     \u2019clearing their throats\u2019\n\nThe tone has a precise edge to it. Crisp, it seems hardly to vary, but\nits accuracy is telling. Without music, but the book returns again and\nagain to songs and dances. A tone that is toneless and will not draw\nattention to itself, will not overwhelm the song.\n\n     \"the song \/ of the jungle partridge \/\/ is the purest \/\n      something like a flute \/ with no tones at all.\"\n\n\n     \"the figure unconscious in the leather chair\"\n\n     \"A sleeper wakes up but not too much \/ enough for an alphabet\"\n\n     \"complex sleep\"\n\nPalmer works the image of sleep, the figure of a sleeper \"awake and\nfearing sleep,\" awake and sleeping, \"asleep between concertos\" and\n\"sleeping among stones\" into the book\u2019s larger design.\n\nSleep - Between speech and dreams?\n\n        Between one language and another?\n\nAlthough this is the kind of strand not present in Palmer\u2019s earlier work,\nor not so developed, the image does not dominate, does not articulate a\n\n\ntheme. Stones also recur. And the word alphabet. Colors or the words\nfor colors are less prominent in Without Music, but the fascination with\nnumbers persists. Is, ones, three, fives, six, eleven and 14. Image\nis secondary. The language, sentences not phrases, is primary.\n\nLanguage disturbed so that unlikely combinations provoke new responses,\nand there is both beauty and mystery in the meanings that insist\nthemselves.\n\nSeveral times while reading Without Music I laughed out loud. Palmer\u2019s\nhumor, more in evidence than before, is equal parts matter-of-fact\ndeadpan and chagrin:\n\n     \"A hamburger and sand up your ass \/ is more like it\"\n\n\nA way into Without Music is through the back door, the book\u2019s final\npoem \"The Meadow\" dedicated to Robert Duncan in which Palmer quotes the\nphrase \"folded in all thought\" from \"Often I Am Permitted To Return To A\nMeadow\" the first poem in Duncan\u2019s The Opening of the Field. Duncan\u2019s\npoem thus recalled supplies this stanza to illuminate Palmer\u2019s work:\n\n     \"She is Queen Under The Hill\n\n      whose hosts are a disturbance of words within words\n\n      that is a field folded.\"\n\n                                                   WILLIAM CORBETT\n\n"},{"uid":"WilliamCorbett_SeventeenTitlesJoeBrainardWillUseOneDay_1980","author":"William Corbett","shortTitle":"Seventeen Titles Joe Brainard Will Use One Day","title":"William Corbett | Seventeen Titles Joe Brainard Will Use One Day | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/012.html","text":"\n  SEVENTEEN TITLES JOE BRAINARD WILL USE ONE DAY\n\n  JOE BRAINARD, I Remember (1975; Full Court Press, 15 Laight Street, New\n  York, NY 10013; $3.50)\n\n  I Forgot To Remember\n\n  Boy Scout Cookies\n\n  Truer Words Were Never Said\n\n  A Regular Joe\n\n  Read Any Good Books Lately?\n\n  50 Words or Less\n\n  Some Old Work\n\n\n  You Had To Be There\n\n\nThe Fruit Book\n\n\nMongol Pencils, Tartar Sauce\nToo Soon Old Too Late Smart\nOne Hundred and One Liners\nYou\u2019re Going To Turn Into One!\nPeanut Butter & Jelly Sandwiches\nThe Shirt Off My Back\nGod Knows\nMake It Small\n\n\n        BILL CORBETT\n"},{"uid":"WilliamCorbett_ReviewsandNotes_1980","author":"William Corbett","shortTitle":"Reviews and Notes","title":"William Corbett | Reviews and Notes | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/029.html","text":"LORINE NIEDECKER, Blue Chicory (1976; The Elizabeth Press, 103 Van Etten Blvd., New Rochelle, NY 10804)\nStevens, Santayana, Margaret Fuller, Ruskin, LZ, Bunting, Hopkins, William Morris, Darwin, Thomas Jefferson (Inside and out) these from Niedecker's condensary.

She was using the\nvocabulary of the 'Old World' (terms from the classics, mythology, the Bible, Latin liturgy, and so\non) and combining it with experimental techniques such as the fragmentation of words and the\nisolation of individual letters. With this mix, who would be her readers? I took her work to heart with\nthis puzzle in mind.\n\n        From the start, I heard Susan's work against the backdrop of the '70s as the decade of the\nwomen's movement 'lit crit' division. Whenever I take up one of her books, I am reminded of the\nendless discussion groups dealing with the topic of the 'politically correct' woman writer. The sum of\nthese meetings sounded something like this: because the formation of our language came about\nthrough commerce controlled by men, our language is structured to serve their needs and is, in\nessence, 'male-oriented'. The only way to challenge this orientation, then, is through the stream of\nconsciousness technique, since writing coming from the subconscious can bring forth new patterns of\ninformation not yet co-opted by commerce. Conversely, to write abstractly was to use the 'language\nof business\u2019 to play Western patriarchy's game and thereby continue the patterns of male oppression.\n\n        Of all the assumptions in that line of reasoning, the one that continues to bother me the\nmost is the stereotyping of the 'process' of women's creative power as still the private, intuitive energy\nthat gives birth to something new, another form of 'motherhood'. Analytical thought continued to be\nman's domain, and a dirty realm at that.\n\n        Susan began writing poetry around 1970 (after painting for ten years) and I regret not\nknowing her work back then. Her first book, Hinge Picture (Telephone, 1974) could have brought\nsome needed clarity to our women's group discussions that grew increasingly embroiled in ideological\narguments that obscured real feelings and real events, both past and present. Hinge Picture begins\nwith Susan stating 'She rises while it is yet dark, to trace a military combination\/ in the sand,\nsinging...' (p. 5) and trace she does with lists and simple sentences becoming an outline of patriarchal\nmores incorporating all the characters passed down to us through literature. Technically, she then\nstartles these 'old stories' by fragmenting them and using (for example) isolated 'e' and 's' sounds to\nscreech and hiss at them.\n\n                                        five princes\n                                        buried their\n                                        father divid\n                                        ed his subjec\n                                        ts forgot his\n                                        advice separ\n                                        ated from eac\n                                        h other and w\n                                        andered in qu\n                                        est of fortun\n                                        e         (p. 14)\n\n&\n\n                                        a king\n                                        delight\n                                        s in war (p. 15)\n\nShe concludes Hinge Picture by placing her work firmly in the matriarchal tradition: (from 'breaking\nall the rules', the final poem)'Deliver us back to the wide world's oldest song\/ when mother was a\nfairy woman same root as Finn\/ pinion on the clean fin clear clear wave'.\n\n          All this is not to say that Susan writes as a 'political' poet, but that I read her as one. While\nother writers were talking about getting to the roots of women's literature, Susan had placed herself\nthere and was ready to take on other projects, such as: The Western Borders (Tuumba Press, 1976), an\nelaboration on the nursery rhyme 'oh would I were where I would be!'; an analysis of the word 'mark'\nand all its definitions (Mark being the name of both her father and her son) that was published as\nSecret History of the Dividing Line (Telephone, 1978); a response to Boswell's quote of Johnson\n('...The poem might begin with the advantages of civilized society over a rude state, exemplified by\nthe Scotch, who had no cabbages till Oliver Cromwell's soldiers introduced them...') published as\nCabbage Gardens (Fathom Press, 1979); and her most recent book, The Liberties (Loon Books, 1980),\na narrative account of the relationship of Jonathan Swift and 'Stella' followed by (among other\nthings) a play documenting in dialogue the fragmented, lonely nature of their lives that is tied to the\nlegacy of literary history by the addition of another player, Lear's Cordelia.\n\n          I see the final section of The Liberties, 'Formation of a Separatist, I,' as a point of departure\nback into Susan's work as a whole:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI am composed of nine letters.\n\n                                            solus with a letter\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tS\n\n                                            Here set at liberty...\n\n\nLiterally, she is spelling out her reason for writing \u2014 experimentation with the patterns of words\nhanded down to her equals freedom. She stands up against the weight of our language's history and,\nas an intellectual, fights back \u2014 an act of liberation that is valid on its own and in many ways\ncompliments the struggle of those bringing up information from the subconscious.\n\n"},{"uid":"TinaDarragh_Procedure_1979","author":"Tina Darragh","shortTitle":"Procedure","title":"Tina Darragh | Procedure | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/011.html","text":"\n            PROCEDURE\n\n\n    \"Oran\" to \"ordain\" for \"J\"\n\n\n    orchestration = he raves\n\n\n     The prefix for \"Ceylon trail\" promises \"main orange\" after\n    orbits.

So I: take what is at hand (the dictionary),\npick a page at random, use the key words heading the page as \"direc-\ntions\", find a pattern and\/or flow of the words and write it down,\ntrying to retain as much of the procedure as possible in the prose.\n\n    Examples: 1) in the page \"legion to Lent\", the sound \"lem\" reoccurs\nat various points on the page. By graphing these points, I find that\nthey produce a figure eight. I tell the reader about the graph and list\nthe words contained within the figure. Many of the \"lem\" words are\n\"fiber\" words, so I also mention the various fibers that can make up\nthe figure. 2) the word \"dog\" falls between \"Doctor of Philosophy\" and\n\"doge\". The dog definition is divided between technical and colloquial\nones. The other words on the page reflect this division. I note this\nalong with a description of the dog definition. 3) in \"Oran\" to\n\"ordain\", I find that \"orchestration\" is related to \"he raves\". So,\nto orchestrate the page, I rave. Letting my finger drop at random over\nand over, I make a notation of the points my finger makes and later\ntranscribe them.\n\n    Dictionary language (words\/phrases giving a direction\/relation to\na source - \"of or pertaining to\", \"peculiar to or characteristic of\",\n\"connected with or considered from\", etc.) isn't offensive to me the\nway it is to many, including Ponge. In Things, he declares that the\nfunction of the dictionary is to limit - ie: deaden - the language.\nThat's true, I suppose, when dealing with single entries and their\nmeaning. But what interests me is the coincidence and juxtaposition\nof the words on the page in their natural formation (alphabetical\norder). In reference to each other, they have a story of their own.\nThe technical aspect (scientific and philosophical terminology as dis-\ntinct from conversational forms) of the language can be intriguing, too.\nReading the definitions is like reading a foreign language developed\nspecifically for English.\n\n\nTINA DARRAGH\n"},{"uid":"TinaDarragh_ReviewsandNotes_1980","author":"Tina Darragh","shortTitle":"Reviews and Notes","title":"Tina Darragh | Reviews and Notes | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/042.html","text":"\nHANNAH WEINER, Virgin (1978; A Hundred Posters, c\/o Davies, 689 East\n17th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11230; $1)\n\nAfter seeing \u2019\u2019The Last Wave\u201d (the Australian movie in which Richard\nChamberlain discovers he\u2019s a psychic through his relationship with some\nurban aborigines) .

One pro-\nposes that her writing is all play, that it derives strictly out of\nher early researches with William James and motor automism and was\nlater invigorated by Cubist formalism. The other proposes that Stein\n\n\nis a kind of hermetic Symbolist who encodes sexual and biographical\ninformation in complex little verbal machines which contextualize\ntheir own environments. Both views operate on either side of a refe-\nrential paradigm; one wants her to mean nothing and the other wants\nher to mean intrinsically, But what makes TENDER BUTTONS so vital\nis not the strategies by which meaning is avoided or encoded but how\neach piece points at possibilities for meaning. Unlike the Symbolist\nwho creates beautiful detachable artifacts, Stein\u2019s prose is firmly\ntied to the world\u2014but it is a world constantly under construction, a\nworld in which the equation of word and thing can no longer be taken\nfor granted, \"The difference is spreading\" not only foreshadows\ndeconstructive thought; it recognizes that between one term (a carafe)\nand a possible substitute (a blind glass) exists a barrier, not an\nequal sign, and it is this difference which supports all signification.\nStein interrogates this barrier in order to break open the imperial\nSign and leave \"a system to pointing,\" a language that no longer needs\nto contain the world in order to live in it.\n\n    What\u2019s the good of all this? Obviously we know what a carafe is or\nnickel or roast beef, but Stein doesn\u2019t much care whether these things\nare self-evident. She does care that we\u2019ve come to regard writing as\nthe discovery of concrete counters for feelings, objects and places,\nthat human memory is valorized over human mind in the act of creation.\n\"A name is adequate or it is not. If it is adequate then why go on\ncalling it...\" she writes, inveighing against the noun\u2019s authoritarian\nstasis. What she wants is movement, a shifting of words among other\nwords\u2014not to erase their ability to refer but to make that act as\npolymorphous and perverse as any sexual play. TENDER BUTTONS as a\ntitle suggests words binding the fabric of language together but also\nthe sexual (clitoral) excitation potential in all linguistic play.\n\n    Each of the pieces in TENDER BUTTONS seems, at some level, to refer\nto Stein\u2019s decontextualizing strategies, \"A Carafe, That is a Blind\nGlass,\" is \"about\" the difference between a term and its multifarious\nsubstitutes (\"a blind glass,\" a \"kind in glass,\" a \"spectacle\") or its\nattendant qualities (\"a single hurt color,\" a \"difference,..spreading\").\nThe unitary object is dispersed among words in \"an arrangement in a\nsystem.\" The objects themselves are commonplace\u2014as common as the\ncarafes, bowls and guitars of Cubist still lifes\u2014but Stein\u2019s disjunc-\ntive prose removes them from their commonality and accentuates the gap\nbetween object and description, \"(It) is so easy to exchange meaning,\"\nshe says under the heading \"Roast Beef,\" \"it is so easy to see the\ndifference.\" What links roastbeef to such remarks is the idea of\ntransformation and change present in foods and language alike. Roast-\nbeef exists as the sum of many processes, some of which involve cooking\npreparing, eating and digesting; it is the least permanent of things,\nand yet for the creator of literary still lifes, it is expected to\n\n\nstand in an eternal brown glaze on the verge of being carved. Stein\u2019s\ncarving exposes the fallacy in a whimsical rhetoric of permanence: \"in\nthe inside there is sleeping, in the outside there is reddening, in\nthe morning there is meaning, in the evening there is feeling.\"\nWithout knowing what is \"outside\" or how meaning relates to \"morning\"\nor \"evening\" to \"feeling,\" we are at sea, but by creating a larger\ngrid of specious comparisons and fake equations, Stein undercuts all\nlogical continuity. The logic is entirely her own, and the shifts of\nprediction and assertion (the very stuff of reasonable discourse)\nserve to expose the mutability which lies at the heart of consumption,\nwhether of food or or language.\n\n    What this implies for the act of reading is that there are no\nlonger any privileged semantic centers by which we can reach through\nthe language to a self-sufficient, permanent world of objects, food-\nstuffs or rooms. We must learn to read writing, not read meanings;\nwe must learn to interrogate the spaces around words as much as the\nwords themselves; we must discover language as an active \"exchange\"\nof meaning rather than a static paradigm of rules and features. The\nquestion is not \"what\" she means but \"how.\" If such activity is\ndifficult it is only because our habits of reading have been based\non a passive acceptance of the criterion of adequacy; Stein undermines\nthe model with the simplest of language only so that we may read for\nthe first time\u2014again.\n\nMICHAEL DAVIDSON"},{"uid":"MichaelDavidson_ThePoliticsofPoetry_1979","author":"Michael Davidson","shortTitle":"The Politics of Poetry","title":"Michael Davidson | The Politics of Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/021.html","text":"\nMICHAEL DAVIDSON :\n\n     For, as Aristotle saith, it is not gnosis but praxis must be the\n     fruit. And how praxis cannot be, without being moved to practice,\n     it is no hard matter to consider. (Sir Phillip Sidney)\n\n     Since any text, regarded as a mode of production, must be capable\nof analysis, why not start with the question posed by the editors of\nL=A=N=G=U=A=G=E. The fundamental problem with answering it lies in its\nblurring of distinctions between two rather different ideas: 1) that\nwriting \u2019\u2019has\u201d qualities intrinsic to it and 2) that writing \u2019\u2019could have\u201d\nqualities leading to a social critique. The former implies a study of\ninternal features. One might treat the linguistic structure of the\ndeclarative sentence as a microcosm of power relations in a capitalist\nsociety. The sentence\u2019s tidy organization of elements, its subordina-\ntion of action to actor, its separation of subject from object could\nindicate attitudes toward human labor and the material world. Or, in\nterms of larger structures, one could discuss the \u2019\u2019well made\u201d essay and\npoint to its implied valorization of idea to documentation, its\npositivist\/deductivist bias, its emphasis on communication over the\nprocess of thought as extensions of bourgeois\/technocratic thought.\n\n     On the other hand, what the editors seem to mean is \u201dhow can\nwriting be made to critique capitalist society,\u201d whereupon the ancient\ndialogue between formalist and materialist surfaces again. The form-\nalist contends that by radically altering the structure of conventional\ndiscourse, by decontextualizing, fragmenting, foregrounding the material\nelement of language, he or she will illustrate the lesions and gaps\nwithin ruling class ideology. The materialist (and reflectionist)\nargues that all art is essentially ideological, and that analysis is\ncarried out between base and superstructure in any literary work,\n\n\nregardless of intention. In its vulgar form, this criticism looks for\nstrictly economic, sociological \u2019\u2019content\u201d within the work. Obviously\nthe answer to the question rests somewhere in between the formalist\nsolution and the reflectionist theory.\n\n       Since I don\u2019t think writing has \"qualities,\u201d per se, outside of a\n  context of use, I would have to say that a critique of capitalist\n  society begins with an art that investigates its own modes of production.\n  I don\u2019t mean by this to emphasize self-reflexive art as practiced by\n  current metafictionists \u2014 an art which tends inwards toward a narcis-\n  sistic literature of exhausted possibilities. I\u2019m thinking here of an\n  art which is conscious of its own vulnerability in a world of attractive,\n  institutionalized solutions: an art which regards itself as a form of\n  knowledge rather than a strategy in its pursuit; an art that in assert-\n  ing its objectivity and integrity does so without forgetting the realm\n  of human concern. (I am purposely avoiding naming what this art might\n  be since to levy various critical criteria would only serve the\n  interests of an already imperializing criticism; obviously, every new\n  problem demands a new solution.) The lure of an objectified, ossified\n  art, working in the service of \u2019\u2019materiality\u201d does little more than\n  fetishize the realm of language and reinforce the dualism of subject and\n  object all the more.\n\n       But this dualism can be useful, at least in one respect, in that\n  it contains the boundary terms within which an interrogative (authentic)\n  writing may occur\u2014a writing which works in the interstices between\n  expressivist and objectivist modes. Such a writing would incorporate\n  the moments in which language loses its purely instrumental character\n  and becomes a mode of \u2019\u2019humanizing practice.\u201d As Marx Wartofsky says,\n  \u2019\u2019...(the artwork) is a representation of a mode of action which is\n  distinctively human...; in short, that art represents its own process\n  of coming into being and insofar, exemplifies and objectifies the\n  distinctively human capacity of creation.\u201d Art, considered thus\n  broadly, should still be able to appeal to an actual (as opposed to a\n  theoretical) reader arid might even provide some of the enargia which\n  Puttenham declared \u2019\u2019...giveth a glorious lustre and light.\u201d\n\n\n\n"},{"uid":"AlanDavies_TheAmplifierSilence_1978","author":"Alan Davies","shortTitle":"The Amplifier, Silence","title":"Alan Davies | The Amplifier, Silence | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn5\/pictures\/016.html","text":"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE AMPLIFIER, SILENCE\n\nLarry Eigner, Things Stirring Together Or Far Away (1977; Black\nSparrow Press, Box 3993, Santa Barbara, CA 93105; $4)\n\nI\n\nDiscretionary attention, fingersmake slowly apparent a-line-at-a-time\nthere.

The mind\ncreates of every meaning the sign of itself; but within this operation\nthe author need not be ego-producer; this is the meaning of text: that\nstructure produces.\n\n     Barthes: meaning is articulation.\n\n     Wittgenstein: meaning is use.\n\n     The text is the meaning-quotient of language; each text measures\nagain its meaning-value in structuration. The text isolates space\nbetween the lived elements of life in order to be itself recognized; it\ndoes this by thinking, by structuring. The textual structuration occurs\nalways equidistant from the sets of its possible choices and the pursuit\nthrough those sets; it poses always a horizon, the image of difficulty\n\nby which it is recognized.\n\n     ((A writer may aim to produce \"private property language.\"))\n((Writing produces, and is concerned with producing, exceptions to\nthe notion that its model is speech.))\n\n     ((An effort of writing is to alter the language such that speaking\nit has value. Writing offers the possibility of reproportioning the\nvolumes of language and speech.))\n\n     ((Writing distributes simultaneously the function of each of its\nelements.))\n\n     ((The larger the unit of language, the greater the combinatory\nfreedom. Thus, eg, prose promulgates attitude.))\n*\n\n     Roland Barthes attended the prevalence of the sign as meaning-\ncarrier; his attentions isolated the significant.\n\n     Meaning and concept combine as\/under the aegis of sign. This sign\nstands in the world as form, subsequently combining with concept, in\ncreating and maintaining the entire realm of signification.\n*\n\n     Text reads (me).\n\n     Texts read.\n\n     As critic: into the excipient body of the text the alert mind in-\nscribes what it has been the text\u2019s to inscribe in the excipient mind.\nThis gesture of mirroring mimes one of replacement. Each signifier\nbecomes something of a shifter; shifters are tautological, they speak\/\nwrite themselves, delivered and mirrored.\n\n     Reading acts text.\n\n     Each text rereads (me); recalls remembering.\n\n     The language is, its operations are, the go-between (shifting\nmechanism) in this function of trade, reader exchanged for text and text\nfor reader; this exchange of valuing is signified by the reader\u2019s return\nto the text and by the text\u2019s return to the reader in memory; it is a\nparatactic contract, twice signed for.\n\n     As the text\u2019s various signifyings leap variously and repeatedly out\nof it (under a duress of reading), it assumes a personality; it is this\nalternate with which the reader exchanges thought, as the text reinforces\nhim\/her to think. It is signifiers which the reading tends to distill,\nto make of the act a meaning indivisible. As part of this formulating,\nthe reader, employing reading, interrogates the text in order to be him\/\nherself disclosed; this is an action to seek the bounds of the textual\nenclosure, the limited world. The reader unites what the writer has used\nlanguages to hold apart; he\/she remembers what the writer was interested\nin forgetting, losing, loosing (to begin to think to write is to remember,\nto write is to forget). The meaning is the aura of the reading, a cal-\nculated advance on further reading which draws the reader on. Reading\nand writing advance, equally, the text; the reader subjects the text to\nthis furtherance.\n\n\n     The text is consumed greedily, because its failures are enticing.\n\nThe text is an agglomeration, read as a map, of failed exigencies; it is\nthe sum of traces of impurities; it is these which the writer of a text\ntends to forget from the language, as he writes. The reader disturbs the\ntext by his\/her interest, even as it is being written. In fact, the text\nis the reader\u2019s product, matrices of meanings which he\/she releases as\nproduct from the significations of the writing, which has been the\nauthor\u2019s product. The text, by its inclusiveness, attempts to choke the\nreader, so that he\/she utter no sound of his\/her own; it is an ecological\neffort, which the reader in part maintains as in reading he\/she confronts,\ndisturbs, distributes, the text\u2019s intentional unity. This is an allure\nof the text, that it is in reading disturbed but not damaged, that it\ndisturbs without damage; a faultless assurance of furthered interest,\nupon which, manifested, the reader capitalizes; the mutual debt of reader\nand author is disturbed by the text, which advances to the reader a\nmaterial interest it had not in writing for the author (hence an author\u2019s\nobsession with like texts). It is the text, synchronically a social\nmien\/mean, which writes its unity, a dimension shared, barely but totally,\nby author and reader, at an edge of their activity. This is the text\u2019s\neconomy; though it is full, its effects are not displaced even by the\ncoterminous attentions of reader and author. Even their calling it names,\nleaves it still. But the text is not closed; it inscribes an ideal\nsocial syntax, one without waste in relations, capable of uniting persons\nwho it writes face to face at its one side; entering it, leaving it,\nno problem.\n\n     Text texts text.\n  *\n\n     The text, puritanical in scope, within bounds, is not so in essence.\nIt is along the acultural, desiring edge of language that the text is\nwritten; its other edge, a boundary synchronous with usage, merely\nsupports, permits it. The competition between the two edges, a contest\nwhich the vertical of desire always champions, nevertheless furthers\nwithin the text an apprehension of its dissolve; it is against this\nlatter uncertainty that the text finally closes, a wheel in motion which\napparently stops, reverses, in having sped out of one perceptive possi-\nbility on entering another (writing, to text, say; or, text to apprehen-\nsion). In separating us from usage-language, the text creates in us a\ngreat desiring for same, which it satisfies completely but in quite\nanother way, offering in a cleansed language occasion the superlative of\nour own actual gestures in desiring. It seduces, in part, by exploiting\na flaw, an opening, in us, the separateness of our two languages (daily;\ntextual) with which we meet the occasion of seeking a perfection in the\nlatter. The text loses us, forgets us, from social language. Drawing\nus, as itself, out of the body of that language, we lose ego, we die\nhappy.\n\n     The author through the text demands pleasure for the reader. He\/she\n\n\nabolishes a consumption of literature by filling its vacancy with bliss.\nThe reader completes for moments the text\u2019s desiring motions, a completion\ninstantly reawakening, unsatisfied, demanding after this one furtherance,\nanother of the language. The text gives rise in the reader to one fear,\nthat of its dissolution, which would deny to the reader his\/her own\nanticipated dissolve into pleasure; this latter the text cannot deny, it\nmust keep its promise excellently. The text\u2019s economy is guaranteed by\nthe demands which must be met at its conclusion, a point, a vista to\nwhich it comes. The text permits a sort of necrophiliac pleasure: the\ndesserts of the dead, or at least constrained, social language are en-\njoyed in the instance of the burgeoning textual assault, an erection of\nexacting consequence in a relative void of diversions and difficulties.\nEnjoying the corpsing of a language, suddenly puritanical ourselves, we\nare somewhat repelled by the image the text supplies of ourselves aban-\ndoned in such pleasure (we giggle); against this social difficulty, the\ntext offers its pleasure, a hierarchy cleansed of social burden, a\ngesture completely filling a gesture. This is the text\u2019s obscenity, that,\nlike any other, it posits itself as a substitute for discourse, it ex-\ncerpts itself from the political except as a superlative instance of its\nnegative, a diligence of pleasure escaped from its toil.\n\n     The text comes from its industry.\n\n     The text is trivial only in its affectations, that it appears to be\nliterature.\n\n     The text considers its veils its triumph: an illusion.\n\n     The text does not stop to consider its edges.\n\n     If there were a diametrics of the text it would be one-sided,\nwritten.\n\n     The text is an animated perfection. If it fail in either of these\nit is, obviously, merely animated, merely perfect. Merely split.\n\n     Poems have dripped into the text. It is full of them.\n     Context, no such thing.\n\n     The convention of language is discarded for its invention.\n     The text durates. This is its relation with time.\n\n     The text is sentenced to reality, it is a contiguous figment, an\nact in an act.\n\n     The text repeats and tells.\n\n     The text is language raised to a third power: it is the (1) inhabited\n(2) space of a (3) builder.\n\n     The text, unlike its mention, is not historical; it does not disagree\nwith itself. But it is an authority upon its occasion. The text exists\nof several diachronic scenes at once.\n\n     The text sits on itself, excreting the text. It takes literature\napart, to be. The writing of the text is an operation on successive\noperations.\n\n     The text binds time to a contract. It does this instant by instant.\n\n\nBut time forgets.\n\n     The text is written along a vector between intellect (makes new)\nand intelligence (remembers).\n\n     The text satisfies by more than it was made to produce, in spite of\nits consistent language.\n\n     The text consumes an oedipal image in order to play with itself\nwithout bother.\n\n     In each text the language is decided a unit of space. This makes\nit complete.\n\n     The text is elaborate because it enforces an attitude. Obviously\nthe author function is not dead.\n\n     The text is a collective; it delights.\n\n     The text may be the last act of a body. Language will act alone.\n  *\n\n     The life is a text. The text is a life. Life, text, are equal.\nThe life, the text, cut equally from the world, and equally, as one, are\nleft. Each fiction dominates only in its own territory, \"succeeding\" in\nexcluding the rest. For the reader of a text, that text is all that he\/\nshe knows to be the case, but the author knows also that knowing, and a\nmagnitude of wider bounds that that implies; in this the author and\ncritic share, that they look at the text as, and not only through, it.\n\n     The life is a depository for thought, as the text is thought\u2019s\nwriting. Life and the text disintegrate for time. The life, the text:\neach revises, but by going on, never as an afterthought, never in re-\nverse. In the author\u2019s case, text, life, are alternate words for that\none thing which each seeks to inscribe. The desire of each for the other\nis intransitive; each merely acts, this acting is single, unadjectivised,\nunextended.\n\n     The body, its life, is made evident only through language (modifi-\ncation); language is evidenced only in the collection of bodies, lan-\nguage is inherently pluralized.\n\n     Barthes\u2019 own text is a figment of fragments: he took his life apart,\nand kept it there. Definitions he manipulated reappear: the figment is\nof continuity. A flatness is required of the fragments, or of their\nfield of signifieds, in order to overcome any illusion about them: an\nadmission of flatness. For this, a structure without systems is re-\nquired. A collection of utterances become any life: against this, for\nthe author a text is a remission from life, a forgetting-machine.\n\n     Each text is an appropriation from the language. This separates\nthe author from it also. Time is consumed because\/where there is not\nenough of it. There are enough texts (undemanded); this sufficiency\nparadoxically guarantees against consumption. The text is in need of a\npronoun of its own.\n\n     ((Theory is essentially heavy; bears at once the preponderance of\nan at least two-sided utterance; speculates at least in two directions,\nthat of its \"object\" and that of itself.))\n\n\n     ((To disintegrate (language) actively, is revolution.

It is a paradox that his-\ntory, the deadest of languages, speaks. Nothing leads us to expect this\nmis-giving away of material, certainly not the text, whose elucidation\nof the same material is transparent by comparison. Perhaps history too\nwill stop speaking, to be text.\n\n     There is a fluctuant, ahistoric zone between our need to utter and\nthe guise (writing) whereby we occasionally solve for that need. The\ntext is an extreme of utterance close to that zone, taking from that zone\na veiled ardor, giving to it what little definition it has. In this zone\nthe signifier is loosed, disobliged, given to be given, taken apart,\namong signifiers alone, untaxed.\n\n     History is the landscape of textual activity: ie the text bears his-\ntorical traces, but these traces are free within the text to bear precise-\nly and only themselves, unconstrained, a mirror against a mirror. And it\nis this latter lack of distance, this infra-closeness, which permits the\ntraversed but undivided text, the texting of histories, a superlative of\ngeometric progresses. The text is active twice-at-once, bringing to\nitself dispersed particular signifiers, and releasing them as one mate-\nrial: a plural, but singularizing, activity: meaning.\n\n     On the plane of signification, however, each signifier is entirely\nseparate, secluded. Needs motivate a combination of such as recognition,\nmemory, mental industry, which enforce the various plural presencings of\nsignifiers, a sort of failure of them, a letting down. The attenuations\nare marvelous.\n\n     (History is much shorter than the text, one signifier among many.\nThe text is much shorter than history, one occurence among many.) The\ntext exhausts history.\n\n        *\n\n     It is in peregrinations, mental or otherwise, of lover pursuing be-\nloved, that love resembles the warp and woof of textual fabrication. In\na beloved, in the text, an image is sought of an ineffable moment, a\n\n\nvertical duration within unhalting horizontal passage.\n\n     Adjectives merely circulate in the effort to define the affairs of\nlove or the text. That is to say, the notions of designation, of meaning,\nare subject to a furor, subject to that which animates, desire.\n\n     But to multiply such comparisons, such accords, between love and\ntext, is to damage the completeness of the surfaces of these two subjects-\nas-objects, a completeness made boundless by the play of superlatives\ninhabiting either (overlapping) sphere. But the love-text? it would\nrequire two writing-subjects, not synonymous, but coterminous: a figure\navailable as a delicacy in the text, but difficult of apprehension in\nthe world.\n\n     In order to remain outside my subject, I speak, and within this sud-\ndenly magnified spectacle (a world!) I stop to write.\n\nALAN DAVIES\n"},{"uid":"AlanDavies_PlanishingHammer_1979","author":"Alan Davies","shortTitle":"Planishing Hammer","title":"Alan Davies | Planishing Hammer | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn8\/pictures\/012.html","text":"\n\nPLANISHING HAMMER\n\nRay DiPalma, Planh (Casement Books, 67 Morton St., NY, NY 10014; $3.50)\n\nOrganized language is a trace of effort. The solidity of the lines is\ntrust; we rest in our work, whatever comes out of the heterogeneous\nworld formulating into this graspable world, because the structure\ndivides it for us.\n\n    The language is fragment. It is only a fearful mind that sees this\nas disintegration. This cutting is the very sign of unity, of solid\nexcitement, the sign of structure. The manipulation of units of language\nin durable structures, is literature. Though they may be interesting\nsingly, only structure justifies its fragments. The flaking arrangement\nof lines, of words within lines, and of line groups, convinces us that\nthey engage each other; they are made sentient. Language cut openly\nbleeds meaning and thus does more than it was supposed (thought) to\nhave done: its extension.\n\n    Each line inflects a gesture. It hurts surrounding lines, entices\nthem, throws them, hurries them. In this writing the gestural line is\nnever still, negative.\n\n    When lyric and imagistic modes are extended and intercut, the calcu-\nlations appear at each refining turn to be reaching for conclusions.\nThis reaching is held steady in their constant incompletion. The mastery\nof some formulation is implied in the turn to and from each line because\nthat formulation is present there in it. The forestalling is held\nrepeatedly before us; we see it as the subject. The advance implicit\nwithin each move is cancelled by its immediate repetition, but the\nimpression of the gesture elegantly retrying itself is the substance of\nour impression, is our involvement.\n\nEach stanza is three sided. This unaltered stability reinforces the\nline of sight we have as we progress. Our progress links the identical\nunits. Nothing isolate, nothing diminishes. The sturdiness of the\nstanzas restates, as each memory reinforces others, definingly. Two\ngestures move together at the point of each stanza: the gesture of each\nstanza resting straight, the gesture of stanza after stanza undiminished\nby our continuing perspective. Gyroscope and metronome intersect. The\ntwo gestures are, repeatedly, one; that is the point distinguished by\nour presence, stanza to stanza, the persisting erection of sense.\n\n\n    The breaking of the poem into ten sections provides the reader ten\nvantage points. Like Christo\u2019s Running Fence, at each hill topped in\nwalking we review a renewed architecture, in both directions. These\nhorizontal and temporary though repeated experiences, of noting what has\nbeen allowed in and combined, and what excluded, fill us also vertically\nwith the experience of disclosure; the world, the language, goes by on\nboth sides. The stanzas are strides.\n\n    This writing is vertical not only in the sense of accumulation, from\nthe first line to the last, but also in the sense of flight, the last\nline drawing (through) all others to the first. Each line is momentarily\nthe focal point of cross currents; nothing escapes the rush. Each line\nis targetted, washed.\n\nThe substance of the writing is language. (Writing eZZcvts the substance\nof writing, scrapes it together.) This is the case with works which are\nwhole. The work, by not travelling from the domain of its tools, has\nonly to perform itself. It is at no point separate from itself as are\nworks which employ one device (words) for the accomplishment of another\n(a subject, a discourse, eg.). Like filings held in array by a magnet,\nthere is no separating the force from the result. The writer does not\nhave to name himself or sign his devices, because the structure does so,\nfor itself, self-intently. Each chunk of language is a disguised verb;\nit speaks itself. The words are not a display, moral or metaphysical or\notherwise, they are a phenomenological fact, they can\u2019t be consumed.\nThe substance of the writing bears upon itself, and even this only by\nits exclusion of the eZse which its demonstration releases from any need\nto be there. Our metaphors (visceral, contingent, etc.) for describing\nthe substance, though they be accurate rhetoric, mark only our own\npresence and in so doing briefly relieve us of the work our presence\nentails.\n\n    The music of the poem is building block music, Its insistent addi-\ntions make its structure more visually intuited than tonally attended,\nThe poem sounds good without that being its intent, without the sound\nbeing gained and at the same time lost at the level of intention.\nLanguage, when it acts, works unavoidable sound. The sound excites the\nlanguage; that is its function. The sound is a function of language\u2019s\nhabit, something it displays as it enforces itself. The sensual phrases\nare not so much differentiated as arrived at; like oases, their appeal\nis scribed by the needs we achieve before we arrive at them. Though the\nsound is pleasure, the poem brings itself together not even at that\nslight remove which separates in our mind the sound of the hammer from\nthe hammer. The tooZs are emphatic; not \u2019\u2019their\u201d \u2019\u2019products\u201d.\nThe poem evidences some usual devices: rhyme, words in combination for\ncomparison, and the results of that, insertions from the surrounding\nreality of a transparent writer (a person we invent), lists of sensation\n\n\nor place or effect, a linear though jolting accounting for condition,\nBut the poem is more deflected than produced by these pockets of trait\nand habit. We are tempted to say that the author has produced this work\nfrom his own interiors. The text provides nothing to support this idea;\nwe must admit that we have used the most handy hypothesis, which in\nreality keeps us away from the poem. The poem has not produced its\neffects in us. We have produced the poem inseparable from its effects.\nSuddenly we (we the text) glance at the poem stretching about us, and\nsee bits of our own times, particles of our own natures, laced into the\neras between the lines.\n\n    The poem does not reach for an ending. This is not because of doubt.\nThe poem contains its conclusion in each line, each measurement; retain-\ning conclusion, it does not have to pursue it. Neither does the end\nconnect with the beginning, though it does imply it. The poem lays over\nitself at each point. By extension^ the poem.\n\n    From our place along its traverse, we need not speak of an end of\nthis poem. Summary is not important; a continuing summative process is.\nThe most pointed revelation of each line is its position. It is a marker;\nholds its position so cleanly that it is revealed, reveals it and so holds\nit. The larger meaning, that implicit in any self-supporting structure,\nis implicit in each reconstituted gesture; the gesture of line, of stanza,\nof word. There is no question of an exterior structure which we argue to\nintuit; words intuit, they trace, their argument is made instantly by the\ndesign they continuously perfect about them. Our gradual reading of the\nlines, our inspection, sees each locked firm to attention; produced by the\nclosest reading, this is the largest meaning, the durability. We don\u2019t\nexamine this writing against codes; it produces itself as discrete, opened\ncode and abolished all others from purpose.\n\n    As we read line to line, each provides a pause of recognition. There\nis an orderly list of noticeable elements, factors. The meaning comes\nout of the spaces fluctuant about the lines. The lines in relation pro-\nduce charges and discharges (cognition and recognition) (we are held and\nreleased), and it is this motion, this constant, that reminds us that we\nare in the presence of meaning. This reminder itself, unfiltered though\ngiven efflorescently from the depthed and screened filter of the words,\nis the meaning. Our implicatedness as readers completes the presence of\nmeaning and simultaneously neutralizes it. Its presence is its vanishing,\nand ours.\n\n\n                                                       ALAN DAVIES\n\n\n                   chatted the system\n                   evidence be\n                   some funny ideas\n\n\n                   no more chronicte\n\n\n                   turned embellishing\n                   in red buildings\n\n\n                  to fix a signal\n                  eyes half closed\n                  with a spasm of pleasure\n\n\n                   silence signature\n                  showed the bottom\n                  made deeper\n\n\n\u2014 from PLANH\n"},{"uid":"AlanDavies_PrivateEnigmaintheOpenedText_1980","author":"Alan Davies","shortTitle":"Private Enigma in the Opened Text","title":"Alan Davies | Private Enigma in the Opened Text | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn13\/pictures\/048.html","text":"\nPRIVATE ENIGMA IN THE OPENED TEXT\n\n\nThe trace of the enigma is negligently latent in all writing. The enigma\nis a colorless monovalent feature in textual omnivalence.\n\nThis present writing defines those private enigmas with which the author\nsometimes pierces his text. These are distinct from, for example: the\nnarratively enigmatic which, functioning, becomes through reappearance,\na character or figure of the text; the metaphysically enigmatic which\nfunctions, deliberately, through our lives as we return to its imperative\npoint of question; the enigmatics of dream which function, vehicularly,\nto let life ride itself; the grammatically enigmatic, which functions\nas a verbal irregularity, a non sequitur stunning us with what previously\ncould not have been said; the enigmatic of any single text, which is ob-\nsessive in its function as the ground for all text and all enigma.\nThroughout this writing, the word \u2019enigma\u2019 will refer to private enigmas,\nand not to the otherwise enigmatic which may frequently surround its\nappearance.\n\nThe author may plant in his text his enigmas. Whether this is more\ncommon in the rangeingly modern text than in classical writing is some-\nthing we may not learn. We may speak of the pleasure. The writer allows\nhis enigmas as, quickly they choose him; with reason\u2014pleasure. The\nattachment is attentive. There is pleasure in placing the deliberately\nextraneous, the stain. The enigma may be no more enigmatic to a reader\nthan is the rest of the text, which may seem \u2019of a piece\u2019, or deliberately\nand equally not of one. But for the writer, the enigma remains a sign of\nhimself in the text of himself, a unique entry of himself upon his lan-\nguage. It is that part which he obstinately holds to as he gives it all\naway. The presence of the reader is implicit in the pleasure of enigma;\nthe author is a voyeur, enjoying as he writes, the pleasure of his reading\nof his text. In fact, he gives the text to himself as he writes it: but\nin the enigma he claims in one instant the combined functions of reading\nand writing; he completes already, again and in part, what already others,\nreading, complete again and in part. He enjoys, in advance, what it is\nusually for the reader, whether himself or another, to enjoy only later.\nIt is a one-sided pleasure; doubled. The enigma is chosen as a special\nburden, a verdict the writing passes on the young history of texts.\n\nThe enigma cleans the text of its indebtedness. In the enigma gesture,\na text lays hold of itself. An enigma, unlike the rest of texted lan-\nguage bound to structure, does not (have to) evaluate itself. It is\nalready evaluated, it stands for that.\n\nWhat is sought is an enigma which cannot be closed upon (hence the \"is\n\n\nsought\"). Small particles of meaning satisfy this best for the writer;\nthough large structures do so, openly, they do so as structures, their\nclosure a matter of preordained interest. The enigma is erased in its\nminute duration. An enigma, unlike the rest of structured text, is not\nthe locus of any coming together, neither of a dispersion; it is a still\npoint activated, once by the author\u2019s enthusiasm, and again by the writ-\ning which surrounds and which motivated its inauguration. Enigma, made\nto be unresolved, affords the opposition of immersion, of argument: it\noffers an opaque exterior; not offering entry or exit, it posits (the\ngeneric trace of pleasure). The enigma, cued only to itself, faces noth-\ning. However, it is not bracketed. It is merely less loose among parti-\ncles more active. Though its delight is not extinguished, it has no ten-\ndency. Its argument is that, it, is, here; hence its relation to struc-\ntural wholes: the enigma less elusive, because more instanced, the struc-\nture less clear, because more over itself.\n\nThe enigma significantly animates (animates signification in) the writer\u2019s\nworking. In his text he lodges it, stills the agitation by posturing its\nparticular particle where it can be observed, contemplated, or where it\ncan be passed over; without having to reveal its lived significance, he\nreveals the volume of it. It is transplanted; without, however, having\nbeen anywhere other than on both sites, met equally in the imagination\nwith which they touch. The enigma is rendered siteless, a vantage from\nwhich its singularity can incite unanimously.\n\n\nThe enigma is the only anoegenetic particle of language. It stands, in\npart (and in part it \u2019fails\u2019), for the effort which made it so. It does\nnot sublimate its function to structure, as do all functioning chunks of\nmeaning; it is apart from function, embodying it at once. It is an action\non which the curtain of meaning has come down with finality; behind the\ncurtain, the perfunctory disclosure of fact. The enigma is a silent spot\nin the rush of meanings, but only when viewed in that context. Its place-\nment specializes it. Without being able to deposit its position in the\nmeaning-productive text, it does in fact speak its stance. It refuses to\nspeak in discourse in order to embody quick monologic impact.\n\nThe enigma is impoverished in context. It has nothing to do: no work,\nnothing by which to be covered, nothing to speak, no acts, no decisions to\nmake or motivate in its place (no pivot), no early nor late and no here nor\nthere. It has nothing to mobilize (after the author\u2019s delight), nothing\nto solve, nothing to begin or bring to an end. It abolishes, for an in-\nstant, what goes on surrounding it. If a text can be parsed, the enigma\ncannot. But it does not deny, it solidly confirms itself; its intractable\ndissolution of logic and sequence. But it must not irritate; it is in no\nway entangled. It is not a version of some other thing, neither is it\n\n\naverse to a possibility. It is stopped. It implies the release of the\ngame, momentarily, without bringing it about. It generates its instant,\nand deprives it of reason, of play.\n\nThe enigma does not exist in the tangled limits of nature. It is an arti-\nfact. It in no way approaches the limits of what we know to be the case.\nIt stands (in) (in the text) for the limits. It is an act of indication,\nbut without the masking words which elsewhere accompany such acts; its\nsubstance is word, but it leaps, releasing them insoluble, an empty en-\ncasement. The enigma is marked by its absence from the site, as it is\nseen to occupy it totally. No contradiction; this, the enigma.\n\nAn enigma cannot be plural; it depends upon its indistributability. If\nit becomes dispersed in the text, if it is acted, its character is delin-\neated in diffusion; of necessity, its still factness is destroyed. When\nthe integer is serialized, or valued, when it is perceived through hori-\nzontal or vertical loci, it achieves a rhetorical or narrative function;\nit relaxes. The enigma must not be made to speak itself in any direction.\nThe enigma, if it is to stand privately, if it is to release its pleasure,\nmust not equivocate. The enigma is the only detached attachment permitted\nto text.\n\n\nA text can be infused with a network of enigmas, which unavoidably connect.\nBut when the enigma is extensive, it becomes a particle in the text\u2019s fab-\nric, a code demanding, and enabling at least in part, its decipherment.\n\nAs soon as an enigma is extensive, structured, it becomes a term among\nmany in the text\u2019s polarities and excursions. It becomes one of numerous\ngraphs upon which the writing occurs, tightening and loosening. Its\ndissolution proposes its solution; it talks. And it is no longer private;\nthe text has begun to reply. The enigma is not permissive.\n\nThe enigma is consigned, ordered. It is the object of an action which,\nas a singularly upright subject, it demands. Unlike all other text, the\nenigma needs no support. It does not need to be there. It seems to be a.\nwill, to embody will so completely, that its it is embodied. It is ir-\nreversible. An order that cannot be recalled, it cannot die: its allure.\nThe enigma is messageless; perfectly balanced (of one \u2019side\u2019), it is the\nperfect signifier, the only one not drawn apart (revealed) by unequal\n(metaphorically inexact) sides. Stolid, it doesn\u2019t waver.\n\n\n                                                      ALAN DAVIES"},{"uid":"AlanDavies_ThePoliticsofPoetry_1979","author":"Alan Davies","shortTitle":"The Politics of Poetry","title":"Alan Davies | The Politics of Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/022.html","text":"\n  ALAN DAVIES :\n\n\n              politics \/ art = politics\n                  \n\n\n                 art \/ politics = art\n              "},{"uid":"AlanDavies_Thispredilectionforthemindinart_1980","author":"Alan Davies","shortTitle":"This predilection for the mind in art","title":"Alan Davies | This predilection for the mind in art | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/001.html","text":"\nThis predilection for the mind in art.

The wave that appears when the mind confronts\nnonsense is easily distinguished from the one that results from simple surprise, according to Dr. Steven A. Hillyard of the\nUniversity of California at San Diego, even though there is surprise in encountering a word that transforms a reasonable\nsentence into nonsense. He and Dr. Marta Kutas reported discovery of the coping-with-nonsense signal recently in the\njournal Science. This signal appears about 400 milliseconds (four-tenths of a second) after the event that causes it and\nappears on a graph as a negative voltage. It is called the N400 wave. The brain's signature for surprise is found in another\nwave called P3oo, a positive voltage appearing 300 milliseconds after its event.\n\nThe newly discovered signal seems to appear in response to a nonsense statement, even in prolonged testing, Dr. Hillyard\nsaid. Even after encountering many sentences that degenerate into nonsense, the brain evidently cannot stop trying to make\nsense of them. The special response to nonsense does not appear if a word is simply misspelled, but only if it is a legitimate\nword used in a nonsense way.\n\n'This N400 wave seems to be tapping into a higher mental process than any that we've been studying with ERP's during the\npast 10 years,' said Dr. Hillyard. \u2018It depends on a person having a sophisticated language ability.'\n\n                                                 The New York Times, March 11, 1980.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 45 years later that Heisenberg stated in a new theory of physics what Mallarm\u00e9 knew\nin 1880: 'A Dice Throw Will Never Abolish Chance.' Heisenberg demonstrated that you cannot\n\n\nmeasure a particle's speed and its location at the same time; out of these factors evolved a theory of\nindeterminacy, a theory of constant uncertainty.\n\nStochastic: (Greek, stochazein, to shoot with a bow at a target; that is, to scatter events in a partially random manner, some\nof which achieve a preferred outcome.) If a sequence of events combines a random component with a selective process so\nthat only certain outcomes of the random are allowed to endure, that sequence is said to be stochastic. Gregory Bateson,\nMind and Nature (1979, P. 230).\n\nThe Freudian theory of free association inscribes a stochastic situation: the analyst asks the analysand\nto speak every thought entering his\/her mind, the analyst sifts those thoughts through the analyst's\nmind, at some point stops the flow, selectively. Free associations, the random component; the\nanalyst's interpreting intervention, the selective.\n\n         One interprets, with fairly great certainty, a probable outcome; the position of the individual\nunits is relatively unknown. The relationship between writing and reading also describes a line of\nuncertainty. Publishing locates, within a historical moment, the position of a thought.\n\n         In metric reading (i.e. reading at a certain momentum) the reader reads the momentum; in\ncontrast, within the Mallarmean idea, one reads the space as a schematic which resonates between\ntwo sets of intervalic waves: one, the originating creative energy which generated the poem, and two,\nthe vibrations of the mind in the presence of the poem. In prose, the language locale is not\ndetermined; within the poem's determinations, momentum is very clear. What is actually read is\nscattered throughout the moment-by-moment information; the reading is continuously a prosodic\nfurtherance of the text.\n\n         The use of associative rather than fixed descriptive language keeps open the experience which\nis the original and repeated referent. If momentum were substituted for place, a symbol, a\nrepresentation, certain details of the experience would be left open which would be forgotten if fixed\nin precise and linguistic terms.\n\n         Free association \u2014 'evenly suspended attention' \u2014 is precise, working a wider field. The\nMallarmean layout of words allows for a wider field of concentration. The specific words of prose are\nnot determined by spacing. Satie's furniture music, though simple and delicate, permits the mind to\ntake it(self) an enormous quantity of places. Each Satie note is a pointer in\n\na possible direction, a precise and enjoyable structure of attention. Volume of attention is not insisted\nupon by the music, but is permitted.\n\n         Duchamp: \u2018object\u2019 language, \u2018language\u2019 objects. A thing associated to its idea: an equation\nbetween the object and the language about the object. Surrounding objects remind us at all times of\nsymbolic movements within. In the presence of objects, the two are never completely divergent from\neach other.\n\n\n         1900: the seeming enigmatic (the mysterious) as a different way of getting inclusiveness, with\nthe precision of all-inclusiveness. Over-focusing on the fixing of the historical particular, in memory,\nmisses the field productive of the original particular and cuts off evolution of new particulars which\nmight have come from the original field. A particular thing is the model, the example, the convincing\nthing within what is said. Around 1900 people began to realize the historical view to be a distortion:\nleave the focusing to the reader. Both, measure the specifics and, grasp the sensations and experiences\nbehind the laying-down of those particulars, to invoke the original experience, the originating state of\nmind. It is the difference between an exhaustive list of particulars and a schematic performing a\nnumber of exhaustive lists of particulars (which permits to anyone their filling-in). The power of\npersuasion, the power of giving the experience does not come from the photographic, the\ndocumentary, the 'accounting.'\n\n\u2022\n\nMemory becomes the place, the locus, relative to which particulars get filed (both senses). Filing a\nthing whittles it, by putting it in that one place. Fitting in, placing things between, relates to the idea\nof interval. Fragmenting produces interval. The interval has a place, fits into a larger whole, a larger\ncontinuum. But it is still a very specific moment, productive of an instance of pulse, a measure, like\nsonar, a metronome. Intervals pulse, inscribing the certain amount of distance that has been gone\nthrough.\n\n         In Duchamp's 'Network of Stoppages' (1914), the measure is inscribed as part of the\nstructure; the structure is presented as an instance of mental measurement.\n\n         Periods (and in the grammatical sense) of history: the envisioning that that would exist\nmakes it happen, the consciousness of periods makes history. Uncertainty and doubt create much\nmore truth in the renderings and findings; 'this is it,' the schematics, the suggestive things, the\nconnectives... by the time it is fixed it is changed. The act of fixing is time-consuming, time-altering,\ntime-debilitating; it shifts what time means, stops the flow (this constitutes the argument with\nhistory). A grasped history is lost when the concern is to keep track of it in a precise way. Without\nthe ability to measure place and momentum equally and at once, nothing really happened. Intervals\nare not confusing, they are allowable of confusion, in not distorting chaos.\n\n         The Egyptians personified in their pyramid building the type of consciousness that wants to\ntotally expand the scale of human time in the universe versus the actuality of that chronology. The\ntime becomes something in which human terms of death and life are altered dramatically by the\nexternalization of scale.\n\n\nTime is investigated in investigating the possibilities of the interval (Mallarm\u00e9, Debussy, Ravel,\nSatie); the experimentation determines what can happen within a certain interval, without spoiling\nthe composition of the whole: the point is made in a moment. The work assumes attentiveness\nwithout demanding it; the work values the other, trusts its reader. The work distributes not points\nbut the process of distribution; the reader also distributes the activity.\n\n         Mallarm\u00e9's mysteries, ellipses, vectors that aren't followed through or that establish\nthemselves suddenly and curiously in a place where they had not been expected, value the activity of\ntheir reception unrestrictedly. Williams' statement 'No ideas but in things' is rigid, minisculing, a\nlimit, a sort of advertising slogan. Persons exist in the midst of ideas, even choosing to represent\nideas. Interval gives an impression of scope, the absolute size of the idea, rather than an assertive\nfocusing on the self-importance of the particular. Because thought is experienced in intervals it is\npossible to move from the somewhat willed and somewhat random places that are reached in\nthinking, volumes of distance in space and time.\n\n         Around 1900 the mapping began of the variable distances with possible volumes of thought,\nto note the volume implicit in those distances which constitute it. The particles are wonderfully\nmultifarious but they change; the distances, the relationships, obtain for new particles, new\nparticulars.\n\n                                          \u2022\n\nThe lines composed of shorter and longer lines are the threads.\n\nThe places where they meet are the stitches.\n\nLanguage is the needle.\n\nThought is the thread.\n\nThe cloth is experience.\n\nThe places where the stitches meet are memory, are history.\n\ninterval: 1. a space between things: a void space intervening between any two objects; as an interval between two houses or\nwalls. 2. a period of time between any two points or events, or between the return of like conditions; as, the interval between\ntwo wars; an interval in fever. 3. in music, the difference in pitch between two tones. 4. The extent of difference between\ntwo qualities, conditions, etc.\n\nArt that doesn't push to where it has to go, that is more intervalic, admits of indeterminacy. (Morse\ncode\/ computers). It is a function of attention (see A Note Upon the Mystic Writing Pad. Freud,\n1925). The way attention was looked at, what attention had to be for things to be discovered, for\nattention to be attention, shifted around i88o to 1905. For attention to be discontinuous was no\nlonger for it to be an attention that wasn't rigorous; taken into account was what attention is, the way\n\n\nthe mind works. In studying people with neurotic minds, Freud studied what was fragmented, he\nstudied intervals. Neuroses are intervals, static on the line. Static becomes a part of the music; in that\nrandom component, for that part of the stochastic thought, enters the new thing, the other, from the\nother thing; from the other person, from the object, from the other person, from the other the other\nthing. The other must be unidirectional, not bi-polar.\n\n         At the sub-atomic level, almost existence, or forever existence, or other existence, is as much\na part of the regular flow as is the 'regular flow' itself. What almost happened, happened. There is an\nart which includes this blur, demanding focus: the level where the virtual, or the about-to-be, or what\ncame before, or what almost existed but without extension, is as much a part of measurable reality, of\nexperience. Choice breaks the flow, must be part of the music, is part of thought.\n\n         We know discrete things before knowing their names as objects. The object state is the blur\nbetween the thing and the word: the beginning to perceive that a word is getting attached to a thing,\nthe photon-like almost-being of either, is as much a part of the world as the thing and the word and\nlater the fact. The mind also sees the names as having discreet qualities before knowing what the\nword represents. The word itself is at first a thing, then becoming an object representing an object.\nThe words are early seen as also a world of objects. The turning of meaningful sounds into words\nparallels the turning of thing into object. As each process progresses, words attach to objects\nincreasingly. The process never ends; learning a thing and a name of a thing rehappens in every single\ninterval. The name of the object is not on hold. One reexperiences less as time goes on, as experience\nbecomes less new; one continues to notice it first as a thing, then as an object. In calling into\nmeaning phrases or words or language that is read, the process of focussing from the original\nconception of what was meant into, e.g., a conception of what the author means or, e.g., what is\nassigned as the personal meaning, is the continuous process of the intervalic. Intervals are moments\noff-rhythm between the identification, interspersed into the identification, happen as often, are as\nmuch a part of it as the 'it' is which is the goal. Art admits the blur towards which it was called into\nbeing. Keep it in moving, blurred-action, sense. Static: no static. Some of the focussing is seen in the\ncreation of the text (imparting an appearance of ambiguity, but) actually holding in the ambiguity\nthat it moved from in trying to eliminate the blur existing before the final thing was there. The blur\nis a bath into which the writer-reader relationship constantly dips itself; the bath consists in the\nmovement in consciousness from thing to object-representation, from meaningful sound to word,\nfrom morpheme to phoneme. Those movements are mimed in the writing-reading process, an\nimmersion in the development of a consciousness: the mind of the modes of writer and reader. Stein:\nthat genius is reading and writing equally. The interactive process mimes experience more\nconvincingly than a writer's giving of a script; rather than which, the intervals extant at the moment\nof creation, the original blur. The work is a moebius strip, a three-dimensional figure of the infinity\nof this process. The slight unravelling is experience, the further unravelling is codification; in more\n\n\nunravelling when codifying, remember the original unravelling more ragged than the unravelling\nthing of the present, capture more of the essential original unraggedness. It wouldn't be a moebius\nstrip because there are no continuous lines.\n\nThe uncertainty principle reveals that as we penetrate deeper and deeper into the subatomic realm, we reach a certain point\nat which one part or another of our picture of nature becomes blurred, and there is no way to reclarify that part without\nblurring another part of the picture! It is as though we are adjusting a moving picture that is slightly out of focus. As we\nmake the final adjustments, we are astonished to discover that when the right side of the picture clears the left side of the\npicture becomes completely unfocused and nothing in it is recognizable. When we try to focus the left side of the picture,\nthe right side starts to blur and soon the situation is reversed. If we try to strike a balance between these two extremes, both\nsides of the picture return to a recognizable condition, but in no way can we remove the original fuzziness from them. Gary\nZukov, The Dancing Wu Li Masters (1979, P. III).\n\n                                            \u2022\n\nLooking for the locus of something, defining its place, fixing it, also fixes an actual instance of time.\nThe locus is a specific place which fixes; fixing on a perspective finds a moment in history and thus\nthe unit of language in which it occurred.\n\n         Association occurs on the grid of experience: one pull is towards place which leads towards\ntime; the other pull on specific association is towards its meaning, the generalization that comes out\nof its meaning, and its structure. An association tied to a place or a mapping grows out of a pull\nagainst its meaning, generalization, and structure. Where and when a thing took place grow out of\nfamiliarization, a part of learning; generalization, the other part. The direction towards acquiring\nfacts and knowledge and learning, through familiarization, builds up a kind of transference to that\nstyle which is what is meant by the ego. The memory function of familiarization is historicity; the\nother direction of the association is towards its meaning, its generalization, and the actual structural\npart of the mind of that association. Each pull is a relief from the other's pressure and at the same\ntime a stress on the particular association.\n\n         An epoch in the life of a thought can be likened to an accent mark over a vowel, which is\nalso a place mark; it indicates a certain kind of place, a certain emphasis (the lines on a topological\nmap, grammatical oversimplification of that actual fact of height above sea level). Accenting occurs in\nthe same kind of locus as topological marking; the plotting of everyone's enunciation of an acute\nmark over the vowel e at the end of a verb would produce something approximating that thing which\nsays 150' above sea level.\n\n         Say place, names. Names place, place place, names names; place locus. Saying 'here's the\nspot' names it, locates it, defines it; it also establishes the who of saying it, not what is said. It is a total\ntemporal statement. 'This is Kansas but, not anymore! Now it's some totally other place. We're still\ncalling it Kansas for the sake of convenience, but it ain't Kansas no more.'\n\n\nThere's a place that you're going from and a place that you're going to; to get to that place, that\ntracking, is as worthwhile as the endpoint of going, because while you're going there you find other\nthings and those things are related to the final place; that helps to define what it is when you get\nthere. New combinations and connections are experienced. In finding your locus you redefine it\nagain each time, systematically finding new coordinates. When you try to solve the meaning of a\nwork and you examine it looking for that spot, this tracking is what the composition is. You make a\nnew grid to get there but that new grid is today's grid, a new place; giving you a new coordinate vs\nthe one you're looking for, a new name, a new meaning. It's always constantly destructible, or\ndeconstructible. If you view the bride of language as the seductress or seductor of language then you\nview it as the reader and the writer at the same time. Which posits them in the same place at the same\ntime, the text not so much a map as a median for that unity of place. Does the train for Brighton\ncome at 2:02 or is 2:02 the time when the train for Brighton comes? The reader and the writer are in\none place, as a seductor or seductress of language; finding each other, being each other, being both,\nbeing one, being language. On the way to seducing the bride of language, differing types of\nseparateness exist, and then a unity, then a new separateness, a new unity. (It's at that point that\nconfusion about publishing arises, raising the questions of which road one is on relative to\nproduction.)\n\n                                             \u2022\n\nField reading involves thinking about place in relation to meaning. Field reading relates to a reading\nof musical notes, to connecting the dots, to the gestalt reading; the mind takes certain evidence,\naccounts for it. The mind takes the dots of place factors (whether they can be put in an index, in a\ncodifying system) which are themselves a field which the mind uses to connect them; it is already\nassumed in the thing that is happening that the individual moments are not historicized because one\nneedn\u2019t later know their precise position, the position is only needed immediately, for the time being,\nin order to get to the more general picture. Nonetheless, the dots do have a place; one could\nhistoricize around that particular place and build back up from the original impression. In field\nreading one has both: you can fix it, or you can de-fix it later: you can fix it when reading or\nexperiencing it but you can also de-assemble the original impulses because the original fixing remains.\nThe individual elements are given as a field in which they can be perceived separately or in which the\nfield can be perceived as a given, as a piece of evidence, a fact. Field reading involves the\nfactualization by the reader of the given particulars. The reader doesn't need to remember what was\njust read but can also remember it in its given position.\n\n\n         The originating positioning is itself approximate, but going back to a specific particular or\ngrouping of particulars, the original relations are still maintained. It is a matter of scale. A particular\ngrouping in a text permits the reader to retrace the meaning of the originating moment through the\npositioning. Giving the reader this field experience provides the possibility of the mind's, e.g.,\nexpansion of any grouping. To permit this reading the writer eliminates the historicization implied\nby the impression that the particular graphemic points are historical; their momentousness depends\nalone on the fact that their position communicates.\n\n         Dada reverses historicity: the historicity becomes the meddling whimsical random element\nthat is consciously introduced into the flow of the interval, in a reversing of ego. Dada doesn't\nsubstantiate history; instead it presents an experience of specific random moments being what they\nare, still with specificity and still with the randomization. Duchamp re-establishes as one perception\nthe seen field and the meaning within the mind, the multiple levels which constantly pulsate and\nfluctuate between the two, allowing for a multiplicity of connections; a trace of specific groupings\nremains within that multiplicity, the shape that happened at that particular moment in history. Dada\nreverses the historical within chance, the random component, the indeterminate. The modem notion\nthat one has so much to do with what one imagines as having happened at a given moment is very\nmuch a part of Dada. Dada also saw chance as an element of history, laughed at it recognitively, saw\nthe problems of too much historicism coming from any one direction.\n\n         That which takes into account the aspect of the ludicrous allows for a distancing from the\nsubject material which makes it easier to experience. A writing unwilling to become ludicrous is\nunwilling to deal with its own specificity in time. The ludicrous permits relief from the awareness\nthat a historical moment is the only time which permits its knowledge. If the gravity of the moment\noutweighs the accessibility of the knowledge, that is the pathetic.\n\n         Field reading looks for hidden connections in two otherwise irreconcilable areas, often with\nludicrous results. A field reader makes the greatest possible use of any absurd connection between the\nparticulars, making unforeseen connections out of the apparently ludicrous. There is always\nsomething to retrace.\n\n         There is an element of the mind which reshuffles the signals it experiences, reads them in\ndifferent orders. Dreams and a lot of art perform this function, a function already built into and part\nof the blueprint of perception. In making an art that attempts to provide for a field reading\nexperience, one opens up to direct apperception the experience of that part of the mind which screens\nexperience. Field reading allows for the normal capacity of the mind to reshuffle experience, to see\nnew connections than those which were thought when the mind originally formed the connections;\nfield reading permits the mind to portray and perceive the actuality of reality as experienced.\n\n\ndistortion in the process of focusing is focused on minutely so that the distortions themselves are the primary focus forcing\nthe the singular point (the sign) to intersect the matrix of time\/experience\n\nThe constellation that forms the original pattern of what the reader tries to retrace: any point in the\ntext permits the other points. The splicing of two parts refocuses them in a different way; focusing a\nsmall detail which may seem a flaw or snag in the whole fabric, discovers the points of tension, the\npoints of most resistance. The mind, in its barest function, takes in the facts, sifts them, determining\nboth its own daily need of facts and what it must do next; it finds those things which have the most\ngravity. The mind grows and links to other things when the unexpected things are linked; it scans\nelements, processes them and in doing so, reshuffles them for another something which the mind will\ninvent. The mind evolves a blueprint out of what is already there, doesn't recognize where to go next,\nthen explores and enumerates the possibilities, a part of the mind insisting on making the ludicrous\nconnection. The odd connection permits a reexperience of what was originally recorded but not\nreally experienced. The mind (language) reshuffles its fragments in order to attain the original\nhierarchy; reassembling it permits reprocessing from the new perspective.\n\n         Language in its structure is the transitional element that is held between persons; it can't be\ndismissed. In holding language commonly, persons build up a protective and necessary conventional\ncode, as in all law, to try to equalize and stabilize and make as respectable or negotiable a currency as\npossible. There is understandably among human beings an enormous hesitancy to allow for aspects of\nlanguage that have been held in check, to change the code of survival.\n"},{"uid":"LydiaDavis_Blanchot_1980","author":"Lydia Davis","shortTitle":"Blanchot","title":"Lydia Davis | Blanchot | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn13\/pictures\/013.html","text":"\nBLANCHOT\n\n\n(Lydia Davis' recently translated Blanchet's Death Sentence\u2014 1978^\nStation Hill Press, Barrytown, N.Y. 12507, $4.95.

E. Cummings\u2019 first book of poems appears in 1923, when the dynamite of the movements of\nliterary insurrection at the beginning of the century had already brought down the dilapidated\narchitecture of traditional versification. The historical juncture for poetry evidences the growing\npredominance of a tendency toward systematization, toward the 'neoclassicizing' of a series of\nconquests, among these free verse, in one last attempt at reconciliation with the past. Committed up\nto its eyeballs to conventional syntactical forms, Surrealism would immediately get tangled up in the\nerror implicit in its own postulates, in order to carry out a revolution solely of content, outside the\ntrue structural revolution of poetry. It is the swan song of \u2018verse'.\n\n         Alongside Pound and Joyce (the latter, as important for the novel as he was for\ncontemporary poetry), Cummings is one of the few who maintain a healthy attitude of\nindependence, inquiring into the means by which to extend to deeper consequences, on a level of\nfunctionality, the first signs of rebellion attempted by groups in the opening decades of the century.\nTherefore, whereas other poets, with the passage of time, become more and more historic, i.e., move\nmore and more toward becoming a thing of the past, those three, with their living and open work, go\non indicating to younger writers ways to go further and providing 'food for impulse' for new areas of\nexpansion.\n\n         If in a critical-creative examination we seek the line of formal evolution in modern poetic\nstructures, we will see that the point of departure is a poem as yet very little recognized and evaluated.\nA fact symptomatic of its importance: its author \u2014 a famous author \u2014 foresaw in it such resources\nfor future release of energy that he himself expressed an astonishment that at first seemed\nincomprehensible in someone who had been the master and controller par excellence of the secrets of\npoetic art and craft: 'Without presuming for the future what will emerge from this, nothing or almost\nan art'. These are words taken from the preface with which Mallarm\u00e9 announces his last poem, Un\ncoup de d\u00e9s, first published in the magazine 'Cosmopolis\u2019, in 1897.\n\n         From Mallarm\u00e9 to Cummings, the path to be followed is almost a straight line, even though\nthe Dada-Futurist typographical adventures at least should also be entered into the computation as\nexperimental efforts. Nor is it possible to forget the Apollinaire of the Calligrammes. However, it\n\n\n   Translated from the Portuguese, 'E.E. Cummings: Olho & Folego' (preface to E.E. Cummings 10 Poemas tr. Augusto de\nCampos, Rio de Janeiro, Ministerio da Educacao e Cultura, 1960, pp. 5-7) by James E. Irby.\n\n\nshould be stressed that, even though he foresaw the new structural necessities of the poem \u2014 he even\ndemands a 'synthetic-ideogrammatic' comprehension instead of an 'an analytic-discursive\u2019 one for his\npoems and calls them 'ideograms\u2019, in anticipation of the theory which Fenollosa and Pound would\ndevelop some years later, based on a study of Chinese writing, \u2014 Apollinaire wound up, in practice,\nletting himself be carried away by a basically simplistic and superficial conception, in trying to limit\nthe consequences of the poetic ideogram to a figuring of the theme by means of an artificial\ntypographical arrangement.\n\n         In Cummings, as in Mallarm\u00e9, graph becomes function. In the French poet, the use of\ndifferent typefaces and of the larger intersections of blank spaces on the page, as well as the\npositioning of the lines on the paper, aim at creating a structure that transcends linear versification,\nplacing the poem in a new dimension of perception. Or as Aim\u00e9 Patri points out very well, in the\nessay \u2018Mallarm\u00e9 et la Musique du Silence\" printed in 'La Revue Musicale' no. 210, January 1952:\n'The use of the double page and the different type faces makes it possible for the poem to be\nmanifested in space instead of developing in time, without in any way overthrowing the dynamics\nproper to time: higher and lower, left and right, small type and large type, straight lines and curved\nlines take the place of before and after. Time, however, is not destroyed, but rather integrated into\nspace, as if, in this new spatial mechanics, there were an anticipation of a four-dimensional geometry,\na Space-Time: the dimension of time figured in space becomes imaginary and the lines of the\nuniverse made up of point-events take the place of oratorical movements (properly speaking, it would\nbe more like a wave mechanics, with its waves of probability, but this would take us very far afield)'.\n\n         Leaving behind all that in the \u2018prismatic subdivisions\u2019 of Mallarm\u00e9 \u2014 if we consider the\n\u2018verse line\u2019 a poematic unit \u2014 is still reverence for traditional form, Cummings works directly on the\nword, decomposes it, creates with its articulations and disarticulations a veritable dialectics of eye and\nbreath, which makes of the poem a palpable, almost tactile object.\n\n         But we should not think of confusing the path taken by this American poet with the blind\nalley of \u2018lettrism\u2019. In Cummings\u2019 poetry, words are not dissociated from their meaning, nor are the\nletters self-sufficient. The atomization of words aims at constructive effects having to do with the\nsynesthesia of movement and descriptive physiognomy. Beneath a superficial appearance of\nidiosyncrasy and anarchy, Cummings\u2019 tortografia (from ortografia [\u2018orthography\u2019, \u2018spelling\u2019] plus torto\n[\u2018crooked\u2019]) is, paradoxically, the correction of an orthography that is inane as far as poetry is\nconcerned, of a mortografia [From ortografia plus morto [\u2018dead\u2019]), and, at the same time, one of the\nmost serious attempts to make the verbal instrument function dynamically, by reducing to a\nminimum \u2014 as Theodore Spencer notes \u2014 the gap between experience and expression,\n\n         Organic structure, lexical expressionism (typographical gestures), disfiguring (not always\novercoming) the discursive \u2014 all these are characteristics of E.E. Cummings' spatial poetry, whose\nbest counterpart in the realm of visual art could be found in a Paul Klee.\n\n\n"},{"uid":"ChristopherDewdney_DewdneyTwoWorks_1980","author":"Christopher Dewdney","shortTitle":"Dewdney: Two Works","title":"Christopher Dewdney | Dewdney: Two Works | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn12\/pictures\/035.html","text":"\nDEWDNEY : TWO WORKS\n\nHOMOGRAPHS AND THE DISCHARGE OF CONNOTATION IN THE POEM\n\n      The outstanding attribute of words in a poem is their transcen-\ndence of taxonomy. All the levels of meaning inherent in one line can\nonly be realized by the polyconnotative recombinant interpretation of\nfixed terms arising out of the basal lexicon.\n\n      Polyconnotation builds up a static charge within the poem. Be-\ncause the resting potential of this static charge is at an elevated level\nin relation to standard language-use it discharges easily. (In the\nimprovisational poetry of the last few decades it seemed that this pre-\ncise attribute was the final irreducible core, the most characteristic\nquality of the poem.) The elevated charge consequently alters the\nlexemic status of the words in the poem. They become homographs (hetero-\n\n\nnyms), host to a halo of meanings, much like auras of St. Elmo\u2019s Fire\ncrowning the masts of ships at sea. (This deck is rigged.)\n\n      Hypothetically, the fabrication of a poem composed almost entirely\nof \u2019real\u2019 homographs taken from the lexicon would demonstrate the pro-\npensitites of the connotative charge. The refinement, distillation &\ncompacting of these \u2019heavy metals\u2019 of the lexicon should bring about a\nfusion reaction, entailing the release of enough energy to shed light on\nboth connotation & \u2019ambiguity\u2019.\n\n      I found approx. 175 homographs in the O.E.D., though only 165 of\nthese I found suitable (simply out of preference for terms, ie: I found\none of the meanings banal). Of this number it seemed only about 50\ncould be syntactically joined in a meaningful sequence.\n\n      The following construct is the result of this research.\n\n                      My Point an Order\n\nMy point an order\nin the drift of states.\nSounds steep in the rush above the bow &\nO the feeling winds!\nTo utter light & direct tender,\nas a bluff articulates the decline\nof our quarry.\nScale matter stemmed the rings.\nThe stroke conducted a current right\nto the ground bolting.\nA model brush drew the charge,\nsought console of the rest.\nPossibly a host of palms\nor the pole\nwe tend to.\nNot stalked or cast by lines baited.\n                                     Content being\nwhere the tear lies.\n\n    It is interesting to note the mathematics involved in the\nuse of \u2019in situ\u2019 homographs. One homograph can have two to\nfive meanings. General usage only implies two, though tax-\nonomically there may be more.\n\n    Each homograph alters the meaning of the sentence contain-\ning it as many times as there are interpretations of the homo-\ngraph. The meaning multiplies by a factor of 2 (general usage) with each\nsuccessive homograph in the sentence, ie: 2 homographs = 4 meanings\n(interpretations) of the text. The equation for interpretive combina-\ntions of homographs in a sentence is X^, where X = the meanings of each\nhomograph and the number of homographs in the sentence.\n\n\n      The final connotative discharge, (the transfer of meaning from\ntext to perceiver) is invariant, though the minor connotations can be as\nvariable as the number of perceivers. The discharge is a revelation,\nthe simultaneous illumination of the sum recombinant connotations. In\nstructure this process is analogous to a dendritic tree, or lightning,\nthe branches being all the tributaries of meaning upstream from the final\ndischarge. This is what is meant when one says \"the Poem always seeks\nthe shortest distance between two points\".\n\n        *\n\nFRACTAL DIFFUSION\n\n      In this article I am going to reify a progressive syllabic\/letter\ntransposition in units of ten.

This is how I started to write. I was\nworking as a waitress in \"Big Boys\" in College Park, Maryland while attend-\ning the University of Maryland. Always listening to people and was taking\nModern Poetry class with Rudd Fleming who really \"opened the door\" to all\nof this for me. I graduated with a degree in Recreation Therapy so the\npeople I spent a lot of time with were frustrated jocks and very social,,\nfun loving, good time party types. At the same time, I was starting to\n\n\nwrite, I got into yoga. So both of these (writing and yoga) were pulling\nme into two very opposite poles. By this time, I was writing more internal\nmonologues and stream of consciousness writing.\n\n     Last week I went to the library to look up automatic writing. I\nfinally found a definition in an Enyclopedia of Occultism. Automatic\nwriting is as if your arm is possessed and you don\u2019t know what you are\nwriting. You may write very very fast and so small that it would seem\nphysically impossible that a human could write it. Much of this type of\nwriting had to do with contacting the dead. When the writing comes easier\nto me, it seems to be more automatic. Stein was thoroughly insulted when\nthey called her work automatic. She thought it was ridiculous that they\nthought she was in a trance.\n\n     While working for the D.C. Recreation Department, I became involved\nwith Mass Transit, a weekly open reading series. Again here were these\ntwo conflicting types. I was teaching a preschool class in the A.M. and\ncoaching sports and other activities (hanging out, ping-pong, the local\nrec activity). Maybe these conflicts are what kept me writing. I remem-\nber buying my first car and how free it felt. Also riding on buses and\ntrains got me writing. The motion and optimism of \"new\" always set some-\nthing off. In the beginning (Lamplights) the observations and obsessions\nwere much more external\u2014not as heavy. By the next year with Stampede\n(having spent a year in New York studying in Mayer\u2019s workshop) everything\nbecame much faster, darker and extremely internal, until it came to a dead\nhalt. Climbing out of that with the writing proved to be a slow and thick\nprocess which even involved going back to Baltimore where I grew up. Liv-\ning out the same memories of childhood as an adult was of course painful\nand necessary.\n\n     The next work, \"The Letters\", was much lighter as if trying to reach\nout and be witty. By this time I was back in D.C. working various jobs,\ni.e., security guard, cashier, and receptionist. After being so self-\nconscious and internal in Stampede > I needed to be light, almost comical\nwhile writing \"The Letters\". By this time, a group of us were getting\ntogether for a poetry workshop which Dog City has been a result of.\n\n     To say the life is separate from the writing would be a lie. Not\nthat calming down would slow the work or the other way around. Lifestyle,\nwhere living, whether working would all add or detract.\n\n     About three years ago, I got a job as a Park Ranger on an old light-\nship down on Haines Point in D.C. Here was, I thought, the answer to\nmany problems (low pressure job, being outside a lot, on water, pretty\nisolated in winter and fall), but I found that the amount of time I had to\nwrite had nothing to do with my ability to write. I then started writing\nTomoka which I had intended to be a much longer work. This is the most\ndirect piece I\u2019ve done (more like a story than anything else). Also I\ngot married about that time, so here was another way \"not to hide\". I\nfound in Tomoka the language was very important and I finally understood\nwhat centering the writing on the language could mean. Of course, mine\n\n\nwas more of a story but all of the talk about \"words\" made sense. Certain\nsections are more language than others.\n\n      The pool where I had lifeguarded and taught swimming the summer\nbefore I started the Park Service was this huge inner city public pool.\nThere was a lot of slang and while we used to change chairs and clean the\ndeck, I would ask the other guards about the opposite meanings of words\n(bad meaning good, etc.). This is very common now but I always liked to\ntalk about it.\n\n      Now the popular songs that are blasting on the radios are these talky\nsing-song long tales with a good beat (sort of like Muhammad All\u2019s poetry).\nOne of the people at the ship would always know the words to them. It\nfascinated me because he would turn it up and tell me to listen whenever\nthey came on.\n\n      In about three weeks, I\u2019ll be having a baby. So my whole center is\noff. The writing has been much slower this summer, will see what the new\nsettled season will bring.\n\n(A bibliography of Lynne Dreyers work can be found in issue #8, June 1979.)\n\nLYNNE DREYER"},{"uid":"JohannaDrucker_ProcessNoteTheConnectionOrhowfarisitfromNewYorktoBaltimoreviaCalifornia_1980","author":"Johanna Drucker","shortTitle":"(Process) Note: The Connection (Or, how far is it from New York to Baltimore via California?)","title":"Johanna Drucker | (Process) Note: The Connection (Or, how far is it from New York to Baltimore via California?) | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn12\/pictures\/042.html","text":"\n    (PROCESS) NOTE: The Connection (Or, how far is it from New York to\n    Baltimore via California?)\n\n    MARSHALL REESE, Writing (1980; pod books, 3022 Abell Avenue, Baltimore,\n    MD 21218; $4)\n\n    Marshall Reese\u2019s book Slugs [published as part of WritingJ relates\n    through its concerns to the conversation generated around Bob Perelman\u2019s\n    talk at the St. Mark\u2019s Poetry Project in New York in 4\/79. Bob pro-\n    posed the issue in the form of two terms to be defined. \"Artificial\"\n    as distinguished from \"natural\" as applied to the concept of language.\n\n         Now Bob\u2019s basic rap, which is what leads to Marshall in this dis-\n    cussion, is that language, as an acquired skill, is one of those loop\n    functions for the organism. The elements of it are borrowed property,\n    the common currency of exchange, items on loan, as it were, from the\n    general vocabulary pool. It passes through the culture and we make use\n    of it in various ways according to our particular needs. Okay. In that\n    sense, given that language is all a public commodity, just stuff getting\n    run through the cycle, how does it get to be unique? And, secondly,\n    still be constituted of configurations which can be distinctly classi-\n    fied as \"artificial\" and \"natural\"?\n\n         Marshall\u2019s work is a series of pieces composed while he was em-\n    ployed with a printer who had a linotype machine which produces, aside\n    from usable lines of type, a whole mess of miscast pieces. It\u2019s these\n    cast-off slugs, from various texts (ranging from a Civics text to a\n    history of the Southwest with miscellaneous social notes thrown in for\n    human interest) all locked up and printed. By pushing the acquisition\n    process to an obvious place Marshall, using what in one sense cannot at\n    all be considered his own language, is nonetheless using it as his own\n    language. For sure this is no different than any other talking\/writing\n    process except his units are phrasiform as opposed to word form. They\n    evolve a context just as absolutely as syntax evolves automatically in\n    any word sequence (the absolute fact of grammar). There just zs a\n    logic of relation which is a matter of personal selection no matter how\n    \u2019randomly\u2019 the assemblage is constructed. Choice to do it is the deter-\n    minator of the form.\n\n         The conclusion here is that the concept of artificial can be dis-\n    posed of having any relation to the process of acquiring the elements\n    of language and put instead into an investigation of the use of language\n    which is where the selective compositional process becomes the essential\n    factor.\n\n         Well, then, what is artificial selection? It doesn\u2019t occur to\n    Marshall, cause he\u2019s just doing the work. The material\u2019s there and he\n    makes use of it, simple digestion. Likewise Perelman is ripping off,\n    coilaging, splicing texts, only maybe a little more self-consciously.\n    But actually, therein lies the difference. The self-consciousness:\n\n\n    what needs defining as the gap, the space between the thought and its\n    manifestation. That gap is the distinction between, the point of dif-\n    ferentiation, the point of isolation, insularity. That which is as\n    opposed to that which is not. So. Simple. Once you got that one the\n    point is to get to what exactly is. Goes flat right away, because it\u2019s\n    so obvious\u2014 it\u2019s the whole sum of those unique particulars, the choice,\n    the combination of choices, the mess of interactions. A settlement of\n    terms does not waste any more the energy to conflict over issues of the\n    process. Get in there. The slogan mentality: cliches of language and\n    fixations at points in the whole flow. Course it never finishes, never\n    exactly originates, only begins to be aware that it is occurring then\n    carries through whatever growth is. appropriate to the logic of its own\n    development, no, that becomes the logic of its own development, the way\n    grammar becomes an absolute fact of language: because the words are such\n    powerful objects they command relation\u2014or is it more simple, even, they\n    are the units and any sequence of units becomes a structure though, natch,\n    there\u2019s a characteristic there too. That\u2019s in a sense the constant vari-\n    able, of course it\u2019s always different\u2014what should it be otherwise? Is\n    anything the same as, nope, be glad about it. That\u2019s the tuck and lift\n    aspect of the turn, the quick leap into.\n\n       What happens in an immediate sense preserves its dynamic intact,\n  can be edited similarly and worked through similarly. The process by\n  which it happens, that rush of transformative digestion, contains the\n  excitement of any real process\u2014that is, its form is determined accord-\n  ing to the necessities of its function, so, it\u2019s clean, essential.\n  This isn\u2019t an argument for improvisation at att\u2089 it\u2019s an argument for\n  integration and conscious process as opposed to self-conscious process,\n  that\u2019s what. Because that\u2019s the artificial, the contrived, the thought\n  through first which creates a limitation on the flexible possibility.\n  Knocks out options beforehand, so, becomes stale in the act of its con-\n  ception by being such a finished thought to begin with. It must be\n  larger than itself and not understand its own limits entirely, at first,\n  if it is to be successful, and done with engagement towards the defini-\n  tion of its own intention.\n\n       The working through of any real process will contain a sequential\n  logic according to its own particular, essential dynamic. The character\n  of that dynamic, which it acquires only in that exact and self-same\n  process, becomes its own definition. It is what it is and what it wants\n  to be is what it struggles to become. The intention is not a fixed ideal\n  form, but a process of synthetic utilization and transformative integra-\n  tion. Not in the sense of achieving anything, no, no, don\u2019t want no\n  models of perfection, just want the dynamic process. It\u2019s got to take\n  you and keep you with\/in the process of becoming what it is itself.\n  Nowhere to get, of course, nothing ever finally resolves. Things take\n  form and then disintegrate to reconstruct, reassemble, rearrange in\n  another temporary configuration. The point is to work with that con-\n   tinual rearrangement, the redefinition.\n\n        So: the definition of intention the impetus, permission the cause,\n   dis- and integration the process with the resolution a new form, the\n   beginning again. And when in this process the activity makes a change\n   whose origin was not predictable from, the process of which was not con-\n   tained in the form of what it originated in, then, it actually is some-\n   thing, it gets to another place. When it all gets working it keeps on.\n   But, since like a combustion engine it doesn\u2019t fully realize, call that\n   total resolution the clear intention while the actual process is what\n   goes down. Always that remainder to be dealt with accumulates sufficient\n   significance relative to some point to act upon itself.\n\n        That\u2019s my process take, how I get from this to that. The rest is\n   all the details of engagement.\n\nJOHANNA DRUCKER\n\n"},{"uid":"TerryEagleton_ThePoliticsofPoetry_1979","author":"Terry Eagleton","shortTitle":"The Politics of Poetry","title":"Terry Eagleton | The Politics of Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/023.html","text":"\nTERRY EAGLETON :\n\n(The following is an excerpt from \"Aesthetics and Politics\", which\noriginally appeared in Hew Left Review #107, 1978,)\n\nConsider this curious paradox. A Marxism which had for too long relegated\nsignifying practices to the ghostly realms of the superstructure is\nsuddenly confronted by a semiotic theory which stubbornly insists upon the\nmateriality of the signifier. A notion of the signifier as the mere peg\nof occasion for a signified, a transparent container brimfull with the\nplenitude of a determinate meaning, is dramatically overturned. On the\ncontrary, the signifier must be grasped as the product of a material labor\ninscribed in a specific apparatus\u2014a moment in that ceaseless work and\nplay of signification whose sheer heterogenous productivity is always\nliable to be repressed by the bland self-possession of sign systems. A\ncenturies-old metaphysic of the signified is rudely subverted: the\nsignified is no more than that always half-effaced, infinitely deferred\neffect of signifying practice which glides impudently out of our reach\neven as we try to close our fist  upon it, scurrying back as it endlessly\n\ndoes into the privilege of becoming a signifier itself.\n\nIn trying thus to close our fist  upon the signified, we are in fact\n\nattempting nothing less than the  risible task of nailing down our very\n\nreality as human subjects. But what we will nail down, of course, will\nnot be the subject, but the paranoic knowledge of the ego and its various\nidentifications. In this ceaseless cat-and-mouse game, the subject,\nwhich is no more than the effect flashed cryptically from one signifier to\nanother, the \u2019truth\u2019 which can be represented only in a discourse from\nwhich it is necessarily absented, will hunt frantically for its self-\nrecognition through a whole fun-hall of mirrors, and will end up fondling\nsome fetishized version of that primary self-miscognition which is, in\nLacanian mythology, the mirror phase. Terrified of the very linguistic\nproductivity of which it is the endlessly transmittable effect, the subject\nwill attempt to arrest the signifying chain in order to pluck from it some\nsecuring signified\u2014a signified within which subject and object will\nblend infinitely into each other in an eternal carnival of mutual confir-\nmation. The literary names for this are realism and representation\u2019\u2014\nthose recurrent moments in which the comedy of writing\u2014 the incongruous\nflailings by which, in heroically attempting to \u2019refer\u2019, it will finally\ndo nothing but designate itself \u2014 is gravely repressed for the ritual\nenthronement of some unblemished meaning which will fix the reading subject\nin its death-defying position.\n\n"},{"uid":"KenEdwards_fromPacktheShuffling_1980","author":"Ken Edwards","shortTitle":"from Pack the Shuffling","title":"Ken Edwards | from Pack the Shuffling | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn13\/pictures\/017.html","text":"\nfrom PACK THE SHUFFLING\n\nAllen Fisher, Becoming (Aloes Books, distributed by Nick Kimberley,\n16A Burleigh Parade, London N14, U.K.; 2.65 pounds)\n\nThese sets,\"being most of place book IIII & much of book V\", return us\nto Allen\u2019s survival programme, already given a showing in Place Book I\n(1974, reprinted Truck Press 1976) and Stane (Place Book III) (1977,\nAloes Books), among others.

Bear this in mind. Twenty-five\nyears of psycholinguistic research into the phenomenon of the often\nbizarre twists of language spoken by schizophrenic individuals has yet to\nproduce a single undisputed definition of what a schizophrenic language\nis and what sets it apart from the utterance of other speakers.\n\n     But an interesting side effect that developed while these same\nresearchers were trying to come to grips with the problem of defining\nschizophrenic speech is the jargon they used to describe it. These terms\nare of some interest beyond their use in schizophrenic research for they\nalso describe certain common patterns in the way language is used in\nmodern poetry. In fact this commonality with poetic language has been\none of the chief stumbling blocks to attempts to isolate the schizophrenic\nspeaker from other kinds of language users. As one of the more perceptive\nresearchers noted, the problem is the same as trying to define \"Poetic\nlanguage.\" You may know it when you hear it, and can describe it ade-\nquately, but there are no hard and fast rules to set it apart from other\ntypes of language.\n\n     I offer a small list of these terms because they seem to describe\npoetry in a way which you might recognize but never really have noticed.\nI offer them with one precaution: don\u2019t confuse schizophrenic speech\nwith poetic language. A schizophrenic monologue will sometimes lapse\ninto passages that are pure poetry...with the same carefree play of\nlanguage found in poetry...but to treat it as a freakish bit of litera-\nture is to overlook the fact that these bizarre turns of language are\nthe product of a torturous state of mind.\n\nPRIMARY PROCESS THINKING, or \"unconscious thinking\" as Joseph Bleuler, a\n19th century psychologist, first termed it. Freud refers to this as the\nactivity of the unconscious mind in waking and dream states. This way\nof seeing is distinct from the self-conscious perception of \"object-\nreality.\" In schizophrenia, this interior vision often supplants a more\nobjective reality. Metaphor and dream imagery are two manifestations of\nprimary process thinking at work.\n\nAMBIGUITY is part of the double-bind hypothesis of schizophrenic speech.\nThat is, the schizophrenic, fearful of the consequences of a direct\nresponse, couches his replies in guarded, ambiguous language. In other\n\n\nwords, schizophrenics talk in meaningful gibberish so you don\u2019t realize\nwhat they mean is gibberish.\n\nCONCRETE VS. ABSTRACT ORIENTATION. Most ordinary conversation leans\nheavily on figurative language. A \u2019\u2019normal\u201d speaker, given the choice of\nan abstract or concrete interpretation of an ambiguous word such as\n\u2019\u2019concrete\u201d will tend to err in favor of the abstract. The opposite is\ntrue in schizophrenics who tend towards an over-literal bias.\n\nAUTOMATIC SPEECH or SCATTER TALK ... long rambling spontaneous monologs\noften with little apparent connection or provocation. The quality of\nthe language is often obsessive and at times seems to be \u2019\u2019writing itself,\u201d\nthat is, words spoken a few seconds before will prompt more words which\nin turn...etc... This is also referred to as SELF-GENERATING LANGUAGE.\nThe speaker is almost just a vessel for it.... COPROALIA is scattertalk\nmarked by an obsessive flow of escatological or sexually abusive language.\nDERAILMENT ... is the principle pattern underlying automatic speech... a\ncurious metaphor for thought...as in the train of thought is oft derailed.\n... is also sometimes called the TANGENTIAL RESPONSE.... a sort of flying\noff the linguistic handle...speaking in endless digressions... forever\nleading to nowhere...

In L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, you have tried system-\natically to condition and direct a discussion of writing in your own\ninterest. Now, in the 10th issue, you seem to have arrived at a thresh-\nhold where statement will embody dogma, and, to use your professed no-\ntion, mere conventional signification will just \u2019wither away.\u2019\n\nYou have confused a whole barge of important insights and deserve to be\nhoisted on your own petard. I can offer no more than a few casual quib-\nbles. Specifically, I take issue with the following :\n\n1 \"Mainstream criticism still fails to raise or demand an answer to\nkey questions about the nature of the medium\u2014\" Not true, as you must\nknow. The last 75 years has seen more keenly directed study of \"the\nnature of the medium\" than ever before in \u2019history.\u2019 We seem on the\nverge of a cross-fertilization of whole systems of thought\u2014psychology,\nlinguistics, art, politics, history, sciences, etc.\u2014so rather than the\nclosure which you seem to foresee, we are in fact only in danger of\nbecoming too insulated in specializations, in languages (or systems\/\nsyntaxes) so particular, eccentric and\/or solipsistic that we become\nsavage hybrids.\n\n2 Writing \"of reference\" \"mistaken for tools\" \"secure\" in \"identity\"\n\"becomes\" \"ornamental reinforcement of the status quo.\"\n\n\nI have heard you say this so many times in print that it is like hearing\nan old movie theme. Ido writing is \"secure\" in its \"identity,\" nor\nmerely \"ornamental\" except in a most specious way. I refer you to the\nworld at large for verification. It seems that the word adamant might\nhave sincerely unintended connotations when applied on succeeding days\nto the Ayatollah and Jimmy Carter. Language is, all of it, \"illusionism\"\nand to speak of any writing as \"secure\" is naive. Politically, all\nlanguage is susceptible to myriad distortion, realignment and significa-\ntion. That is exactly why it is never \u2019secure.\u2019 If you think black and\nwhite as signifiers have not changed in the last 20 years, or in the\nlast 5, you must not believe in gray. Language is in a continuous state\nof flux: though politically one may, in moments of frustration, conceive\nof it as structurally a paradigm of the constitution of the world, this\nis in turn an illusion. Words are not \"material,\" except in the very\nnarrow sense of material (or stuff) for composition. Words are not\n\n\nmaterial in the Marxist sense. Or in the Capitalist sense. Books are\nmaterial(ist), forms (literary) are material(ist), politics and audi-\nences are, but not words.\n\n3 \"Surplus value\" as a description of verbal meaning is nonsense. Lei-\nsure allows the objectifying mind to exploit a medium. Words cannot go\nhungry, but they can pass from host to host like viral strains, spon-\ntaneously mutating to suit the occasion. Marx wrote in 19th century\nGerman.\n\nAttacking \"the structure of the sign\" is like charging windmills. Lan-\nguage does not speak for itself. Precisely because referents are arbi-\ntrary do they fail to stand up to interpretation and risk \"meaningless-\nness.\" You can be sure that language will suffer the marks of all the\nstruggles you wish to wage with\/inside it.\n\n4 Language \"IS [not] the desire for meaning\" \u2014 it is not the desire \"for\"\nanything. \"Value\" is a word\u2014 language, untracked, does not have\n\"value.\" No writing is \"passive,\" nor is \"making contexts out of a\nfabric of markings\" a new definition of any discrete distinguishable\nmethod of composition heretofore conceived. Do you really believe that\nfreeform composition is a way to \"unveil\/demystify the creation & shar-\ning of meaning\"?\n\nIf you can create meaning (remember that all signification is ultimately\narbitrary) through context, juxtaposition, repetition, sound, etc.,\nexclusive of grammar\/syntax, then this will in no way impinge upon the\n\"mechanics of social control\" which are experienced only incidentally\nthrough language as arbitrary illusion because they (words) are\nconveniences.\n\nThe word is not the law, as Ludwig might say, but what we agree to do\nafter we speak (of) it.\n\nAgain, writing doesn\u2019t \"need\"anything. People need. I fail to under-\nstand the meaning of \"a pulverized normality\" which strikes me as painful\ncollapse of definitive intent. You have not moved one inch towards a\nstatement of that \"condition\" wherein \"form-making can be felt.\"\n\nYour equating syntax with a probably unspecified \"status quo\" in the\npolitical-historical sense seems uncomfortably like Lacan\u2019s Oedipal\ninterpretation : \"By internalizing the Law, the child identified with the\nfather and takes him as model. The Law now becomes a liberating force :\nxor, once separated from the mother, the child can dispose of himself.\nHe becomes conscious that he is still in the making and turning towards\nthe future, integrates himself into the social, into Culture, and re-\nenters into language. The father ... gives him a personality by means\nof a Speech which is Law....\" \"The subject remains riveted to the imag-\ninary, which is taken for real, to non-distinction between signifier and\n\n\nsignified : either the signifier is privileged and is taken in the liter-\nal sense, outside of any operation referring it to its symbolic dimension,\nor the signified prevails. The cause of this incapacity to distinguish\nbetween signifier and signified is the absence of an original substitute\nfor self, itself due to an unfavourable outcome of the Oedipus.\"...\n\n(Jacques Lacan, by Anika Lemaire, 1970, English version 1977, Routledge\n& Kegan Paul.)\n\n5 Hermetically sealed meta-languages? \"But in reality there is no such\nthing as an uncoded message ... It may be difficult to discover the method\nby which the decoding should be done; but once that method has been dis-\ncovered, the message becomes transparent as water. When a code is famil-\niar enough, it ceases appearing like a code; one forgets that there is a\ndecoding mechanism. The message is identified with its meaning.\"\n(Godel, Escher, Bach ; An Eternal Golden Braid, Douglas Hofstadter, 1979,\nBasic Books.) You had best anticipate the decay of your intentions.\nThe greatest \u2019writers\u2019 were those who, growing like a weed in the rich\nhumus of restive cultures, sang unconsciously (Carlyle) the desire, ful-\nfillment and disappointment of their times. We understand it on these\nterms only because we subsume it within a determinism, which is itself\nimpossible to verify in its minutiae. You have erred in forcing a\npolitical solution upon a process (writing) to which it is only tangen-\ntially related. You would be unlikely to abdicate your \u2019creative\u2019 to an\nhistorical imperative, especially since it must needs be (by definition)\nunconscious. Pursue your demons with actual fervor, but, by all means,\nidentify them first.\n\nCURTIS FAVILLE\n"},{"uid":"BrianFawcett_AgentofLanguage_1979","author":"Brian Fawcett","shortTitle":"Agent of Language","title":"Brian Fawcett | Agent of Language | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/024.html","text":"\nBRIAN FAWCETT :\n\nAGENT OF LANGUAGE\n\n(The following is excerpted from an article and letter that appeared in\nPeriodicS; Number One, Box 69375 Sta. 'K', Vancouver, B.C. V5K 4W6, Can.)\n\n     I don\u2019t want to write. I don\u2019t want to go to Eatons. I don\u2019t want\nto write here because I will provide in the activity of writing a rhetoric\nuseful to the maintenance of the status quo. I don\u2019t like the words\nstatus quo, its neutrality, taken (stolen) from a dead conservative lan-\nguage. Rhetoric... is useful only to the ruling class. The ruling class\nupsets me. I don\u2019t want to use left rhetoric either. They (the ruling\nclass) are byproducts of a universally employed process of exploiting\nphenomena for specific ends without having ultimate purposes, good or\nevil. In language the same process dilates complexity for its own sake,\nmaking it opaque, thus taking the power of coherent action out of the\nhands of any single social or political unit. We (human beings) are\nleft with an arid corruption. To write about the ruling class without\nfocusing on the source of power that organizes its activity & which\nallows it to ignore the ultimate questions of mass justice & truth while\nallowing Individuals the air & illusion of those qualities... on the\nthird floor buying a pair of shoes made in Europe, a black wool coat\nwith real mink grown on a farm...they would know what it is to be poor\nif there were words but words aren\u2019t here, and it\u2019s a long way to the\n\n\nbasement where the poor buy synthetic wool checkered jackets with fake\nfur collars. I don\u2019t want to be in Eatons...\n\n     But I do want to buy something. No, sorry, that\u2019s an error. I\nwant to obtain something of value, which is a struggle altho I have the\nmoney. I\u2019m on the main floor between the basement & the third floor.\nI\u2019m a bourgeois artist struggling to find value inside a language in\nwhich Beauty can\u2019t be spoken of in the same sentence as political or\neconomic justice. Wrong floor. Go to the eighth floor, go to account-\ning. There are no words, they are, like the articles proffered from the\nstore racks, inapporpriate, they don\u2019t fit, they are not of the materials\nof reality. I can\u2019t invent a new language, a device like the escalator\nto elevate me to the next level of meaning because the parataxis is\nbroken, busted, the magic of Psyche\u2019s house is gone, is immaterial, no\nstairs, entrances, windows or exits...and I don\u2019t want to write anything\nthat is not the materials of reality. ...\n\n     Nothing else happens. I made no singular error in activity or\nthought that lead me there rather than anywhere else. Nothing is that\npersonal. It isn\u2019t a question of the personalness of the personal\nopposed to vast forces moving like grand dinosaurs of 19th century his-\ntorical necessity, it\u2019s the similarity of destination\u2014into the taxo-\nnomic reflecting pools where...I don\u2019t want to write this, I don\u2019t want\nto be alone, reflecting by pools of sorrow or by vast lakes above\nturbines grinding the energy for these useless appliances stacked row\nupon row beneath sterile lights & lady in black w\/ plug in hand, beckon-\ning to me here sir, is a fantastic labor-saving device to help the little\nlady help you in the morning. In gust 35 seconds your morning coffee...\n\n     Says Trotsky: In a society split into classes, the democratic insti-\ntutions, far from abolishing the class struggle, only lend the class\ninterests a highly imperfect form of expression. The possessing classes\nhave always at their disposal thousands of means to pervert and adulter-\nate the will of labouring masses.\n\n     Yeah says Cliff. In Cuba it's not like you go to work for the\ngovernment or stay on the outside, as if the government is an entity\nthat's either beneficent or hostile. Those questions are answered. I\nmean, if you're an artist, you get a wage, you work to make the revolu-\ntion clear & thorough. You stand outside, you're not an artist, you're\ngust picking your teeth. There is no separate culture like we have, I\nmean, like off in the closet, where I can talk as loudly or clearly as I\nwant because it\u2019s describable as protest, or some phatic corner or other\ninto which eventually walks a joker wearing a tight blue suit & says,\nHey baby, you got a career!!\n\n     I don\u2019t want to write. In the guts of the city there is neither\nair nor a heart, there is only ourselves, choking in the guts. Which\nhang over the streets, wired for electricity and totally invisible.\nCrammed with cheap goods & ideas. The agent of language is lost in\nthese streets. In the springs of the heart. Sprung, like an old mat-\n\n\ntress, or bulldozed to make way for some further developments. I\u2019m in\nEatons looking for the agent of language and the orders of the heart\nand the confirmation of justice, without words of my own.\n\n      ... Our bloody technique mongering has led us down into the sump\nto the point where we\u2019ve become convinced of the verity of language\nthat is pure within so narrow a context of human existence its relatively\nharmless to the comings & goings of the real power in this life...para-\ntaxis, beloved parataxis, functions only inside the realm of personal\nemotion & the truth of our lives is that there is no public language\nthat can be understood, I mean freely heard without the control of\nmaterials being witheld. (& this, I\u2019d argue, is the real basis of con-\ntemporary marxism) So in the story I do something I\u2019ve been taught not\nto do, which is to invade the rhetoric of the left to see if I can bring\nacross what lies underneath its veneer. ...\n\n      I\u2019m deathly tired & ashamed of the absence of public language in\npoetic thought\u2014 it isn\u2019t good enough to press the conviction that if\neverybody could practice parataxis the structures that make our lives so\nawful wld crumble...\n\n      I think we have to destroy our poetics & our poetic techniques &\nstart to reintroduce all the active voices that make up this world\u2019s\nthought & force if we want to really practice parataxis. The parataxis\nwe\u2019ve learned is classical, applies to a world 2500 years gone. This\nisn\u2019t Homeric greece. We have to introduce the abstract & rhetorical &\ndeterministic & the mathematical & the vernacular. Even the buzz.\nWithout fear or hope. As if poetry were a dead issue we might reify\nwith that risk.\n\n      Emotion is a dead issue\u2014we know so much about its dynamics that\nit has gone into the abstract (you can\u2019t have read Freud & treat human\nemotions as if they\u2019re mysterious). What hurts about this is that its\nmade all the verity the writers who taught us sought not worth a pinch\nof coonshit. (If you want to test this have a look at any of Lawrence\u2019s\nmore didactic & less careful novels Elike Kangaroo, which I just fin-\nished readingj\u2014 his commotions of emotion & their extensions into\nlandscape is\/are vaguely embarrassing & dilettantish. Or watch the\nsame process on the media, where its all done from the outside, & much\nmore effectively. Id say the emotional is the least reliable source\nof information we now have, because its the most thoroughly manipulated.\n\n      Which leads back to my statement about the exploiting of phenomena\/\norganization of synaptic activity (or 19th century capitalism\/20th\ncentury) Both activities have taken from most people the power to act,\n& by that I mean to act knowingly. Most of contemporary capitalism (or\njust state control because it has more to do with industrial organiza-\ntion than anything) draws its power from destroying our abilities to\nunderstand our environment & the consequences of social\/political act-\nivities, or at least to restrict it to those areas sympathetic to the\nretention of the present forms of control. I guess I share with Dewdney\n\n\n\nthe notion that it isn\u2019t the existence of a \"ruling class\" that matters,\nbut a ruling structure that exceeds the power & understanding of those\nit benefits.\n"},{"uid":"BrianFawcett_FugitiveCauses_1980","author":"Brian Fawcett","shortTitle":"Fugitive Causes","title":"Brian Fawcett | Fugitive Causes | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn13\/pictures\/004.html","text":"\nFUGITIVE CAUSES\n\nLawrence Kearney, Five (1976; Tombouctou Books, distributed by Serendip-\nity, 1970 Shattuck, Berkeley, CA; $3). (The following review by Brian\nFawcett is taken from N.M.F.G., Box 5094 MFC, VancouverB.C. \u2014U6B 4A9,\nCanada)\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing out of the way right now. Larry Kearney is a very\ntalented writer, and this book is well-written, and at times, entertain-\ning. On the back cover Robert Creeley tells us that it is \"A primal geo-\ngraphy-with extraordinary intersections, wherein all the terms of the so-\ncalled world gain articulation and a place. And his propositions will\nhaunt you, or bless you, forever.\" What if I say, at the outset, that the\nsubject of \"primal geography\" as Creeley somewhat grandly calls it, is\nuninteresting, that it no longer contains enough intellectual currency to\nlegitimately make a book with? I then have to define & articulate this\nwriting on other grounds, without the benefit of the buzz surrounding the\nNew American Poetry. Unfortunately that isn\u2019t possible.\n\n       Kearney is a practicing artist confronted by what confronts nearly\nall experimental writers in the latter half of the twentieth century \u2014\nan absence of constructive context in which to think and write. No one,\nlet\u2019s admit it, listens to poetry, except other poets. The pleasure of\ncarefully shaped language, the marvellousness of the attentions it can\nproduce, the thrill just isn\u2019t necessary to the survival of the structures\nof power & ordinance in industrialized capitalist states. These things may\nin fact even be mildly dangerous to the maintenance of that kind of power.\n\n       This condition of poetry has existed for some time now \u2014 at least\nduring this century. For some 40 years now experimental writers have been\ntailing along in the wake of Pound\u2019s erratic political logic; i.e. we will\ncreate a revolution that will transform the world from within \u2014 500\nmillion little revolutions. During the 60\u2019s this in fact became an actual-\nity, little revolutions occurred everywhere, anarchically, & they even\ncaused our civilization to squirm uncomfortably. Now we have mass-produced\n\n\ntarot cards, our horoscopes & biorhythyms are helpfully set out for us in\nthe morning papers, and while the rich still mingle mostly with the rich,\nnow they do it by going away two or three times a year to feel each other\nup for a weekend. We\u2019ve been given back primal existence if we want it and\nthe stuff of Pound & Olson\u2019s revolution is now being merchandised like any\nother commodity. In the face of it, most poets have simply retreated fur-\nther into the obscurities of poetic & personal processes, and into the kind\nof despair out of which Kearney\u2019s writing seems to come. \"1 don\u2019t know what\nto make. I don\u2019t know what I want. I don\u2019t know why I ate so much break-\nfast.\" he says or \"At two-thirty in the fucking a.m. who\u2019s selling cars\non the tube. The problems of the world are insurmountable and I feel like\ncrying.\"\n\n       Again and again, Kearney\u2019s writing confronts that point, or is\nconfronted by it, so that the sheer number of the confrontations becomes\nthe organizing force in the writing. Yet Kearney doesn\u2019t seem to want to\ntake responsibility for his part in the confrontations. They remain\nexistential. At one point he warns his reader that \"There isn\u2019t anything\nyou need here except sleep.\" More important, he\u2019s completely uncritical\nof the mumbo-jumbo that has grown up around poetic process, allowing the\nmisty prounouncements and\/or vectors of language it creates to become an\nalternative to an enterable world reality. \"We don\u2019t carry worlds on our\nbacks.\" he tells us. \"They lie back there, warping and shifting.\" and\nlater in the book, he makes this proposition: \"What it comes down to,\nforms decay. There isn\u2019t anything but content.\" The trouble with that,\nas the writing abundantly identifies, is that when forms decay, content\nhas neither context nor boundaries to define its value, and one is forced\nto internalize everything: ergo, \"Primal Geography\". But, when you take\nfrom it the buzz, \"Primal Geography\" just means individual and idiosyn-\ncratic taxonomy, and passively psychological enterprise. \"Nothing to say\nuntil it\u2019s there and then it says it or refuses and smiles at you. I don\u2019t\nknow what the point is. Getting fucked.\" Later, Kearney notices a corol-\nlary phenomenon: \"There always seems to be someone waiting around to be\nfucked.\" At least the sexual metaphor makes him nervous, which means he\u2019s\nfrom the present generation, and not Greeley\u2019s, which never got beyond\ntaking advantage of it.\n\n       Kearney\u2019s approach to poetry and to the world generally is revealed\nin the following admission:\n\n       I LEARNT FROM HIM THAT POETRY, EVEN THAT OF THE LOFTIEST AND,\n       SEEMINGLY, THAT OF THE WILDEST ODES HAD A LOGIC OF ITS OWN, AS\n       SEVERE AS THAT OF SCIENCE, AND MORE DIFFICULT, BECAUSE MORE SUBTLE,\n       MORE COMPLEX, AND DEPENDENT ON MORE AND MORE FUGITIVE CAUSES.\n\n       Kearney learned that from, I think, Jack Spicer, but he could have\nlearned it from any of a dozen major poets of the New American Poetry.\n\n\nI learned it too, and so did most of the writers I could name. And I\nbelieve it too. My question, of Kearney, and of anyone else who I\u2019ve ever\nlearned anything about poetry from is this: What in the fuck am I suppos-\ned to do with it?\n\n       Translated into practice, the methodology of the New American\nPoetry has aged into a closed form that is causing poetry to disappear\ninto second rate motivational and behavioral psychology. If the causes\nof poetry are fugitive, we need to re-open the discourse over what are\nand why are the effects of its causes. In general poets have lost the\ntools with which to be responsive to anything but \"primal geography\" and\nworse, they\u2019ve lost sight of the fact that we\u2019re fucking well responsible\nto the condition of the planet and of the human species from which, after,\nall, poetry is derived. Which is not to rebuke the loveliness of this writ-\ning, the marvelousness of the attentions and what they produce. This, as al-\nways, should be given to more human beings. But how do you teach that,\nwithout placing it in a context of basic human needs that will also ensure\nthat human beings, with the knowledges poetry offers, will also be able\nto fill their bellies, protect their young, & assuage the need for dignity\nthat underlies, or undercuts, our political lives?\n\nBRIAN FAWCETT\n"},{"uid":"RichardForeman_TryingtoBeCenteredOntheCircumference_1978","author":"Richard Foreman","shortTitle":"Trying to Be Centered \u2026 On the Circumference","title":"Richard Foreman | Trying to Be Centered \u2026 On the Circumference | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn4\/pictures\/016.html","text":"\n            TRYING TO BE CENTERED ...

A reverberation machine! ...\n\n The theme is to document in the plays a certain kind of \u2019constructed\u2019\nbehavior (my invention) in which mentation, mental-acts, take place on\nan outside surface...not hidden away inside. Thinking as the product\nof field-interchange. ...\n\n So there isn\u2019t progression or development (19th century ediface complex:\nimpressive what man can do) there is rather - like the electron - a\n\u2019being potentially present\u2019 in many places at once.

POLYPHONIC MUSIC....not the\ndevelopment from cell to cell, but.... continual thematic modulation....\nlisten vertically. ... a certain kind of attention, like a cloud of\nagitated particles,... leaving the trace.\n\n To create that field (rather than allowing consciousness to be hypnotized)\nmy plays keep \u2019changing the subject\u2019. But is it changed? Since the\nsubject is the field, not spoken of directly, but articulated, layed out,\nby the writing of \u2019things\u2019\n\n      The pleasure I take (writing) is the pleasure of intercutting:\n      interrupting: an impulse I want to (and do) make. The impulse\n      is registered, but allowed to twist, turn, block itself, so that\n      blockage, that reaction to its energy, produces a detour, and the\n\n\n                                                                                  I\n     original impulse maps new, contradictory territory. ...\n\nOn purpose, on the root level of expression-of-impulse, I try to get into\nthe greatest difficulty possible. Syntactically, logically, rationally,\nnarratively. \u2019Train-of-thought\u2019 trouble and blockage is cultivated.\nThe center of the work is in that trouble, stumbling, drift, in that\nresistance to all \u2019effort\u2019 which is, I maintain, the source of all\nreflexivity. That \"coming up against things\" which is the experience\nthat forces us to \"see\". ...\n\n\nMy plays, therefore, postulate, for me, a PARADISE where the \u2019allowed\u2019\nmental move is the move to undercut all impulses, to self-block, to\nstrategically change the subject, so that a desired emotion is produced....\n\nA profound undertaking, but the word profound must be replaced, so that\nwe no longer follow its lead in thinking that the ultimate is a matter of\n\u2019depth\u2019 - but come to understand it as a matter of wideness, greater and\ngreater distribution of the self over the spread network of what is\navailable, the web of everything interrupting everything else upon that\nsurface over which our lives are always wandering.\n\nTherefore, when it seems that my plays, line by line, are changing the\nsubject, that is true - but that changing of subject is the ground of the\nreal subject, an openness and alertness resulting from a \"non-human\"\n(post-humanistic) wandering over the whole field of everything-that-is-\ndiscoursing to us. ...\n\n\n                                                  RICHARD FOREMAN\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"uid":"SteveFraccaro_NonPoetry_1979","author":"Steve Fraccaro","shortTitle":"Non-Poetry","title":"Steve Fraccaro | Non-Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/020.html","text":"\n    STEVE FRACCARO :\n\n    Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology.

Quintessential Architecture\n\nThe potential of \u2018quintessential architecture\u2019 is to be realized through effacing the meaning of the\nreality which has arisen as a result of architecture's degeneration into a false vision, exclusively\ndetermined by utility and universality. In other words, architecture today is blinded with geometric\ngrid patterns which in themselves do not generate meaning, and these reject and repress the meaning\nwhich exists in the very medium itself, in the structuring process by which architecture is organized\non the basis of utility and convention.\n\nThis, of course, results in the creation of impersonal conditions which eliminate emotional life and\nstrongly accentuate the impression of sterility in our period. We are witness to the self-fulfilling\nprophecy of a sterile age determined to be sterile. The re-evaluation of architecture in this context is\ndesigned to induce an act of self-transformation on the part of [humans].\n\nThis 'act of self-transformation' is obviously an act that concerns [human] subjectivity and is possible\nonly by means of generating meaning through the self. Meaning emerges in relation to the character\nof a given object when the object is contemplated in its relationship to the self. Thus, meaning\ndenotes the relationship in which an object stands to the subject, and not the character of the object\nitself. For example, a given object may be' good' for me, but not for another. The quality of the\nobject, then, constitutes the meaning of the object to the subject. This means that when we deal with\nan object, it will naturally assume a meaning for us so long as it is posited in a way that engages us.\nIndeed we may argue that an existential relationship to an object occurs as soon as it presents us with\na meaning.\n\nOne thing that I would like to clarify at this point is that when I propose to 'efface meaning,' I do\nnot set out to completely efface all meaning. The act of elimination is restricted to transcendental\nmeaning; that is to say to a meaning which inhibits or disrupts the aforementioned existential\n\n\n* Excerpted from A New Wave of Japanese Architecture (1978, The Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, Catalogue\n10).\n\n\nrelationship \u2014 for example, conventional meaning, practical meaning, or meaning as an instrument\nof a particular message.\n\nThe transcendental insures intellectual cognition. It is a meaning which is supported by an objective\nsense of the appropriate, which in its turn constitutes an absolute standard in the context of reality.\nWhat counts is whether the available meaning satisfies this appropriateness which is in itself\nindependent of our personal feelings.\n\nBefore this objective system, our feelings are deprived of all their power. In order to judge the\nmeaning of things in light of criteria prescribed by an objective system, we enclose ourselves in\nparentheses; we only seek the cognate of an appropriate objectivity. But meaning can only be\nobtained in this manner through relinquishing the self. There may be appropriate cognition here, but\nthe eye of the subject capable of reading the meaning is patently absent.\n\n... The elimination of transcendental meaning through exclusion will restore the self and lead to a\nconfirmation of meaning based on a coexistence with that self. Thus the first task is to eliminate\ntranscendental meaning for the sake of restoring existential meaning .\n\n'All paths are blocked, and yet we must act. It is then that we set out to change the world. That is to\nsay, we try to live in the world as if the relationship between objects and our subconscious awareness\nof them were a determinist process. That is to say, we transform ourselves for the very purpose for\nwhich consciousness proposes to transform the object' (Sartre) .\n\nGeometry is antecedent to our existence and while it may serve to elucidate the structure of actual\nspace, it has nothing to say about it.\n\nWhile geometry, like language and mathematics, provides a set of principles responsible for logical\nconstruction, it has no specific commitment to reality. Its interior is empty so to speak. Once made\nthe object of cognition, however, this void, just like language and mathematics, posits a logical\ncomposition with regard to the creation of actual space as a structural entity .\n\nThe act of understanding presupposes the functioning of the ego as a subject, but a modified attitude\nwould imply the subject's absence, that is, a negation of autonomy. The subject deprived of\nindependence as a self has no choice but to enter the world of senses, where cognitive sensation is the\nonly effective guide. In the end the subject is left drifting purposelessly before the internal destitution\nof the object. This benumbed state may be reinforced by \u2018repetition,\u2019 \u2018multi-tiered structures\u2019\n\n\n\u2018distance\u2019 and \u2018divergence.\u2019 The \u2018repetition\u2019 in question depends upon the reiteration of similar\ngraphic forms; for example, the quasi-quadratic elements that repeatedly appear in the walls of certain\nspace compositions .... The repetition itself causes these hollow forms to sink into our senses in an\nundigested state; simple graphic forms, like foreign substances that are never digested; they remain\nunmodified as they drift into our consciousness. They persistently appear and reappear until the\nprinciple that governs them is perceived as a notion, or even as a tangible reality. This notion will\nbegin to be felt as a physical object. Here we are already in a realm where architecture is no longer\nrepresentable in terms of 'what architecture is. 'It exists only in its own right as a tangible, concrete\nobject .... Thus, the self which drifts about in the hollow interior of the object because of the loss of\nits perceptual identity will eventually be captured by the concretized notion and find itself pinned in\nmid-air. And this very state of suspension in mid-air is what provides the key to the restoration of the\nself which the hollow object has hitherto denied. The emergence of the self here brings into view the\nself which has been outside of consideration in the process of objective cognition, that very self\nwhich, while remaining mesmerized by the notion, will continue to generate new semantic value.\n\n"},{"uid":"ArtieGold_ReviewsandNotes_1980","author":"Artie Gold","shortTitle":"Reviews and Notes","title":"Artie Gold | Reviews and Notes | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/016.html","text":"\nCHRISTOPHER DEWDNEY, Natural History of Southwestern Ontario: A Palaezoic\nGeology of London Ontario (1973; The Coach House Press, 401 (rear) Huron\nStreet, Toronto, Ontario; $3), Fovea Centralis (1975; Coach House; $4),\nSpring Traces in the Control Emerald Night (1978; The Figures, c\/o SPD,\n1636 Ocean View, Kensington, CA 94707; $2.50)\n\nRecall control metaphor eidetically spinning Shantung silken fibres w\/\nstray filtered scents of Sillurian coalmeasures syntax synaptically\nBurroughstan.\n\n\n        ARTIE GOLD"},{"uid":"MichaelGottlieb_DolchWords_1978","author":"Michael Gottlieb","shortTitle":"Dolch Words","title":"Michael Gottlieb | Dolch Words | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn2\/pictures\/019.html","text":"\n\n  DOLCH WORDS\n\n  Kit Robinson, The Polch Stanzas (1976; $1 from This Press, 326\n  Connecticut, San Francisco, CA 94107)\n\n\n  Dr. Edward Dolch, dear to all reading teachers, in his class Manual for\n  Remedial Reading, came up with a list of words, 220 words, which he\n  estimated accounted for 1\/2 to 3\/4 of all school reading matter, words\n  which by the third grade everyone is expected to recognize instantly by\n  sight.

To the extent that there is a set of repeating signatures, one\nlearns to recognize as appertaining to something that could be called a\nGreenwald poem, it has always seemed as likely as not to have developed as\na part of an emergent style, or voice, or writerly persona, more or less\nconnected to an actual person, in New York, with a certain Queens accent,\nwho was to be seen, or not, at certain places around town. Admittedly\nsuch recognitions (this, here, is a Greenwald...e.g.) arose not only out\nof some more selfed armature of presentation to the exclusion of familiari-\nties in other aspects of the writing. A somewhat socialized urbanized\n\u00b9 relaxed\u2079 mode of discourse could have been held up, as epitomizing, as\nan hypothetical model, and matched with a similar more formal contextual\nfocus: continuities of relationships, friendships, lovers, bars, parties,\nevenings at home. This sort of identification came with the accrued pres-\nence of the writer and his work on the horizon so that, eventually, there\nseemed to be something that in being called a Greenwald, for example, as\nstyle, appeared as a realized thing which could conceivably span, comfor-\ntably, almost any exigency of subject and still reside, undeniably, as a\nwork by this author.\n\n\nIn part the not inconsiderable effect of reading a book like Use No Hooks\nseems due to the way one\u2019s expectations of a writer midpoint in his career\nare destroyed\u2014through, and as, the structure of the poems themselves are\ntorn and ripped and pressed and pushed to the edge of organized utterance\nrecognizable as the writer\u2019s parameters,\u2014and beyond. The envelope is\nthoroughly reconstituted. Edges are sheared off or repeat like a monitor\u2019s\nrollover. Often the face of the prosody is stripped past the stratum of\nconsensual artifice, deeper than the bones of the sentence, to a ledge of\nbasal utterance. World is accounted as something that may enter the field*.\na pipe, phone\u2019s ring, a hat. What was thought of as what made for a\nGreenwald poem turns out to be both more and less than it seemed. Any\nconvivial perhaps casually expansive mode that seemed to be what could be\ncalled the style was, after all, it now appears, only a collection of\ntemporal approximations tailored for what it seems the work, generally,\nthen, had as an aboutness. This was not how he had to write, that was\nwhat he chose. The force of this book\u2019s form, the way it epitomizes,\nlines up, with the pain and loss, anger, reaction, and hope, the terrible\ndissolves that it springs from, that it takes up the colors of, impels\nthe reader to a new assessment. Anyone who can so across the board, after\ntwenty years of writing engineer, or, rather, render, such sweeping changes\nin his writing has to be thought of differently. What we thought of as a\nGreenwald style was all wrong, it was something tailored. What remains,\nwhat resides, a hard edged, tight, unrelenting way of looking that emanates\nfrom this book, and now, in a sense, more clearly, from the older work,\nthat is the uniqueness.\n\n\n\nThere are certain things one isn\u2019t supposed to say. Even the most exhibi-\ntionistic of the late unlamented confessionalists, apart from other more\nformally debilitating adherences, can now be seen, if anyone cares, to\nhave hewn to certain mores of decorum. The most searingly bared revela-\ntions in the first person were still clothed in the inclusiveness of the\nmonolithic lyric Z; by the middle of the century the presentation of liter-\nary self was sufficiently bogged down in a morass of convention that it no\nlonger constituted any great sally to say that this I was capable, or en-\ngaged in, the most terrible affliction or infliction. If it wasn\u2019t com-\npletely worn out as a mode of discourse it was encrusted with as much study\nas any of the older readily compatible fitting prospects on objects (land-\nscapes, etc.).\n\nThe residual tags of disguise, enfeebled necromancy of narration and taste\nin lyric thus constituted, stand out most starkly in the rote fictionaliz-\ning reference this kind of writing called up when the sense of a personal\nplace could no longer be avoided. There were still certain things one did\nnot say. You didn\u2019t name names, at least not the real names. Did Sylvia\never write the word Ted? Even now, in the kind of writing where that sub-\n\n\nject survives, when one half of a couple mentions the other it is in the\ncontext of washing the dishes or babysitting. Some of the constraints on\nthis kind of particularity are self-evident, seeming to have more to do\nwith social binding, decorum in that sense. Similarly, certain accusa-\ntions or lacerations too clearly labelled are out of bounds. Another\nmajor influence in the context is the familiar charying desire to set the\nwriting apart, to push it up to another realm by the deletion of various\nproper nouns and the odd mundane reference.\n\nAt this point in time to make the decision to include these sorts of -\nhyperpersonal reference is to imply a critique and realignment of the\nliterary presentation of the self that injects a healthy note into an\nincreasingly tendentious argument. It is an affirmation that that which\nplaces writing in a place or signature which is some way a beyond has\nlittle to do with discretion or attachable entrances into the basis or\nsource of the work. In twenty years no one will care anyway.\n\nThe formal component of this openness seems rooted in an attitude, a non-\nexclusion taken to its logical conclusion or development, which, as it\nrealizes more and more as pertaining to that which is connected, eviden-\ntiary , important, illuminating, is impelled to present, to include, that\nmuch more.\n\nMICHAEL GOTTLIEB"},{"uid":"MichaelGottlieb_RegardedBecome_1982","author":"Michael Gottlieb","shortTitle":"Regarded, Become","title":"Michael Gottlieb | Regarded, Become | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1982","date":1982,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":4.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEvol4\/pictures\/077.html","text":"\n                Regarded, Become\n\n\n\n\n            Michael Gottlieb\n\n\n\n\nWhy does he let this keep happening to himself? As long as it doesn't matter where one is when one\ncomes home, as long as one can just sit down. I used to like getting into those states, thought it was\nimportant to feel that too. Liking a good depression as much as the next one. A painter made it clear:\nit doesn't matter. It could have been any kind of day. You don't have to forget. There is no such\nthing as a willing subject. Just get home, close the door. They may be dead but still present, lording,\nimpinging, you are still talking to them. Whatever gets carried into the chamber, joins the\nsuspension; there will cloud up a resultant tincture or there won't. It's as if it's not our problem. No\none will or can or have any real opportunity to raise the question. Do you think there is such a thing\nas defense? One was wont to think of the set aside time as the only fully realized, attached, fully\ncharged for this one, for us, for those like us, to be, to get by, only or finally completely separate off;\nrunning on all cylinders, with a hoped for connection, the hope for a date, straightening the seams,\nstudying the mirror, more makeup, a different sweater, bat the eyelashes, another spray, another pat,\nwait for the phone.\n\n                                           \u2022\n\nI always wanted to be a writer. Not to write, just be a writer, like a novelist. And not always, just\nwhen reading started to become a serious alternative to everything else save sleeping, about 10 or 11\nyears old. Not just a writer then, maybe an agent, maybe a racing driver. Reading was, and is, the best\nway of doing nothing. What was there not to understand? One started the same piece over and over\nagain, one called it a story, about eight times from age 12 to 14. Each new beginning came to\napproximately one paragraph. They all, if memory serves, had someone going out of the house early\nin the morning, too early, waiting for the bus to come. At 16, a poetry prize of sorts would be won;\nan anthology with red covers, a poem devolving upon the wonderfully redemptive resiliencies of\nmortality. The family did not like it. In freshman year someone with a name like Wendy would come\nalong; she would break the dam. Then there would be an April or a Shelley.\n\n                                           \u2022\n\nSometimes, the asking. What is the difference? The smartest fellow I ever met, he quit. No one will\ncare. Sometimes it seems to make more sense to make nothing at all. It doesn't do anything, it\ncertainly doesn't add to the capital or help any sort of you. It used to be arrogation, setting down the\n\n\nflung, the extremity of most moment. Then, it started to feel good. This would settle down anyone.\nThe anodyne, now a name for, a full removal, now certain things that one could invest, from their\nlives themselves to something better, making it so, what we carried around became material. It called\nfor a compensatory acknowledgement, grudging with recommendations and qualifying with casting,\nthis is what one gets, with modeling, the systematic application of attribution along ways of\ndisheartening predictable obfuscations of fundamentally grained in and ominously more regulatory\nrepetition. Coming to be regarded with the automatism of the generative fallacies. A decision made\nafter watching something. It would take someone to think of this. Become.\n\n                                          \u2022\n\nExcept for the fact that there are so many things that can go wrong, given a realistic appraisal of\nexceptions, their incidence. It may be that there is a rate, onto which, like an enwrapping wire, the\nvarious turnings come aboard, track themselves in, and are flung off. The inversion in consolation, in\nthe sense of accretion, with some sensible attendant noise. This is the way I would like it, without the\nbit of tinge, a little over there. It was all known, it all became a thing figured out, become general.\nThe continual blunting influences come to be regarded, as if vicissitudes of a sort no longer extant,\nlike an affliction to be read about, like something to befall someone else. Also, partly, the sense of\ndistance was an effect of a still rampant doubt; a query, which in its application here called into\nquestion whether anything, ever, could really happen, to us, could simply crop up in a life, take over\nor utterly penetrate, something convincing whose verification would be no issue. A consistive\nimposition whose stricture would hang on, for varying durations, until, as into every life, that sort of\nevent, undeniable in whatever it was, was finally realized as there.\n\n                                          \u2022\n\nWhat are so often underestimated are all the wrong reasons. Why we want to do, to keep trying, this.\nThere is the argument which posits a withering away of intention, that, that which will last by reason\nthat for all active purposes, their application to what we do, or say everyday is nil, will. The levelizing\nor winnowing influences or tendencies or historical attributes may, for reasons which there is no\nreason why there, themselves, shouldn\u2019t be operating anymore than there should be, all their effect,\npicking and choosing in fact actually operating or manoeuvering behind a veil or wall impenetrable\nto us, and hinge and wheel on the objects in their path. We want to know how to write and how to\nlead our lives. It will offer no pause though. The breakdown, the array of mistalents, self-effacements,\nhopeful postures which constitute the community of what is knowable among us is leavened with\nsomething indeterminate that may not be any more accurate or durable but if at all distinguishable, is\nrecognized by its simple and across the board lack of concern regarding those issues.\n\n\nIf the thing needs no defense, perforce, a necessity of any sort concomitantly diminishes as well. All\nthe different ways we try to clothe our selves. The uneven relation of hunger to appetite. No one\nthought they would have to approach these choices. What gets, or doesn't, done every day is as\naccurate as any other indice. I want not to remember this was going to come up. By dint of\nrepetition, the cumulative effect of always just trying to look in on, keep a distance from, whichever\nlack of ratification. Sometimes I think I am very easily impressed. Everyone wants to put their light\nunder their hat. When you finally get exercised enough, saying something, pretending you are not\nsmart enough for that sort of thing. The things you surround yourself with, that you cannot see, not\ndispersed by the usual agents, the sort by which one, eventually, comes to be recognized. You show\nhim what you feel is proper. The sensibility has any registration solely as the manifestation, trace, of\nchoice, all including alternatives, mundane, what to do at the end of the day. I usually get bored with\nthe same. You write the way you pick out ties. What you get used to saying. Why you keep doing it\nanyway. What you think comes close because of it. The possibility that beckons. You wouldn't want\nit held against you. You are happy when someone hands something to you. It is an attempt to even\nthe score. They take turns. The terms are not readily acceptable. For some reason I seized upon that\nsong to sum up all their activities and labors, through all of that time, it still brings a lump to my\nthroat.\n\n"},{"uid":"MichaelGottlieb_ReviewsandNotes_1980","author":"Michael Gottlieb","shortTitle":"Reviews and Notes","title":"Michael Gottlieb | Reviews and Notes | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/023.html","text":"\nROBERT GRENIER, CAMBRIDGE M\u2019ASS (1979; Tuumba Press, 2639 Russell, Berk-\neley, CA 94705; c. 265 poems; $6)\n\nA large (41\" X 49\") poster, black (variously lengthed\u2014phrase, couplet,\netc.\u2014short lyric\u2014typewriting) on white (individual, \u2019tailored,\u2019 recti-\nlinear \u2019containers\u2019) on black (flat background, field).\n\n\n\nThe language continues his work in delineating the manifestation of the\nheightened, the presence of the superiorly accessing in casual, throw-\naway, or \u2019merely\u2019 quiescent words that flow past us every day, usually\nunheeded.\n\n\nLike his \u2019Cards\u2019 this format seeks, through a positioning of the viewing\npossibilit\u00e9s, to focus special attention on the above property of the\nwriting.

My principal interest is in the semantics of\n  sounds not yet deposited in the sediments of signification. Significa-\n  tion tends to kill that pleasing resonant aureole which words have: it\n  is even possible to arrive in the end where one no longer perceives the\n  sounds of words, but merely follows the line of a performance of tokens.\n  And it is not true that our everyday life must be characterized by such\n  sclerosis. The sound of words can still be a great support to us,\n\n  In finding words we should avail ourselves of all sorts of associative\n  games \u2014 of growth and diminution, of crossings and parallels. The\n  invented word is a good one when its rapport with the other words of its\n  context makes no substitute acceptable.\n\n  When such words are read, they should mean all the things that it seems\n  to the reader that they mean, everything that comes to the mind of the\n  reader (which, in the end, is what happens with any reading).\n\n  These poems are born from the experience of collective readings of\n  poetry before a public (paying or otherwise). On these occasions I have\n  felt the need to allow for redundancy. I have now arrived where I use\n  redundancy as a means, the logical operator which must be mocked,\n  scolded, made ridiculous. The instrument which determines and fixes\n  the space for invention and establishes once and for all that such space\n  exists \u2014 that\u2019s it.\n\n  Poetry is truly successful when it releases a mechanism of contradiction\n  revealed not by the rigor of logic, but by all the rest.\n\n  My poems are iconic. This aspect present in my poems has not been pro-\n  grammed. Rather, it is an aspect which is in some way liberated, or has\n  been liberated. Maybe the liberation of icons was implicit in the pro-\n  gram. The first signification on which the sound of a word fixes itself\n  is an icon.\n\n\nThe content of a poetry is the logic in it and also the worm which kills\npoetry.

Its violations are often painful\nto read: nevertheless, the book is so \u2014 odd\u2014that one is forced into\nrepeated, if perpetually frustrated, investigations. Words signifying\nmany kinds of sexual contact are used on several levels of ambiguity,\noften in metaphysical or philosophical contexts, and frequently to make\nterse, aphoristic statements: \u2019\u2019Sperm obliterates the defeats of lan-\nguage... Lust describes ferment transferred by malformation into a\nfalse essence...\u201d However, many of the red-inked paragraphs are used\nto present, in a fragmented mutilated way, varieties of copulation,\nfellatio, cunnilingus, masturbation and sodomy, apparently performed\nby the narrator\u2014or at least as fantasised by the narrator....\n\nBecause Buck sodomises the whole concept of sequential narrative, there\u2019s\nno one body on which to focus one\u2019s attention, and the effect of the\ngnomic asides forces one to examine one\u2019s own act of focussing attention\non imaginary bodies.... Even if one reads the book as a simple auto-\nbiographical record of Buck\u2019s fantasies\u2014rather as Sartre reads Genet \u2014\n\"an epic of masturbation\"\u2014then one is bewildered by the profusion of\nabstract nouns, the scarcity of concrete detail, and the complete frag-\nmentation of the usual patterns of sexual fantasy, which (normally)\nemploy a structure of tension and relief, of expectation and gratifi-\ncation. Lust uses the language of feeling, but weirdly truncated, de-\nformed, fragmentary. Presumably the text is fuelled by Buck\u2019s own\nlusts \u2014 yet one feels his frustrations are linguistic and literary as\nmuch as sexual.\n\n        PAUL GREEN\n\n"},{"uid":"PaulGreen_PoeticsoftheParanormal_1982","author":"Paul Green","shortTitle":"Poetics of the Paranormal?","title":"Paul Green | Poetics of the Paranormal? | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1982","date":1982,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":4.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEvol4\/pictures\/050.html","text":"\n                Poetics of the Paranormal?\n\n\n\n\n            Paul A. Green\n\n\n\n\nBegin carefully. This complex created by text, anecdote, fragments of imperfect recall, a fuddled\nbeginnings of dialectic, is chaos \u2014 flickering shuffle of pages, tapes hum, as memory's a thickening\nhiss ... It's all so suss, a seductive magnetism from the past, that virtually cryptozoic notion of poet as\nvates\/ oracle\/ shaman, which must be nostalgia, time-sickness. Surely it's an artificially enriched\nnostalgia for the protective encloistering twilight of a Hermetic universe, as evoked in nineteenth-\ncentury Paris by occult revivalist Eliphas Levi, manifested in Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Symbolism, fin-\nde-siecle?\n\n         Yet beyond this nostalgia, \u2014 a homing-pain wrenched out of archeo-psychic void\/primal\nseparation? \u2014 the image of poet-as-magus persists. Aleister Crowley's purloined, eclectic cabbalism\nsurvives (despite the auto-erotic rhetoric of Frater Perdurabo's versifying) to animate, insistently, the\nimagery-clairvoyance, the Vision of his Golden Dawn rival, WB. Yeats. Sustaining the historic\npresent, an 'epidemic of trances' transfixes those Surrealist boulevardiers Desnos, Peter, Crevel, who\nbecome 'modest registering machines' of the automatic message, oracular voices amid the babble of\nthe cafes, while even the diamond-hard atheist Breton writes an Open Letter to Clairvoyants, is\nobsessed with prophecy, precognition, miracles of objective chance, the Marvellous..\n\n         That's enough. Who wants, who needs magi, avatars, voxpop mechanix of the sacred fug,\ncharades of atavistic replay? Mystifications have sanctioned enough private confusion, collective\nmania throughout history \u2014 at best, the 'translucent daydream of poet-as-shaman' (Bill Bennett, in\nLobby II) distracts from our awareness of the need for radical social change. Anyway, in secularized\ncapitalist = communist technocracy, with no context for sharing\/ caring for coherent signification of\nsuper-natural, para-normal, such performance postures falter as neo-primitif chic, frozen-flash of\nmere showmanship (or desperate numbed self-immolation). Even scholarly and more deliberately\nliterary uses of such material become futile, drying up into conceit, a prey to frenzied PMLA\nexplicators. You can't believe it.\n\n         But I still read. The parapsychology of Lethbridge, Koestler, the psycho-biology of Lyall\nWatson, popularizations of the New Physics \u2014 there's a narrowing convergence, over the years. And\nmy writing keeps circling the mystery zones, often tediously, sometimes spiraling in there in flights of\nkamikaze-kitsch bravura, e.g. Ritual of the Stifling Air, for BBC Radio 3,1977, a multi-voice piece\nwhich acts out myths of Neo-Nazi demonology. By the time I've read Iain Sinclair's Lud Heat\n\n  An investigation into writing and parapsychology, with special attention to work by Iain Sinclair.\n\n\npublished 1975, interviewed Sinclair, visited the East London terrain mapped by his book (for BBC\nRadio 3 Processes of Poetry), some working hypotheses have emerged:\n\n        I.         Certain manipulations of language \u2014 utterance, making of signs, text, enactment or\nperformance of texts \u2014 can coincide with, 'cause'\/be caused by' paranormal perceptions and\/or\nalterations of normal space-time coordinates.\n\n        2.         There appear to be a-causal synchronicitous relationships between the flow of events in\nthe writer's life-in-the-world and the shaping of 'pseudo-events' fabulated as linguistic constructs on\nthe page.\n\n        3.         There are complex and paradoxical connections between the 'creative process,' the process\nof verbalization and 'paranormal phenomena' (which is a more inclusive restatement of I).\n\n        4.         There appear to be anomalous relationships between 'consciousness,' as focused by\nreinforced intentionality, and the world,' as scanned\/mapped by languages (which is a more inclusive\nrestatement of 2).\n\n         One would have thought that meaningful social action needed a logos as well as a gnosis of\nsuch phenomena, which apparently rationalized out of existence, reappear irrationally warped, in\nlanguage, action..\n\n         But let's take specifics, as sparked off by Sinclair's Lud Heat, a text of over a hundred pages,\njuxtaposing speculative prose essay, open-form verse journal and detailed documentation of archive\nquotes, historical sources, engravings, photos. The book traces Sinclair's increasingly taut awareness\nof intricate patterns of 'malignity' in East London's twilight zones, Stepney, Hackney, notably\naround the massive neo-pagan churches of the eighteenth-century architect Nicholas Hawksmoor.\n\n         The richness of signification, the meaningful ambiguity, like the manifest content of\ndreaming or the 'primary-process' distortion in telepathy experiments, makes definitive precis\ndifficult. But the process of the writing, working as a gardener in the vicinity of the Hawksmoor\nchurches, subsequently researching the history of the area, forces certain obsessions on Sinclair. 'I\ncan\u2019t get them out of my mind as being part of a death culture .. that gives its focus on a moment of\ndeath .\u2019 (Sinclair, interviewed for Processes of Poetry) \u2018All the Jack the Ripper Murders occurred\naround Christchurch, Spitalfield .\u2019 Jack's autoptic rites are committed in the shade of Hawksmoor's\nheavy Egyptian motifs, which also oversee the ritual disemboweling of the Ratcliffe Highway\nMurderer. The three churches \u2014 Christchurch, St. George, St. Anne's \u2014 are flanked by small\npyramids, stand on pre-Christian sites, are charged with energies and tensions that Sinclair finds\nreflected in Stan Brakhage's autoptic morgue movie The act of seeing with ones own eyes, or the\nenvironmental sculpture of Bryan Catling, himself an intruder in the crypt of St. Anne's. And this\n'paranormal' reading \u2014 of history, of the visual language of church or shrine, is more than paranoia,\nmore than antiquarianism. 'The more I focused on this reading the more I got hit. Diseases and\nstrange seizures of every kind occurred...' \u2014 most bewildering example being the Surgery of the Sun,\n\n\nan inexplicable attack of sunstroke which afflicts Sinclair after a visit to the pyramid in St. Anne's\nchurchyard:\n\nHe thinks of the churches as instruments of surgery, himself as golem, invaded by the planetary beams focused by these\npyramids ... Disease is the means of intergalactic mutation. The germ is Martian. We are invaded by a virus bearing the\nmessage of the stars ... But he has to consider the pyramid as cause. He attributes this church to Selkis, one of the canopic\nguardians, scorpion goddess, identified with the scorching heat of the sun ... And this is illustrated later \u2014 September 4 \u2014\nat Stepney Green School, when old bill Gates, the tea-maker with the ruined feet, came out, for the first time, with the\nschool gang and actually spotted (or caused) a scorpion on the path. We were sitting, dimly, on the grass verge, gazing with\ndead eye at the talismanic arachnid as it crawled towards us.\n\nAbsurd, \u2014 like the 'frustrators' that plagued Yeats and his wife during the dictation of A Vision, or\nthe golden scarab that landed on Jung's windowsill while his patient recounted a scarab dream.\n\n         'We know these things occur. We do not know the rules' (M.R. James). The late T.C.\nLethbridge, recently reassessed in Colin Wilson's Mysteries (1979), suggested that certain places\n'recorded' violent events and continued to replay them, perhaps precipitating reenactment of them.\nWhat Sinclair names as 'time-cone' around the churches becomes a time-clone:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe\n\n                                             speed of the time of the place\n                                             changes. Now I am frighted\n                                             in retrospect by a glimpse\n                                             of the original wood:\n                                             Hawksmoor's staircase\n                                             rising from the recently\n                                             sealed porch. Unvarnished\n                                             grain of parallel universe.\n\nTime-bends \u2014 'actually the painful seizures of breath and gasping because time is enacting too fast\nfor you to handle' \u2014 seem to be part of Sinclair's essentially mediumistic role as a writer, and\npresuppose an abnormal time-consciousness.\n\n         Sinclair's work indeed abounds in anomalies and puzzles of this kind. His subsequent book\nSuicide Bridge links necropolitan London with mythic presences of Southern and Eastern England,\narching across deeper voids of black-hole physics to include a meditation on Howard Hughes\n(riddled with synchronicity) and ending with a macabre monologue from the (severed) head of East\nLondon gangster Slade. And predictably enough, the expensive BBC Nagra recorder malfunctioned\nwhile taping in St. Anne's crypt (just as the studio console kept on freaking out during recording of\nmy Ritual, or so the producer insisted).\n\n\n        If these things occur, if they have rules, pattern, structure, it's more than copy for The\nNational Enquirer, it's a babel of questions:\n\n        Why is so much 'mediumistic writing' so banal, facile, tedious? (Lyall Watson doggedly\nanalysed 5000 samples of 'spirit communication' to arrive at this conclusion.) Does the coexistence of\nsuch texts and 'mediumistic' work which seems to be of 'poetic' value (uses the innate qualities of\nlanguage to intensify affectivity) suggest that alternate realities are structured holistically and\nhierarchically, as in traditional cabbalism, for example? Or \u2014 to fuse speculations of Lyall Watson\nand Colin Wilson \u2014 is there a hierarchy of selves within individuals that at some (unidentified)\npoint, in some (unidentified) way, connects with a biologically based contingent system common to\nall nucleated cells? What \u2014 if anything \u2014 lies beyond the molecular level of protein synthesis in the\nbrain? In what ways do these events interact with patterns of probability-flow in the universe at large?\nIf language \u2014 high-density, information-rich, a semantic gravity-well, language of poetry \u2014 is a\nform of negative entropy, how does it affect the overall energy levels of the cosmos?\n\n        The questions hover like Magritte clouds and 1 can only close by re-phrasing them in\napplication to specific poetics:\n\n        Given that sound poetry has always been aware of its shamanistic roots (cf. Hugo Ball on his\nrecitals at Cabaret Voltaire) and that its practitioners have often such basic hypnotic devices as the\nrepetitions of mantra (e.g. Bill Bissett\u2019s inthemystery) is there any value in comparing such work with\nglossolalia, in tongues (which, according to psychologists, won't decode) or with specialized magical\nlanguages, like Sir John Dee's Enochian (which, according to Crowley, does)? Similarly, can one\ncompare some visual concretism with the magical practice of making and charging sigils, as\nperformed by the painter Austin Spare, and outlined in Skinner and Drury\u2019s Search for Abraxas\n(1975). Alfred Kallir's work on The Psychogenetics of the Alphabet (1960) might illuminate here,\nalthough I feel that pure sound poetry, lettrism risk short-circuit, possibly activating 'paranormal'\nconditions which can't be controlled, directed, an atavism indeed rather than an evolutionary\nadvance?\n\n        For if one follows George Steiner's extension of the Humbolt-Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and\nsees language, in its very tendency to variety, prolixity, creative fabulation, control and development\nof futurity as the (supra???) human evolutionary tool par excellence, then perhaps McGregor Mathers,\nYeats' magical mentor, was right and, 'when a man imagines he actually creates a form on the astral\nplane.' In which case, the 1980s were invented by the 1910 grey room Doc Burroughs in Naked\nLunch? Whatever happens, it looks as if poetry and science are complementing polarities in a forked-\nlightning dialectic that energizes evolutionary change through the bio-social broth, animal\/ alphabet\nsoup of time..\n\n"},{"uid":"PaulGreen_WilliamPryor_1980","author":"Paul Green","shortTitle":"William Pryor","title":"Paul Green | William Pryor | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn13\/pictures\/013.html","text":"\nWilliam Pryor, Unearth (Galloping Dog Press, 3 Otterburn Terrace,\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne NE2 3AP, England)\n\nThe extension of nature into a written work, especially a poem, or, as we\nhave in Pryor\u2019s book, a group of poems that infiltrate the close proxim-\nity of man with his land, becomes the standard by which we come to under-\nstand an ownership; an ownership of dust, of position, of sky, cloud,\nseed, of the buried palace of the mole.\n\nPryor\u2019s ownership of natural elements is almost rapturously clinical.\nHis poems are written as centres on which the entire descriptive weight\nhas to be slight enough to maintain natural balance.

I choose to have as my limitation spoken\nspeech, as you and I are sitting here talking. That\u2019s what I test the\npoem\u2019s shape against.\n\nOccasionally, I like to do other things, when I hear a completely pecu-\nliar sound or something, see if it works, give it a test run. Eventually,\nI prefer dealing with items that are still charged with meaning and in\nfact are open to the change that happens over time in meanings. In other\nwords, if I don\u2019t know exactly what a poem means when I write it I\u2019m\nsomehow writing a certain kind of science fiction, because the poem (if\nI\u2019m right about the direction the language will change in) will eventually\nmake sense on a more than just, say, shape level or form level as time\ngoes by and I\u2019ll start to understand it more.\n\nI\u2019m an opportunist: I\u2019ll take what I can get. If it works and if it\u2019s\nworking when I\u2019m working on it, then I\u2019ll use it. I don\u2019t care what\nthe source of it is. But I\u2019m saying that the basic motor on my car is\nspoken (for): What it sounds like in my mind when I read it to myself.\n\nWhat works has to be grounded in the language, which is the locality of\nwords. Words change in spoken language. \"the\/form\/of\/the\/words\/pump\/\nblood\/in\/the\/form\/of\/the\/heart\" That pretty much sums it up.\n\nWhat I\u2019m interested in and always have been is not what ideas people\nhave in their heads, but what\u2019s in the air. The most invisible part of\n\u2019\u2019trends\u201d. What is it that two people in the whole world or maybe twenty\nall of a sudden out of the middle of nowhere start to think about.\nWhat\u2019s in the air is the shape of things to come \u2014 it\u2019s palpable \u2014\nright under your very nose. I hear what\u2019s in the air, that\u2019s my way of\nthinking with my ear. You\u2019re not working with the idea of something,\nyou\u2019re projecting the idea of something. You\u2019re not working from models,\nyou\u2019re creating models.\n\nIt\u2019s a romantic notion (where classical means coming from someplace),\ngoing someplace, sort of operating more out of imagination and less from\nreceived forms. In a specific sense, what it is the interior mind pro-\njecting itself into the phenomenQlogical world, telling you where it\u2019s\ngoing. The time we live in is interesting, since there\u2019s a tremendous\namount of good poetry that\u2019s \u2019\u2019about\u201d comings and going, this\u2019s and that\u2019s,\nhere and there, not sillyass schools of one thing or another (\u201din\u201d and\n\u2019\u2019out\u201d I lew to the hosts and hostesses of the world) .\n\n\nPoetry is about a time that hasn\u2019t occurred yet, and if it\u2019s very good\nit\u2019s about a time you\u2019ll never know about. Poems are my pencil and pad\nfor jotting down shapes or ways of embodying imaginary shapes or things\nthat don\u2019t exist. But some time will exist on a wider scale. This is\neven conceptual: They are almost like plans for the future.\n\nI think that the notion that sort of got started with Pound and other\nmodernist artists is that if you were dealing with something you were\ngoing to take notes and the notes will usually be in fractional form.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with writing poetry that uses fragments (or notes) is that\nthere is no everyday language that can be used to test goodness of fit.\nAll there is is some poetic diction or poetic language to go back to\nthat says \u2019\u2019This is correct!,\u201d but no language in everyday use by people\nspeaking, which changes over time, however imperceptibly.\n\nI personally don\u2019t believe in using some form of a poem as a container\nfor a bunch of things (\u2019\u2019good lines\u201d for instance). Each poem\u2019s form dis-\ncovers itself as I write the poem. Two poems may not be perceptibly\ndifferent looking, but there are differences. And, since I write on a\nday-to-day basis, and try to pay as close attention as possible, by\npaying close attention can see those differences. And watch the form\nof the poem, and the meaning and sense of sounds and words, change.\nAnd satisfy myself as a good reader with a good read.\n\n        TED GREENWALD\n\n\n\n\n\nGREENWALD BIBLIOGRAPHY: Lapstrake (1965, Lines Books, NY).

Not parallel,\nnot opposed: their borders actually are porous and frequently crossed, their trajectories are often\nsuperimposed, overlapping like tiles at times, or stepped like masonry. Subtle or obvious, their\nreciprocal borrowings and do-si-doing are frequently perceptible, as much so at the level of materials\nand structures as at that of objectives.\n\nI.\n\nThe first of these four currents is defined by the essentially phonetic or post-phonetic materials that it\nuses. If we want to trace out a historical lineage for it, we must look, starting from the turn of the\ncentury, to Morgenstern and his 'Grosse Lalula', and after that to the Dadaists, Hugo Ball, Tzara,\nRaoul Hausmann, Schwitters among others, (and to Iliazd and Klebnikov before them), to the Italian\nFuturists, and P.A. Birot, and then later, 'among others', to Seuphor, P\u00e9tronio, Antonin Artaud and\nfinally in 1947 to the Lettristes (I. Isou, who published his Introduction \u00e0 une nouvelle po\u00e9sie et \u00e0 une\nnouvelle musique (Gallimard) in that year, Lemaitre, Spacagna ..). This rapid survey brings us up to\nthe appearance of the tape recorder, which begins in the period 19S3-60 to play the foundational,\nrevolutionary role of a new medium.\n\n         Taking the tape recorder as limit-axis, there are some who lie on the far side, having little or\nonly incidental recourse to it. Among these are Mimmo Rotella, Peter Greenham, Ernst jandl, Lora-\nTotino, Bliem Kern, Bill Bissett, Maurizio Nannucci, and some of the 'concrete' poets, whose\nfundamentally \u2018visual\u2019 texts can tilt into a 'sound-perspective' when they are 'said' (and Lily\nGreenham is their outstanding interpreter).\n\n         Others, located beyond strict phoneticism (but on this side of any semantic) join the tape\nrecorder to the cry, to respiration and the rush of breath \u2014 F. Dufr\u00e8ne in his \u2018Crirhythmes\u2019, Da\nSilva, Gills, and even Yoko Ono (let's not forget her participation in Fluxus) \u2014 to the entire body\nand to the body's heart (H. Chopin in his audiopoems).\n\n         Others, again, at the frontier of the second current (that joining the tape recorder with\nsemantics) combine phoneticism, semantics and electroacoustical media in one way or another.\nThese are (a thousand pardons for the hasty schematisations) Franz Mon, R\u00fchm, Bob Cobbing,\nPaula Claire, I. Laaban, Damen....\n\n  Translated by Tom LaFarge\n\n\nII.\n\nThe second current exploits the whole range of possibilities offered by the tape recorder\u00b9 (the\nmagnetic tape standing in for the page as spring-board and locus of creation) to situate (and\ntransform) a certain number of the semantic elements that chance chooses, retains, selects, improvises\nor providentially (!) furnishes. The field of this current \u2014 open not closed \u2014 stretches from the\nextreme limits of the first to those of the next which is (this time unequivocally) located at the pivot-\npoint of music. It is the use of the word and of words that welds together the various elements of this\nsecond sorting-board (spoken words still, not sung, or very seldom), it is a will to signify through\naimed 'compositions' and directed texts the will of a language called upon to develop, unfold itself,\ncarve itself out within a precise measure of time and a constructed space (the text, while still a sound-\ntext, having been conceived with the fundamental aim of projection to the limit in space). All this it\nattempts by a (parsimonious) use of electroacoustical means, to be sure, but also and mainly by facing\nup to the exigencies of 'duration' ' of density and of the time element, within all of which the text is\ncalled upon to unfold and develop itself.\n\n         In this perspective, the recorded text, though still based upon words, may be (or nearly be)\nabstracted (Neil Mills, Charles Verey, Clarck), words and rhythms taking on then a specific density\nwhich is that of their sonority, frequency, coloration, intensity, relative location, succession,\nconnotation, reference.\n\n         Still in this second trajectory, we glide progressively from these semantico-abstract works and\nexperiments towards work of increasing signification (in spite of or because of the tape recorder,\nwhich allows to some in due course the inclusion in the text of natural noises, sound effects, the\nrumor of crowds, and even, at the far limit, of music \u2014 following a style that is sometimes abusively\ncharged with radiophonics). These works may come under the heading of folklore (Rothenberg, af\nKlintberg); they may be narrative, exemplary or didactic (A. Hodell, Helms, Anderson, Mac Low);\nthey may be based on witty semantic games and quibbles (Brion Gysin's 'permutations', Gherasim\nLuca); or upon reports, truncated slices of reconstituted life, analyses, soundings, dreams and violent\nurges (Paul de Vree, L. Novak, Michael Chant, O\u2019Gallagher, John Giorno, and my own \u2018Biopsies\u2019\nand \u2018Passe-Partout\u2019); or, finally, they may recline upon the practice of obsessive repetition, as a take-\noff strip or a pickaxe (C. Amirkhanian, Gnazzo, Saroyan) ..\n\n         Before coming to the third current of \u2018poetry-music-poetry\u2019, I should mention here, under\nthe heading of remarkable pivot-points, the infra-folksong, both the \u2018white\u2019 kind \u2014 spoken,\nincantatory \u2014 of Peter and Patricia Harleman, and the \u2018black\u2019 version of The Last Poets \u2014 infa-jazz\n\u2018uttered\u2019 \u2014 or the \u2018talking pop\u2019 of Shiva.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThe third current has bowed the knee before the machine \u2014 or desired to exorcise it! And why not?\nWhence follows its resorting to each and every possibility in electronics. Whence the\nreduction\/sublimation of language to a simple though selected base-material of sound, which the\nMachine has no hesitation in pulverizing, dissolving, and blowing I apart. The spoken word, the\nphrase, the text are gobbled up and devoured by Her, and all their original semantic anchorages are\nsprung! Nothing left but a grain of sound, turned on its head but still oh! specific, being of vocal\norigin.\n\n         In this neomusical or hyperpoetic, neopoetic or hypermusical (who is going to settle this? ...\nwho? and let each dog ... when all is said and done! ... ) current: C. Clozier, P. Rochefort (subjectivity\nand tenderness, objectivity and fact, humour and lyricism), Ashley, Steve Reich, A. Lucier (repetition\n... repetition ... repetition ., drug upon drug upon drug: bewitchment), and finally the Swedish\nschool: Sten Hanson (more and more), Bengt Emil Johnson, Svante Bodin, Lars Gunar Bodin,\nMellnas, all musicians of formation (the machine's crumbling, devouring, crushing of the text, words,\nphonemes, letters).\n\n         Let each of these who come up against this simplified enumeration and demonstration, while\nengaged in his or her own particular universe or pipeline with its special nuances and subtleties \u2014 let\nthem forgive me!..\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe fourth current, finally, having no recourse to the tape recorder, aims to topple a written text\n(banal when you come down to it), to project, catapult, string it out across a space of sound and a\nduration in order to transform its kind and its impact. Here the weight of duration \u2014 whether lists,\nenumerations, repetitions \u2014 plays a decisive part. And these (even Rabelais, maybe!) veer about\namong genres and perspectives, sensibilities and dimensions, and by this skewing come to reconnect\nwith our subject. P.A. Gette has gotten us used to his readings of scientific lists, in Latin, of plants or\ncoleoptera. Michele Metail never ceases to add to the complements of the noun still further\ncomplements of nouns. And these readings aloud appear to us as rediscovered keys to oral\ncommunication.....The voice, then, as the bottom line, once more.\n\n         The voice is at the center (as motor, vehicle, material and formal cause, it hardly needs to be\nsaid) of the whole phenomenon of Sound Poetry. This does not aim to set forth a 'new' movement in\npoetry, but very simply to show that poetry is trying to rediscover, has at last rediscovered, her\nnatural and perennial vehicle, the voice. And not just the voice but action as well.\n\n         Setting Gutenberg respectfully to one side, it is \u2014 through this decisive take-off from the\npage \u2014 truly the voice that all the practitioners of this 'other' poetry, Sound Poetry, and all the\n\n\nmusicians of this New Music, are auscultating: the voice natural or filtered through the machine \u2014\nthe voice with its potential, with everything that it can charge itself with, with all that can be revealed\nthrough it \u2014 the voice both as raw material and as means of revelation. Poets and musicians\ncertainly, but now a good number and ever increasing of writers as well, who not yet come to the\npractice of it still lean and gaze that way.\u00b2 There are critiques that go so far as to make of the voice a\nbasis for analysis that reascends to the work so rendered.\u00b3 And twenty years is no time at all! 'Vocal\nwriting ... let's speak as though it existed...' (Barthes).\n\n         Very well then! may these ten days\u2074 devoted to it show that it does indeed exist, that in\ntwenty years it has moved, changed, evolved, displayed its trajectories, its range and the distance it\nhas crossed, the developments that have opened up within it, its lines of force, and also, of course, the\nrisks and dangers that lie in wait for it; and that it is, beyond all literary intention, in its very\nstammerings that it seeks to join to itself the life it physically yearns after, that it tries to decipher in\nthe \u2018action\u2019\u2075 of a moment, that it wants to project, in mingled text-action, far beyond the traditional\nor contemporary props of paper and magnetic tape.\n\n\nNOTES\n\n1. That is, variation of speed, echo, 'depths, simultaneous overlays, stereophonic effects,\n    superimpositions, dialogues, audioassemblages, intensities, truncations, etc ... etc...\n\n2. I hardly need to say that I am not thinking here of what is called 'tape recorder literature', that of\n    Paul Bowles or Ahmed, whose immense interest is not in question here, but where the voice only\n    appears through the re-transcription of direct spontaneous recordings onto the page. I am more\n    concerned with those passages of increasing prominence and frequency that refer to the voice and\n    to the potential of the tape recorder \u2014 passages which have in common the 'subtle' charm of\n    seeming to ignore the method of their own contexts, of staying under cover, well insulated by the\n    book, and of imagining such an opening-up only to avoid the risks involved. There is an urgent\n    need that we realize that above and beyond all pious wishes, there is an adventure to be lived in\n    the \u2018practice\u2019 of orality, past and still continuing, as well as a logic of the unknown to be taken\n    upon oneself. This take-off has been a leap in the dark for everyone, compared to the comforts of\n    the page, and still is. Thus, among the many declarations of intention that up to now have never\n    effectively been followed up, I will restrict myself to the mention, by way of example, of Michel\n    Butor: 'The mobility of reading being far larger than that of any listening, one can dream, book\n    in hand, of every kind of overhearing.' (6.810.000 litres d'eau par seconde, Gallimard.) But why\n    not follow these paradoxical 'stereophonic studies' \u2014 since they bear this title \u2014 right through\n    to the limit of their conceit, and mingle text and voice? In the same way, Roland Barthes writes\n    from another perspective: 'If it were possible to imagine an esthetic of textual pleasure, we ought\n    to include in it 'writing aloud'. We do not practice this vocal writing (not at all the same thing as\n    speech) but it is doubtless what artaud recommends and Sollers demands. Let's speak as though\n    it existed.' (Le plaisir du texte, Editions du Seuil [1973] Collection Tel Quel). Finally it was\n    indeed Sollers who disclosed that: 'My dream would be to come to create a sort of opera of the\n    tongue...\u2019, and followed up on the tape recorder's uses that were destined to create the effects of\n    sound of a text intended for the page (Interview in Le Monde for November 29th, 1975). May\n    this dream be realized.\n\n3. Philippe Mikriamos (author of the first study of William Burroughs [S\u00e9ghers]), on the occasion of\n    the first 'Tangier Colloquium' held at Geneva from September 24th to 28th, 1974, focused his\n    critical 'intervention' into the work of Burroughs and Brion Gysin upon an analysis of the\n    former's works and books that took off from his voice and manner of speech, with the help of\n    recordings, and from the recorded voices of other poets and writers by way of comparison.\n    Wasn't this the first such critical approach?\n\n4. This account is excerpted from Heidsieck's catalogue, Po\u00e9sie action, po\u00e9sie sonore 1955-1975,\n    written by way of introduction to the 'Panorama de la po\u00e9sie sonore internationale' that was\n    presented by Heidsieck from January 2oth to 31st, 1976, in conjunction with the cycle of 'voice'\n    demonstrations organized by Annick Le Maine at 21 Avenue du Maine, in Paris, from January\n    12th to February 6th, 1976 (Translator's note).\n\n5. For many years I have been using the term 'action poetry' on the occasion of public\n    demonstrations, So has Robert Filliou, with negligible differences.

I\nam thinking here now more of taking lines in, or \u2019\u2019taking it all in,\u201d\nthan of any putting out. It seems that what presses as a question upon\nwriting now (when it comes to talk of structures, for example, or\nsystems) is how to arrange words (or word groups) rather than how to\nchoose them. How to lay them there, or, rather, string them \u2014 the only\nsimultaneity available now being a kind of potent neutrality \u2014 suscep-\ntibility, or piling up bn words (as opposed to the Elizabethan cumula-\ntive techniques, which amount to a (lovely, to me) piling on <9\/words).\nFeelings embrace fields, but ideas, which are points, point. (Memory\ndoes field understanding, but only retrospectively.)\n\nPutting things together in such a way as to enable them to coincide, to\nmake that kind of motion, is, like the \u2019\u2019collage\u201d and the \u2019\u2019cluster,\u201d an\nattempt (by analogy with music\u2019s chord) at suggesting (since that is\nall one can do) simultaneity, hoping for inherence, haphazard, happy\nchance. As a writer, but especially as a poet, one looks there to\ndiscover the natural order in language, in words as they represent but\nparticularly as they don\u2019t-only, in words together, lively \u2014 at play\nin the fields (finally) where \u201do there now their tone\u201d make a way of\nseeing connections see writing. Like the natural order elsewhere,\nthings can\u2019t be seen in ones alone, make twos. Twos and more, too.\nI am interested in that.\n\n\nAnother way of phrasing the question might be to inquire into the rela-\ntionship between relativity and dialectics, the relativity being that\n\n\none with that one and the dialectics as the two then made: \"The distance\nthat every great writer maintains between himself and his object.\"\n(Walter Benjamin)\n\nA real object. So it\u2019s true. What do I believe in? nothing.\n\n\"I keep an eye on things, like what wars do to little shops.\"\n\nDialectics, as I understand the term, is a style of inquiry; it requires\nthat thought move. And since all movement is interstitial, occurring\nby points between points, such movement in thought is a process of\nconnection; in dialectics it is concerned with what emerges when some\nthings, under force (even \"the force of circumstance\") are, or proceed\ntoward, other things. Words, for example, simply can\u2019t help but give\nonto ideas. It is for this reason that they form language \u2014 language\nin this case being an operation of connection. I want to take a\nmeasure of the elements and to measure the space between them.\n\nThat tree down\nwould be news up\nthere\n\nWho\u2019s to say along what binding forces we bound,\n\n                                                       LYN HEJINIAN\n"},{"uid":"LynHejinian_IfWritingIsWriting_1978","author":"Lyn Hejinian","shortTitle":"If Writing Is Writing","title":"Lyn Hejinian | If Writing Is Writing | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn3\/pictures\/010.html","text":"\n\n        IF WRITTEN IS WRITING\n\n\nI think of you, in English, so frequent, and deserved, and thereby\ndesired, their common practice and continually think of it, who, since\nthe Elizabethans, save Sterne and Joyce, have so trothed language to the\nimagination, and Melville, of whose Mardi the critics wrote, in 1849, \u201da\ntedious, floundering work of uncertain meaning or no meaning at all. A\nhodgepodge.... A story without movement, or proportions, or end ... or\npoint! An undigested mass of rambling metaphysics.\"\n\nNo-one is less negligent than you, to render the difficulties less\nwhether well-protected, in grammar, in which it has been customary to\ndistinguish syntax from accidence, the latter tending to the inflections\nof words \u2014 inflections, or towards itself, a bending in. The choices\nhave always been fashioned and executed from within. Knowing is right\nand knowing is wrong. Nodding is, or could be, to you.\n\nIn such are we obsessed with our own lives, which lives being now language,\nthe emphasis has moved. The emphasis is persistently centric, so that\nwhere once one sought a vocabulary for ideas, now one seeks ideas for\nvocabularies. Many are extant. Composition is by. The technique is\nvery cut and the form is very close. Such is surprising even now, if\noverdue. Now so many years ago Donne wrote, Some that have deeper digg\u2019d\nLoves Mine than I, Say, where his centrique happinesse doth lie.\n\nThe text is anterior to the composition, though the composition be\ninterior to the text. Such candor is occasionally flirtatious, as candor\nnearly always so. When it is trustworthy, love accompanies the lover,\nand the centric writers reveal their loyalty, a bodily loyalty. Quite\npartial is necessity, of any text. Marvelous are the dimensions and\ntherefore marvelling is understandable \u2014 and often understanding. Much\nelse isn\u2019t, but when, that comes, from the definite to an indefinite,\nhaving devised excuses for meeting, though we have not yet recognized, a\nselection, or choice, of what is combed out. The original scale deter-\nmines the scope, the mood, the feel, the tone, the margin, the degree,\nthe mathematics, the size, the sign, the system, the pursuit, the\nposition, the mark.\n\nOf centricities, an interior view, there are two sources, perhaps three.\nOne locates in the interior texture of such language as is of the person\ncomposing from it, personal and inclusive but not necessarily self-\nrevelatory \u2014 in fact, now, seldom so; through improvisatory techniques\nbuilding on the suggestions madb by language itself \u2014 on patterns of\nlanguage which are ideas and corresponding behavior or relevant quirks;\nthis becomes an addictive motion \u2014 but not incorrect, despite such\n\n\ndistortion, concentration, condensation, deconstruction and such as asso-\nciation by, for example, pun and etymology provide; an allusive psycho-\nlinguism. In the second it is the bibliography that is the text. The\nwriting emerges from within a pre-existent text of one\u2019s own devising or\nanother\u2019s. The process is composition rather than writing.\n\nThere are characteristic, contracting rhythms. The long line, with\nramifying clauses, an introductory condition, and other cumulative devices\nhave been fragmented, the rhythm accentuated. You can read. You can\nwrite. An unstable condition is given pause. The Elizabethans were\ngiven to a long system and we to purchase for pause, though not stop.\n\nA possible third centricity, the perhaps, emerges from the imperatives\nand prerogatives of grammar. Such might be a work of, say, conjunctions,\nin which, for example, John Lloyd Stephens writes, \u2019\u2019There is no immediate\nconnection between taking Daguerreotype portraits and the practice of\nsurgery, but circumstances bring close together things entirely dissimilar\nin themselves, and we went from one to the other.\u201d Such is a definition\nof the Elizabethan conceit. And in a blue book of French grammar one\nreads, \u2019\u2019Linking is rare between a plural noun and a verb or between a\nplural adjective and a verb except in poetry.\u201d\n\nAll theory is safest ascribed in retrospect. On the line is an occasion\nto step off the line. The critic is a performer, good or bad. Facility\nis splendid, however \u2014 think of such heroic figures as Dr. Johnson, John\nDonne. Love was not easy. The cat gets the chair and you get the edge.\n\nConclusion:\n\nby usual standing under half\n\n\nLYN HEJINIAN\n\n"},{"uid":"LynHejinian_NonPoetry_1979","author":"Lyn Hejinian","shortTitle":"Non-Poetry","title":"Lyn Hejinian | Non-Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/020.html","text":"\n    LYN HEJINIAN :\n\n  1.

He ties\nthis last concept with being \u2019\u2019particulate\u201d or contextualized as \u2019\u2019one basis,\nsame thing.\u201d His text comes, apparently, from a longer work entitled\n\u2019\u2019Heroes, How They File Past,\u201d so perhaps some of the brevity of the\ndiscussion explains its quality of raising questions that might well be\nanswered elsewhere in his text. But my own questions that are provoked\nby Sondheim\u2019s text are not so much in defense of Cage or Duchamp, both of\nwhom I happen to admire, but are concerned with what seem to be the assump-\ntions of Sondheim\u2019s text:\n\n\n      1) I am bothered by its quality of automatism, of reflex action. He\n\n\nseems to be arguing from the point of view of the people without asking\nhimself who the people are. If he wants to claim them as the statistical\nmajority, then either he must show that Cage and Duchamp do, in fact,\nassume privilege and that this is not in the people\u2019s best interests, or\nhe must propose a positive model of popular art (Khachiturian? the faceless\ncollective piano concerti from the People\u2019s Republic of China?) which is\nmore in the people\u2019s best interests, and which creates a popular context...\n\n      2)        The very essense of his attack on privilege is the assumption\nthat privilege is inherently unfair. But is it? I was privileged to be\ntaught German at an early age, and it is my pleasure and my privilege to\nread in that language. Am I a snob because I sometimes speak in that\nlanguage or read in it, when not everybody else has had the privilege of\nlearning it? Avant-garde art\u2014and through the years Cage and Duchamp have\nboth remained or at least had implications for the avant-garde\u2014is a\nlanguage, native to some and taught to others; the benefits of having\nworked in that language can be made available to all, over a period of\ntime. But to attack the privilege of working in that language seems to be\nto propose its eradication\u2014or at least its watering down into a sort of\nbastardization.... It is indeed a privilege, if one be an artist, to be\nthat first person, and it is only when there is unequal access to cultural\nprivilege that the situation becomes unwholesome. When an elite restricts\naccess to cultural privileges to itself\u2014as in 18th Century France or early\n20th Century Europe\u2014then the situation should be changed. But to attack\nprivilege as such... is to guarantee mediocrity, and in the long run\npeople\u2019s hunger simply cannot be satisfied by mediocre art. Thus, if\nSondheim wanted to guarantee a popular context for art, he should not be\nautomatically attacking privilege but should be working on the problem\nof access....\n\n      3)        Finally, Sondheim seems to advocate a process of reading \"through\nthe text, consider\u00a1_ingj possibilities of theory.\u201d That is, of course, its\nown hermeneutic\u2014an advocated method of reading, of interpretation. I\u2019m\nall for it. But why not, instead of attacking Cage and Duchamp whose\n\u2019\u2019privilege\u201d is only their response ^o the real needs of their moments, as\nthey saw them\u2014Sondheim uses the metaphor of Solzhenitsyn\u2019s Gulag, \u2019\u2019random\nterror leading to the Gulag\u201d as giving the logic to his dissatisfaction\nwith using aleotoric methods in art\u2014why not instead explore the nature of\nnot just a personal, individual hermeneutic of experiencing art but a\nplural, social one? Why not explore the question not just of What am I\nexperiencing when I read\/hear\/see this work? but of What are we experien-\ncing when WE read\/hear\/see it? Or even when we perform it? That would\nseem to be a more profitable area to explore than this automatic attack\non privilege, for it would raise the real social contextualization of a\nwork, the problem of access to it.\n\n\n                                                       DICK HIGGINS\n"},{"uid":"DickHiggins_PatternPoems_1978","author":"Dick Higgins","shortTitle":"Pattern Poems","title":"Dick Higgins | Pattern Poems | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn1\/pictures\/016.html","text":"PATTERN POEMS\n\n\n    (Dick Higgins' new book, George Herbert\u00b9s Pattern Poems: In Their Tradition,\n    Unpublished Editions; $5.95, c\/o Serendipity, 1790 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley,\n    CA 94709, is composed of 28 beautifully printed pattern poems by primarily\n    Greek, Latin, Medieval and Renaissance poets.

The essential\n    difference between a \"charm\" and a \"poem\" is, of course, that the former\n    aims toward magical efficacy while the latter attempts an aesthetic\n    impact. But even here there is a convergence, since the aesthetic impact\n    of the charm could well be a part of its magical power. Thus the\n    linguistics involved in a charm and a poem could be very similar.\n\n\n         The theoretical underpinnings of such aesthetics lie in the cosmology\n   which the Middle Ages attributed to Pythagoras, who was regarded as the\n   greatest philosopher of antiquity, greater even than Plato and Aristotle\n   though, as a pagan, somewhat suspect. The Pythagorean system, as developed\n   i:i the Hermetic tradition and elsewhere as well as from Plato\u2019s Timaeus\n   (which was one of the only Platonic dialogues available to the Middle Ages),\n   was based on a hierarchy of \"things\u2019 at the bottom, the perceptions,\n   feelings, and qualities associated with them next, followed by the word\n   or logos, next the idea or form, penultimately the numbers or ratios, and\n   finally the divine principle itself, conceivable only metaphorically in\n   the Music of the Spheres. Within such a system, a word stood not for the\n   thing it denoted but for the idea underlying it, and was thus a symbol of\n\n* pure form. As such it was closer to the essence of numbers and ratios in\n   the hierarchy than anything it might describe, and was therefore invested\n   with a power which we sometimes find difficult to understand.... A similar\n   sacred power was attributed to letters, which were not seen as mechanical\n   components of the written word, but as essential and autonomous\n   instruments expressing the process underlying them, analogous therefore\n   to numbers and proportions. The process of forming words became, then, a\n   very sacred one indeed, part of the divine game of realizing things out of\n   their underlying numbers or letters....\n\n         Inherent in the concept of a pattern poem is its unsuitability for\nany sustained argument of emotional persuasion. Its appeal is immediate\nand involves the recognition of the image. Thus the Aristotelian\nrhetorical goal of persuading and convincing a reader is unlikely to be\nachieved within a pattern poem. And an Aristotelian age\u2014such as followed\nthe baroque\u2014would, and did, find the pattern poem essentially trivial and\neccentric. The age that followed the baroque was characterized by a\ntremendous emphasis upon power and force.... It is doubtful that the\npattern-poem format could achieve the \"suspension of disbelief\" so sought\nafter by fiction-oriented centuries. But today, with power far less to\nthe point\u2014with less insistence upon a poem that it \"move\" the reader\u2014\n> the pattern poem has again emerged, in its new guise as the concrete\npoetry genre."},{"uid":"HenryHills_ReviewsandNotes_1980","author":"Henry Hills","shortTitle":"Reviews and Notes","title":"Henry Hills | Reviews and Notes | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/034.html","text":"\nRON SILLIMAN, SITTING UP, STANDING, TAKING STEPS (1978; Tuumba Press,\n2639 Russell Street, Berkeley, CA 94705; $2)\n\n     nominative phrases (\u2019\u2019Not nouns.\u201d) (sister to questions of \u2019\u2019Sunset\nDebris\u201d, a nominative phrase)...When you accept the limits (boundaries)\nof a SYSTEM, Ron sd. something like, you find you have as much (more)\nfreedom as\/than acting (writing) w\/o restriction,,,tho (Ambivalence, an\nautobiography) here: \u201dA system, an argot\u201d (i.e., more or less secret\nvocabulary & idiom peculiar to a particular group)...

As a general rule of thumb, most modern lyric\n   poets have been effete. The sensitivity required for producing lyric\n   verse is most often found in social and physical misfits, in the\n   physically weak, the mentally unbalanced, the emotionally disturbed,\n   and the sexually uncertain \u2014 in troubled souls whose poems serve\n   as an escape from a world with which they cannot cope. Of course,\n   there are enough wholesome exceptions to prove the rule, but they\n   are greatly outnumbered by less virile natures.\"\n\n      \"Und so was lebt?\", as German-speakers say : \"And that's alive\n(now)?\" The quote is from p. 142 of the \"Twayne World Authors Series\"\nvolume on Oswald von Wolkenstein, published in 1973.\n\nkkkk\n\n      In his essay collection The Jewel-Hinged Jaw (Berkley Windhover,\n1978), Samuel R. Delany, author of the monumental and monumentally ne-\nglected macro-fiction Dhalgren (1975) , states that\n\n   \"...it is not unreasonable to suppose that where there were six major\n   and fourteen minor poets in England in 1818, today, there are fifty\n   times six major poets (about three hundred) and fifty times fourteen\n   (about seven hundred) of merit and interest in America.... Now the\n   academic establishment, for years, has invested amazing energy, time,\n\n\n   money, and (above all) mystification in perpetuating the view that,\n   somehow, Eliot, Auden, and Pound form some mysterious qualitative\n   analog with Byron, Keats, Shelley, while (and I quote the list from\n   the opening pages of Howard\u2019s Alone with America : ) \u2019Berryman,\n   Bishop, Jarrell, Lowell, Roethke, and Wilbur\u2019 start to fill along\n   with Frost, Stevens, and Hart Crane, the places left vacant by the\n   minor romantics of 1818...\"\n\n      Delany goes on to observe that \"most people would rather not\nrespond to a poem at all without the reassurance of critical approbation\/\nmystification\" and points out that in the realm of published poetry\nthere isn\u2019t, at present, enough such \"fame\" to go around :\n\n   \"1 think people have known this in a vaguely inarticulate way for\n   years : it has resulted in an immense effort to propagate the lie\n   that while the population rises geometrically, the amount of poetic\n   excellence remains an arithmetic constant.\"\n\n      Lucidly on target, Delany arrives at the conclusion that the days\nwhen the poetry critic\u2019s job was to establish the definitive \"canon of\nexcellence\" are over and won\u2019t return, since \"There are hundreds on\nhundreds on hundreds of American poets.

For one thing, from a Marxist\nviewpoint, the truth about social relations and about the place of\nculture in them does not lie on the surface of everyday life; it is\nstructurally concealed by that phenomenon called reification, a phenome-\nnon generated by the presence of commodities all around us. (See Lukdcs\u00b9\n\n\ndifficult but important study of this process in History and Ctass\nConsciousness.) And, clearly enough, if commodities are the source of\nthis opacity or obfuscation of daily life, it will get worse rather than\nbetter as consumer society develops and becomes world-wide. Indeed, it\nis a kind of axiom of Marxism that Marx\u2019s own discovery of the fundamental\nlaws of social life under capitalism (the labor theory of value) was a\nunique historical possibility, available only after the dissolution of\nfeudal society and the emergence of industrial capitalism, but then in\nthe late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries increasingly covered over\nagain by reification. This means not only that any true account of the\nmechanisms at work behind daily life and lived experience is going to\nlook \"unnatural\u201d and untrue to \"common sense\" (how can we analyze reifi-\ncation without inventing an ugly word for it?); but also that one of the\nfeatures of such an account will have to be the destruction of our own\nhabits of reified perception, and the explanation of why we cannot\ndirectly or immediately perceive the truth in the first place. A Marxian\ndescription of social and cultural life is therefore going to have to be\nreflexive and self-conscious, as well as hermeneutic, because part of the\npoint to be made by such writing is precisely our own conscious or uncon-\nscious resistance to it. Here it should be added that the call for a\n\"plain style,\" for clarity and simplicity in writing, is an ideology in\nits own right, and one which has its own history in the Anglo-American\ntradition. One of its basic functions is precisely to discredit dialec-\ntical writing and to secure the ground for one or the other versions of\nBritish empiricism or common-sense philosophy.\n\n     Now when you block out the situation of dialectical writing in this\nway, some interesting parallels come to mind.... The parallel which\ninterests me ... in the present context is that with poetry itself.\nSurely one of the unique features of the situation of poetry today\u2014what\nwe call modernist and Romantic poetry, as opposed to the fixed forms and\ngenres of the verse or chant of precapitalist societies\u2014is its mission\nto overcome the reification of everyday language. Modern poetry emerges\nfrom the inarticulacy of people in contemporary capitalist society. Over\nagainst their sense of the \"seriality\" of daily life and daily speech,\nthat is, the feeling that the center is always elsewhere, that this\nlanguage belongs not to us who use it, but to someone else, in distant\ncenters of production of the media, publishing, and the like, over against\nthis sense of the draining away to some absent center of the very power\nto speak, modern poetry reasserts its production of language and reinvents\na center. The very difficulty of modern poetry is in direct proportion\nto the degree of reification of everyday speech; and the simplicity of\nmuch of poetry today, in the tradition of William Carlos Williams, is\nitself a second-degree phenomenon which builds on the complexity of the\nfirst wave of poetic modernism.\n\n     But if this is the case, then what is striking is not the vast gap\n\n\nbetween theoretical jargon and poetic speech, but rather the similarity\nof the situations they face and the dilemmas they have to overcome. The\npoets and the theoreticians are both at work desperately in an increasingly\nconstricted network of reifying processes, and both violently have recourse\nto invented speech and private languages in order to reopen a space in\nwhich to breathe. That they should not recognize their mutual interests\nin each other, that they should, as in the mirror, take each other\u2019s image\nfor that of the Other or the enemy, is itself only one of the more advanced\nruses of reification, the way capitalism works to separate its subjects\nfrom each other and imprison them in the specialized compartments of their\nown apparently isolated activities.\n\nFREDRIC JAMESON\n\n"},{"uid":"RonaldJohnson_BasilBuntingTakeaChiseltoWrite_1978","author":"Ronald Johnson","shortTitle":"Basil Bunting: \"Take a Chisel to Write\"","title":"Ronald Johnson | Basil Bunting: \"Take a Chisel to Write\" | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn5\/pictures\/024.html","text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBASIL BUNTING: \"TAKE A CHISEL TO WRITE\"\n\n \"What fun if you were a classic!\" Gerard Manley Hopkins once wrote blithely\nthe to-be poet laureate Robert Bridges.

How forms which perservere specifically through\nand for the narrow range of private imagination into world into art into\nlanguage are located in it by a tripartite of form, taste, value. Herein\nthe status of form is exact-inexact possibility towards object-status\n(objectn^ss), and is intimately bound-up with a separatedness of cogito\/\ncogitato that is vanquished (rendered artificial, parasitic) by the basic\n\n\nphenomenology of intuited ontic reach. Any status for form-as-object in\nthis context ultimately involves value(s) that cohere to but are not part\nof (in) the sensuous world. Taste, then, as the perception that replaces\nmere recognition, shares its way of knowing (determining) significance\nin form with value, and becomes the sole, tenuous qualifier of that value.\nAs such, value becomes the problematic of quality through its relative\ncontradistinct to its \u2019virtual\u2019 determination: if form can only be dis-\ncussed in terms of culture (Dewey rightly notes), then the value of that\nform can only be computed through the strictly relative methodologies\nof what is crucial to that culture, not, obviously, what is \u2019virtual\u2019.\nAnd insofar as this instinct towards virtuallity falsifies itself in the\nnegating mechanisms of time-bound culture, the status of the formal object\nmust be prehended by relative qualities which are, indeed, totally crucial\nto knowing it. The bad faith of archeology is exposed here as the most\npedestrian sort of substandard atavism: the conviction that (W)ill\nontologically and epistemologically endures into a meaning that endures\ninto the impossible synthesis of benign matter as significant form.\n\nReflexivity (as intent) cannot transfer intact (as, for, of-itself) beyond\ncogito into form, and is as such inexcavible. To grant virtuality pre-\nhensive rather than fantastic condition is to replace the taste of another\nEra for the taste of one\u2019s own and belies the unrefined bankruptcy of the\nnotion of succession.\n\n     The identity of any Epoch is the quality of those minds that apply\nthe constant effort of knowing and fabricating to a world absented of the\nevidence of unity and languoring in ellipsis. Distinct from the Positivist\nmode, which reduces the aesthetic standards of culture to a structure of\nplay, this view simply arbitrates the products of intuition (imagination)\nwith the consequence of (R)eason: the making of discrete form in time\nas the epitomization of an energy that is distinctly discarnate, subjec-\ntive, a prodigality that bears signification in both the lie and the\ntruth of temporality, excluding the bogus conceit of formist contiguity.\n\nANDREW KELLY"},{"uid":"RobertKelly_LettertotheEditor_1979","author":"Robert Kelly","shortTitle":"Letter to the Editor","title":"Robert Kelly | Letter to the Editor | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn8\/pictures\/025.html","text":"\n\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR\n\nThe book survey in No. 7 is focused in a way no \u2019reviews\u2019 we see ever\nare; the use of texts is at stake, and people\u2019s reflections on what\nstirs them are in turn of next-generation usefulness.

Fact as the rain that renews the air of theory.\n\nGregory Dix, The Shape of the Liturgy, a beautiful study of the dia-\nchronic, a gesture shaping for nineteen hundred years.\n\nGeorges Bataille, to wander in the complete works now coming out,\nespecially L'Histoire de 1\u2019Oeil, Le Bleu du ciel (which I\u2019ve read in a\nwonderful private translation by Paul Auster and Lydia Davis), L\u2019anus\nsolaire.

(Marxian philology reborn.)\nUmberto Eco, Theory of Semiotics.\n\n\nHillman, ReVisioning Psychology.\n\nCardew, Stockhausen serves Imperialism (a book so savage in its attack\n    on our avant-garde preoccupations and airs that it seems to be kept\n    out of this country altogether, whereas the same author\u2019s earlier\n    conformist Scratch Music is widely circulated.)\n\nTarthang Tulku, Time Space Knowledge, a casting of Buddhist analytic\n    and synthetic into the american language.\n\nMarx and Engels, The German Ideology: the orchestra tuning, the wind\n    rising.\n\nHeidegger, What is called thinking and Discourse on Thinking.\nAnd ever useful (now I own a copy all the more so):\nOnians, The Origins of European Thought (Arno reprint).\n\nAnd I do not want to leave out of the record those books which are not\nheld in the hand, namely the texts of light:\nHollis Frampton, Zorn\u2019s Lemma\nHerzog\u2019s Kasper Hauser\n\nTanner\u2019s Jonah who will be 25 in the year 2000.\n\nAnd, to match Benjamin at the beginning, this very great film which I\nfinally saw only two years ago:\n\nVertov, Man with Movie Camera.

Ives\u2019 ideas\non Emerson and others, as well as on music, are expressed with the same\nintense individuality as Ives\u2019 music itself. Unfortunately, \"editor\"\nBoatwright totally butchered Ives\u2019 style, by changing punctuation (as\nthough Ives wouldn\u2019t know how to use devices like commas, which in the\ntranscription of language can be and often are obviously musical signs)\nand even rewriting phrases and sentences. This destroyed my misconcep-\ntions that editors only fuck with the work of relatively unknowns. Boat-\nwright defends this stupidity in his introduction with statements like\nthis: \"A literal printing of the manuscript (if such a thing were possi-\nble, considering the number of alternate words and marginal notes) would\nbe no more than a curiosity, and unfair in its emphasis on the eccen-\ntricity of Ives\u2019 style, which has nothing to do with the seriousness of\nhis thought.\" Possibly the most enlightening book I\u2019ve read in years is\nA Distant Mirror by Barbara Tuchman (Alfred Knopf, 1978). An equally\nenlightening book, and for me it served as a fresh and beautifully\nwritten reminder of a period and its culture that greatly influenced my\nwriting and thinking for years (throughout most of the 1960s), is The\nWorld of the Shining Prince: Court Life in Ancient Japan by Ivan Morris,\n(Penguin Books, paperback $2.95). Morris describes one of the most\nunusual eras in any society\u2019s cultural history\u2014the Japanese Heian\nperiod \u2014 which boasted a sensibility almost \"terminally mannered\" (to\nparaphrase John Ashbery\u2019s description of .a novel by Edmund White, Forget-\nting Helena, which in fact borrowed heavily from the literature of\nHeian Japan). The last book on my list, Lions and Shadows, An Autobio-\ngraphical Novel by Christopher Isherwood (New Directions paperback\n$3.45, 1977) gave me valuable insights into a.kind of life and lifestyle\nI could never really understand, let alone appreciate, since it repre-\nsented everything I saw as oppressive by the standards of my background\n\n\nand family history (i.e. it is the English upper-classes who have always\nrepresented for us the worst aspects of oppressive political and social\nsystems). Isherwood translates his and Auden\u2019s schoolboy and young man\nexperiences into something I can try on imaginatively while I\u2019m reading.\nIn fact, Isherwood is in some ways in his prose like W. C. Wil Hama is in\nhis poetry \u2014 relying on the concrete details and experiences of the\nlocal in time and space and syntax to convey the idea(s). Both are\/were\nmore ot less sympathetic dudes from the upper or upper-middle class, and\nwhere the good doctor got down in a way through ministering and learning\nfrom the lower classes, Isherwood ministered in his own way through his\nattraction to lower class men. Though I enjoyed the much more \u2019\u2019candid\u201d\nreminiscences in the later Christopher and His Kind (and the guts it\ntook to do it, after all the man is one of the few of his stature to\nbe so honest about his sexuality as well as other things) Lions and\nShadows intrigued and educated me more because of the ways it tells\nsome of the same things only from a younger man in a more repressed\nperiod and about a more innocent and naive, as well as blatantly privi-\nleged, time in his life. (I might Just add that reading Eva Hesse by\nLucy Lippard, New York University Press, confirmed a lot of the origi-\nnal inspiration I felt when I first encountered her work, as well as\nleft me with a sense of urgency about completing a lot of my work and\nfulfilling my ideas and intentions and all.)\n"},{"uid":"MichaelLally_ThePoliticsofPoetry_1979","author":"Michael Lally","shortTitle":"The Politics of Poetry","title":"Michael Lally | The Politics of Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/028.html","text":"MICHAEL LALLY\n\n\nOne \u2019\u2019quality\u201d that \u2019\u2019comes to mind\u201d is \u2014 to isolate and describe and\nrecord exact observations about \u2019\u2019experience\u201d and \u2019\u2019objects\u201d that other-\nwise are never shared beyond intimate relationships because they offer\nan alternative perspective to \u2019\u2019reality\u201d than the one the \u2019\u2019capitalist\u201d\nsystem (and maybe any \u2019\u2019generally\u201d applied \u2019\u2019system\u201d) imposes through its\ncontrol of the distribution of \u2019\u2019goods,\u201d including \u2019\u2019art\u201d and \u2019\u2019language\u201d\nand other supposedly less \u2019\u2019essential\u201d \u2019\u2019goods.\u201d Honesty is still, in my\nopinion, one of the most revolutionary \u2019\u2019forces\u201d or \u2019\u2019weapons\u201d we always\nhave \u201dat our disposal.\u201d\n\n\n"},{"uid":"MichaelLally_ThreeNewPoets_1978","author":"Michael Lally","shortTitle":"Three \"New\" Poets","title":"Michael Lally | Three \"New\" Poets | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn2\/pictures\/008.html","text":"\n\n\nTHREE \"NEW\u201d POETS\n\nDonald Quatrale, Genitals (1977; $2 from Bosom Press, 17 Hemenway St.,\nBoston, MA 02115), and The Factory Dances (1977; $4 from The Four Zoas\nPress, RFD, Ware, MA 01082).\n\nDiane Ward, Trop-i-dom (1977, Jawbone; $2 from Folio Books, 2000 P St.,\nN.W., Washington, D.C. 20036).\n\nCarole Korzeniowsky, Breastwork (1977; $1.50 from Korzeniowsky, 11\nEast 7th St., N.Y., N.Y. 10003).\n\n1.\n\nDonald Quatrale\u2019s Genitals instigated this piece. His 2nd book. His 1st\nengagingly well-focused: The Factory Dances. Genitals has more poems, so\npeaks & ebbs more pronounced and have a wider context as basis of support\nand\/or contrast. Not necessarily erotic or sexual, rarely even sensual,\nbut some attention to physical properties, descriptive qualities. The\ntechnique mainly assemblage (which reminded me of the other 2 poets\n\n\n\nwhat they have in common is the ease and looseness with which they approach\nthis way of structuring a poem \u2014 in \"my generation\" only the W.C. Williams\nmode afforded my contemporaries the same casual, easy grace and good\nfeelings \u2014 whereas assemblage as such created often self-righteously &\ntherefore often stiff poetry-as-work ethic). Quatrale perhaps most of\nthese 3 in need of a sharp editorial sense to make poem do better what it\ndoes and the poet intended, without silly self-indulgence to ego-clever-\nness. But he has a kind of elan about the presentation of his voice which\nbacked by the rhythmic strength of the construction alone creates a\nmovement hard to resist & which gives me pleasure (and I still like to get\npleasure from my reading no matter how it\u2019s generated or what the other\neffects\n\n\n\n        and it was a pleasure to read Diane Ward\u2019s Trop-i-dom. Also a 2nd\nbook (unless there\u2019s more); the 1st a collection of 1 poem On Duke Eiling-\nton's Birthdaywhich displayed truly down to earth wit (in 50s hip jargon\n\"down\" was a descriptive term, usually complimentary, for anyone or thing\ntruly down to earth as opposed to 60s hippy jargon when it became a noun\nto describe a state of being not all that desirable, etc.). On Duke also\nshowcased Ward\u2019s fine ear for the musical basis of the language when we\nbase the flow of it on the extension of the breath. She could be\nhonoring, more subtly, \"ol\u2019 blue eyes.\" Sinatra\u2019s mastering of extended\nphrasing, learned from watching one of the Dorsey\u2019s (can\u2019t remember which\nis which) play, was one of his distinguishing features as \"vocalist.\"\nStringing phrases or vowels together for an extended musical space was a\npuzzle Dorsey helped explain by teaching him to inhale ever so slightly\nthrough the side of the mouth, where the lips join, just the least\nopening and the most minimal intake could add moments as though all one\nexhalation. Ward approximates that in On Duke\u2083 a string of phrases\ndescribing activities & gestures of the day in her life & lives of the\nworld. It doesn\u2019t compete with the extended sentence (of say Kerouac,\nwhose inspiration was also jazz soloists who \"blew\" long \"crazy\" riffs\nwith what seemed like one breath) because her phrases are really\nsentences only connected in rhythm & logical continuity by choice of words\nthat leaves no doubt where they\u2019re going making them seem dependent on\nwhat follows creating the phraselike effect. In Trop-i-dom the intention\nseems altogether different. No pretensions to glib detachment from\naesthetic concerns mar either, but Trop achieves the impact of a declara-\ntion in control of rhythm alone. It\u2019s poetry because it sounds like\npoetry in my brain when I read it, falling under the spell of its move-\nment & rhythms unreproducable in musical terms on any instrument but\nespecially the voice; their music is poetry (i.e. they couldn\u2019t be\ntranslated into the post-Patti Smith fashion of \"the beat\" as foundation\nfor rhythmic extension. They are instead based solidly on syntactical\n\n\nrelationships that only work when they make the reader\/audience concen-\ntrate on the language, not the music). The language is the music.\n\n3.\n\n                                                                    Not as\ncompellingly \"musical\u201d is Carole Korzeniowsky\u2019s Breastwork, a tour de\nforce that is a 1st book. These rhythms are based on more familiar\nprose & conversational structures. The basic unit is the sentence, not\nthe phrase or as phrase. But the relationship of the sentences is\nintended to draw us into poetic concerns for the language as other than\nprosaic or logic ridden. Yet, in the end, this work seems most dependent\non logic to work, and it does work, hard & well. (The other 2 poets use\nthe audience\u2019s capacity or potential to \u2019\u2019intuit\u201d meaning, in ways similar\nto those we use to intuit knowledge from our surroundings & experiences\n\u2014 no neon morals and\/or conclusions flash on and off in the brain, just\naccumulation of sensory and\/or conceptual data leads to the evolution of\nconclusive ideas about what it all is & can mean to\/for us. Breastwork\nmeanwhile seems to depend on a more contrived approach to gaining know-\nledge, one traditionally misconstrued as the traditional, main, or only\nway. In other words it moves as if teaching us something that can be\ntaught by the very force of the continuous logic of the presentation of\nrelated ideas through the accuracy of referential terminology. While\n\"in fact\" it totally disengages the continuity of logical structures \u2014\nbut in that continuity\u2019s terms, so we are left feeling as though we\u2019ve\nbeen introduced to an area of \"knowledge\" we hadn\u2019t known before about a\nsubject matter we had. The concepts are \"abstract\" in their purity as\nmuch as any in \"new\" music: not simple or straightforward as they appear\nbut only structured as conclusively step-by-step directional and\nconclusory. I mean she tells us information while recreating a poetic\nkind of pleasure in the experiencing of it, that pleasure is often the\nsustenance of language.\n\nMICHAEL LALLY\n\n"},{"uid":"GerritLansing_NonPoetry_1979","author":"Gerrit Lansing","shortTitle":"Non-Poetry","title":"Gerrit Lansing | Non-Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/023.html","text":"\nGERRIT LANSING :\n\nBlood, Benjamin Paul, Pluriverse, Marshall Jones Co, Boston, 1920.\n\nShea, Robert, and Wilson, Robert Anton, Illumlnatus, Vols.

Baudrillard stands firmly in the line marked French post-\nMarxist critique, following upon and engaged with, often in disagreement, Althusser, Deleuze and\nGuattari, and Julia Kristeva.\n\n        His announced theme, an attempt to analyze the central logic of political economy, its logic\nof signification, has itself been much analyzed, his revisions of Marx predictably dismissed as\n'Romantic' or 'utopian,' (see, e.g., the review of 'Baudrillard's Noble Anthropology' by Robert\nHefner, sub stance 17, 1977), but this note is only concerned to show that some of his insights\nconcerning art, play, work, language, and the concept of 'Nature' are worth attending:\n\n        'The work of art and to a certain extent the artisanal work bear in them the inscription of the\nloss of the finality of the subject and the object, the radical compatibility of life and death, the play of\nan ambivalence that the product of labor as such does not bear since it has inscribed in it only the\nfinality of value.' Language is no more only a 'means' of 'communication,' than a tool is only a\n'means' of 'production.'\n\n        On the ways in which notions of value are covertly introduced into the metaphorical\nmachinery of Marxist (and other political-economic) \u00e9criture, Baudrillard is acute. He questions and\nattacks the metaphorical identification of value and productivity common to Marx and Deleuze, runs\nover the history of that intersection (incidentally pointing out the unhistorical dreaminess of\nKristeva's view of Marx: 'If there was one thing Marx did not think about, it was discharge, waste,\nsacrifice, prodigality, play, and symbolism.') The notion of the good of 'productivity' or 'creativity' is\ncommon to Marx and the Christian 'Puritan ethic,' and Baudrillard in his chapter on \u2018Marxist\nAnthropology and the Domination of Nature' sketches a history of 'the rewriting of Nature\naccording to the code of production.'\n\n        Although Nature in all political-economic writing expresses the concept of a dominated\nessence, \u2018This separation from Nature under the sign of the principle of production is fully realized by\nthe capitalist system of political economy, but obviously it does not emerge with political economy.\nThe separation is rooted in the great Judeo-Christian dissociation of the soul and Nature. God\ncreated man in his image and created Nature for man's use.' In Baudrillard's view, it is here, in the\n\n\nexploitation of Nature by human being according to God's will that 'Rationality begins ... it is the\nend of paganism, animism and the \"magical\" immersion of man in nature, all of which is\nreinterpreted as superstition. (\"Rational\" Marxism makes the same error by reinterpreting it in terms\nof the \"rudimentary\" development of productive forces.) Hence although science, technology and\nmaterial production subsequently enter into contradiction with the cultural order and the dogmas of\nChristianity, nonetheless their condition of possibility remains the Christian postulate of man's\ntranscendence of nature.'\n\n         So from a Christian ascetic ethic of suffering and self-mortification it is but one giant step,\nchanging nothing in the principles of repression and operational violence, to the work ethic of\nmaterial domination and production: 'From ascetic practices to productive practices (and from the\nlatter to consumer practices) there is thus desublimation; but the desublimation is only a\nmetamorphosis of repressive sublimation. The ethical dimension is secularized under the sign of the\nmaterial domination of nature,' and the whole system of political economy, unquestioned in Marxist\ncritique of capitalism, remains a 'secular generalization of the Christian axiom about Nature.'\n\n         Poster remarks (his name is Mark) in his 'Introduction' that '... contemporary French\ntheorists remain trapped in this conceptual cage ['a metaphor or \"mirror\" of production']: Althusser\nsees theory as \"production,\" Deleuze and Guattari give us an unconscious that is a \"producer\" of\ndesire, the Tel Quel group refers to textual \"production\".\n\n         Baudrillard would like to break, to have broken, the mirror-metaphor of production, to\nradicalize Marx's concepts of value: 'Kristeva would gladly be rid of value, but neither labor nor\nMarx. One must choose. Labor is defined (anthropologically and historically) as what disinvests the\nbody and social exchange of all ambivalent and symbolic qualities, reducing them to a rational,\npositive, unilateral investment. The productive Eros represses all the alternative qualities of meaning\nand exchange in symbolic discharge toward a process of production, accumulation, and\nappropriation. In order to question the process which submits us to the destiny of political economy\nand the terrorism of value, and to rethink discharge and symbolic exchange, the conceptions of\nproduction and labor developed by Marx (not to mention political economy) must be resolved and\nanalyzed as ideological concepts interconnected with the general system of value. And in order to find\na realm beyond economic value (which is in fact the only revolutionary perspective), then the mirror\nof production in which all Western metaphysics is reflected, must be broken.\u2019\n\n\u2022\n\nIt is possible that the seeds of a new conception of human being in nature can be found even in\ncertain Western sources, occulted until the 'Renaissance' by the 'collective consciousness' of the\nWest, arcane in its Canon.\n\n\n        In Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale Polixenes tells the somewhat perplexed Perdita (perplexed\nby Gardens; as Robert Smithson says, 'Too much thinking about \"gardens\" leads to perplexity and\nagitation.'), \n\t      Yet Nature is made better by no mean         \n              But Nature makes that mean; so, over that art\n              Which you say adds to Nature, is an art      \n              That Nature makes ...                        \n\n\n"},{"uid":"RogerLaporte_fromFugue_1980","author":"Roger Laporte","shortTitle":"from Fugue","title":"Roger Laporte | from Fugue | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn13\/pictures\/042.html","text":"\nfrom FUGUE\n\n ... What precisely would the work to be written be about if it was\nconcerned with a game? We would have to play and write the Treatise on\nthat game at the same time, or, more exactly, the game itself would\nconsist of writing the Treatise on the game. How is it played? I\ncannot apply the rules of a treatise which does not yet exist! A solu-\ntion is possible: that   the elaboration of the treatise be an integral\npart of the execution. The match has not yet taken place, I shall never\nhave the peaceful role   of pure spectator, and that is why it is neces-\nsary, to begin by playing, by provoking and observing the movements,\neven if it later entails reconstituting from the traces of other, at\nfirst unnoticed, movements.... I must do the work of a discoverer more\nthan an inventor, and yet the reading alone cannot act as the developer\nin the photographic sense of that term, for the history, far from being\nalready fully accomplished, will be able to be read only in so far as\nit will be inscribed, as if the memory of the book was offering it that\nplace and time of which it would till then have been deprived....\n\n     I would wish the mind, substituting itself for \"I\", to show itself,\nmanifest its own movement openly, speak its own language directly, but\nthe mind, a detestable word that I must soon replace, not given in any\n\n\nimmediate understanding, not speaking but writing, must be furnished\nthe possibility of leaving a trace: the white sheet ready to become\nscriptogramme. The most simple metaphor, hardly a metaphor, is thus\nthat of a mobile or a machine, equipped with a kind of seismographic\nstylet which would change position, marking its movement, which would\nbe described by that procedure as essential and characteristic as that\nof a piece in a chess game. To compare a book to a seismogramme is a\nmistaken analogy in so far as, I know from experience, simple registering\nis not involved, and indeed everything happens as if the sheet of paper\nwas a rebel matter not allowing itself to be easily cut into by the\nwriter\u2019s stylet. I therefore correct my definition: the mind (a term\nthe reader would really like to read henceforth under an erasure) is\nthis mobile which can only change its position by clearing a path and\nconsequently by inscribing itself, by necessarily leaving a trace:...\nHow can I make the reader participate in the discontinuity of the\nwriting? How can I do it in such a way that the legato of the reading\nis broken by the spasms of the writing?... One experiences a kind of\ndizziness when, having suddenly believed one is touching the centre of\nthe target, one passes just to one side, a slight error which soon\ndraws one to the very outside, and yet this slight shift, this kind of\ndislocation which separates me from my references and puts a check on\nmy schemes, sets me at the same time onto some new project.... Contrary\nto what I supposed, to write a book is not a game which would consist\nof drawing up the rules of this game, and indeed, in admitting that\nwriting is a game, it will never be able to purify itself, to sum itself\nup in a Treatise.... Opposing what provisionally, and for want of\nbetter, I shall call my writing, since it is placed black on white by\nthe one who says \"I\", there is indeed I do not know what hostile white-\nness which empties my writing, disconnects it from itself, a whitening\nwhich obliterates in advance what I might have written, ousts me unceas-\ningly from what I have thus no right to call my writing: that ray, that\nrift, that furrow, which I will call counter-writing, even though re-\npeating that such pain is surely my only chance.... Everything happens\nas if the work was the place of confrontation between an inside and an\noutside, between writing and counter-writing, an adversary that it\nwould however be unjust to consider an enemy of the work since without\nit the work would geometrise, crystallise in a Treatise which, though\nperfect, would nonetheless signify for the work, purified in the \"fin-\nished work\", mortal immobility.... .\n\n     Though it must weigh the most serious threats on the work, counter-\nwriting is not exterior to a text which would not be constituted without\nit, on which, in which, it leaves its imprint, it touches writing at\nits very heart. The mobile, figure of writing, does not change position\naccording to a rectilinear course till the moment when it would be de-\nflected by an alien resistance, but counter-writing is always at work,\nbringing the writer into play whilst placing the one who says \"I\" out-\n\n\nside the game, occupying the heartless heart of the writing. Every\nwriter represents his craft in the form of a clearing a way, and yet,in\nhis very act, writing is also and at the same time, of a deep-seated\npassivity: the act of writing, in so far as it is a receptive surface,\nis therefore always concerned with the heart of its activity.... When\nI hold myself at a distance from these two extremes: the ease of dis-\ncussion and the dry pain of exclusion, when I write, that is to say\nwhen the writer simultaneously decides to open a way and to accept\nbeing put in play, being carried along to the unknown and perhaps to\nlose himself, there is not on the one hand the rectitude or the rigour\nof a breakthrough and on the other a strength so perniciously misleading\nthat one finds oneself off the track without knowing why, without having\nmade a mistake, so disorientated that one no longer knows where one is\nat all, turned about to the point of losing one\u2019s own trace, but the\nstill-veiled way plays around its absent axis and thus the clearing a\nway, although one only becomes aware of it afterwards, is directly a\nmisconduct: this use, this warping of falsely continued traces, is the in-\ndiscernable work of the writing and the counter-writing to such an\nextent that the latter could be given the name of writing and vice\nversa....\n\n\n(Excerpted and reordered from Glenda George's translation of Fugue \u2014\nGallimard, 1970\u2014in Split Curtains, 4 Bower Street, Maidstone, Kent,\nEngland.)\n\n\nROGER LAPORTE"},{"uid":"SusanBeeLaufer_Photograms_1978","author":"Susan Bee Laufer","shortTitle":"Photograms","title":"Susan Bee Laufer | Photograms | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn2\/pictures\/016.html","text":"\n\n   PHOTOGRAMS\n\n       \"The illiterates of the future will be ignorant of camera and\n        pen alike. \u2014 Laszl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy\n\n       \"The photogram, or cameraless record of forms produced by light,\n        which embodies the unique nature of the photographic process, is\n        the real key to photography. It allows us to capture the patterned\n        interplay of light on a sheet of sensitized paper without recourse\n        to any apparatus. The photogram opens up perspectives of a\n        hitherto wholly unknown morphoais governed by optical laws\n        peculiar to itself. It is the most completely dematerialized\n        medium that the new vision commands.\u00b9\u00b9\n\n                    \u2014 Moholy-Nagy, 1932\n\n    Photography was for a time considered only a mechanical means of recording\n   and documenting. While this quality of photography is widely held to\n   have released painters from realistic depiction, the photogram represents\n   the melding, rather than the separation, of the two traditions. The chief\n   proponents and discoverers of the photogram, Man Ray and Moholy-Nagy, both\n   turned from painting to photography and the discovery of the photogrammic\n   technique (c. 1920-1922). These two pioneers, bringing to photography\n   painterly concerns, questioned the purely documentary nature of photo-\n   graphy. As Brecht wrote, \"Less than ever does a simple reproduction of\n   reality express something about reality.\" Photograms combine the direct-\n   ness inherent in the application of paint to canvas with the basic\n   characteristics of the photo-process: light and the tones produced on\n   light-sensitive paper. With photograms the question of taking pictures\n   does not arise: the whole process can be confined to the darkroom.\n\n    Photograms are a form of bricollage. Bits of scraps, cotton, buttons,\n   etc.,\u2014materials \"ready to hand\"\u2014are collaged together and transformed\n   with the product often having no outward relationship to the elements\n   that formed it. In the darkroom these captured images live. What\n\n\n    remains on the paper is the residue of the objects\u2014their shadows\u2014the\n   predominant effect is a lack of gravity\u2014of lunar traces\u2014ghosts of\n   objects a capturing of a fleeting imprint of light passing through an\n   object surrounding it, transformed by it.\n\n  Cameraless pictures serve as direct light diagrams, recording the actions\n  of light over a period of time, the motion of light in space. The photo-\n  gram produces space without existing spatial structure by articulation on\n  the plane of the paper with half-tones of black, gray and white. It is a\n  writing and drawing with light.\n\n  The typical feature of the photogram is instability; the image can only\n  be preserved momentarily before it changes. \"The object being, for the\n  sake of curiosity, to create a fresh problem, or to place a new obstacle\n  in the path of light like a straw dropped across the path of an ant.\"\n  (G. C. Argan) Each instance is made particular by the translucent, trans-\n  parent, or opaque qualities of the objects and the angle of the light rays\n  to the paper.\n\n  For Man Ray and Moholy-Nagy, automatic writing, Dadaist collages, Stein,\n  Schwitters, Breton, Cubism, Surrealist writing, etc., all provided an\n  analogy for this proposed new vision of photography. Moholy-Nagy\n  encouraged photographers to liberate themselves from rendering and\n  illusionism and open themselves up to synthetic composition. Light\n  itself would function as the kind of creative agent that pigment is for\n  the painter. \"If we can see in the genuine elements of photography the\n  self-sufficient vehicle for direct, visual impact based on the properties\n  of the light-sensitive emulsion then we may be nearer to \u2019art\u2019 in the\n  field of photography.\" (Moholy-Nagy).\n\n  Beaumont Newhall has written, \"The photogram makers\u2019 problem has nothing\n  to do with interpreting the world, but rather with the formation of\n  abstractions. Objects are chosen for their light-modulating characteris-\n  tics: their reality and significance disappear. The logical end point of\n  the photogram is the reduction of photography to the light-recording\n  property of silver salts. To the cameraman this is what Malevich\u2019s White\n  on White is to the painter.\"\n\nSUSAN BEE LAUFER\n\n\n\n  (Many of Moholy-Nagy\u00b9 s books stress the interrelationship of the visual\n  and literary arts and the value of visual artists studying the achieve-\n  ments of Stein, Joyce, the constructivists, etc., particularly*\u2014Painting\n  Photography, & Film (MIT Press, 1969) and Vision in Motion (Paul\n  Theobald, 1947).\n"},{"uid":"SusanBeeLaufer_RuschasBooksandSeriality_1979","author":"Susan Bee Laufer","shortTitle":"Ruscha's Books and Seriality","title":"Susan Bee Laufer | Ruscha's Books and Seriality | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/008.html","text":"\n            RUSCHA\u2019S BOOKS AND SERIALITY\n\n\n\"Nothing is of greater moment than the knowledge that the choice of one\nmoment excludes another, that no moment makes up for another, that the\nsignificance of one moment is the cost of what it forgoes. \"\n\n\"One might say that the task is no longer to produce another instance of\nan art but a new medium within it. (Here is the relevance of series in\nmodern painting and sculpture, and of cycles in movies, and of the\nquest for 'sound' in jazz and rock.) A new medium establishes and is\nestablished by a series... any change (of an angle, a shift in color\nor a color's width, or its distance from another color) would simply\ncreate a new instance, an absolutely new painting.\"\n\n\u2014 Stanley Cavell, in The World Viewed\n\nEd Ruscha\u2019s books document seemingly mundane but archetypal images\u2014gas\nstations, apartment buildings, parking lots, vacant lots, the Sunset\nStrip, swimming pools, palm trees. The general structure is a series of\nsnapshot-like photos of the same type of object. Cohesion is achieved\nthrough a programmatic, seemingly mechanical seriality. This use of\nseriality in Nine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass creates not a world\nof time unfolding but a world of time flattened. Images are juxtaposed\nin which the time of day in each is elusively distinct\u2014a shadow cast\nleftward in one, then rightward, changes in the quality of light, varia-\ntions in the profusion of reflections: overall, an eeriness of \"no time,\"\nan uncanniness. Each image is cropped and framed so as to exclude\nextraneous matter that would distract from the time, space, and photo-\ngraphic blueness of the pools. In this work, seriality does not create\na linear movement forward or backward\u2014as in a Muybridge movement series.\nTime, removed from its sequentiality, is left to float fancifully, airily\non the surface of the reflecting water.\n\nPhotography often imparts to the objects photographed an increased\nparticularity. Weston\u2019s \"Pepper\" has greater sensuality, texture, shape\nthan we normally perceive in a pepper. In Ruscha\u2019s work, each object is\ntransformed into something less than itself by becoming an instance of a\ngenre. Thus the esthetic impetus is transferred from the single image\nto the series. Ruscha keeps a fixed angle of gaze on each gas station\nand swimming pool, and as the pages of the book are turned, it is as if\nthe object is being transformed through slight changes in the structure\nof the image. The individual image is subverted in favor of the overall\nmovement so that the book form becomes a medium for seriality in which\nthese frames are situated in terms of context and type, with greater\ncomplexity than otherwise.\n\nWithin the medium of still photography, use has often been made of the\nserial nature of film. Photographers will take numerous shots of the\n\n\nsame subject, so that a contact sheet will show many aspects of the\nsame image. This seriality is an automatism inherent to film. The phy-\nsical layout of a roll of film establishes relationships among the\nimages. While a still photographer can choose different frames from the\nroll, thus eliminating links consciously or unconsciously made in the\nshooting, in motion pictures the seriality and linkage, speeded up in\nprojection, is essential. Speed and motion create a tableau so that the\nindividual images become harder to focus on and instead we are caught\nup in action pictures or more literally moving pictures.\n\nIn film, Walter Benjamin writes, \"the meaning in each single picture\nappears prescribed by the preceding ones.\u201d Still photos can focus on\ndifferent aspects of duration than film by isolating a specific moment\nor presenting a linear sequence. In Ruscha\u2019s selective choice of images,\nthe distances between the sites of the gas stations, etc., seem like\nblank spaces making these books more like catalogues or surveys\u2014spatial\nrather than temporal sequences.\n\nRuscha, finally, seems to be invoking the power of photography as such\nand film as such. The still photographic image exists as a moment in\ntime encapsulated, as time literally framed.\n\n        (Ruscha\u2019s books include Every Building on Sunset Strip (1966)^ Thirty-\n        Four Parking Lots (1967) \u2083 Fine Swimming Pools (1968)and A Few Palm\n        Trees (1971).\n\n                                                  SUSAN B.

He seems to\nthink it\u2019s up to the rest of us to sense from the context of his remarks\nthe nature of this preferred society and program. He certainly sounds like\nsome kind of Leninist, and since most Leninists are either some kind of\nStalinist or some kind of Trotskyist, I don\u2019t think he should be surprised\nthat I treated his remarks as coming from an adherent of one of those\npositions.\n\n     (I might add that I don\u2019t find the two positions basically dissimilar\nin the light of Trotsky\u2019s actions when in power, such as his takeover of\nthe railway unions\u2014 ending what seems to have been a surprisingly suc-\ncessful worker organization and management of the railway system of much\nof European Russia and turning it over to Bolshevik bureaucrats and\nbourgeois managers\u2014 and his bloody repression of the Kronstadt sailors.)\nMoreover, Silliman\u2019s use of the terms \"social democrat\" and \"anarcho-\nsocial democrat\" as pejorative epithets for such diverse pacifists as\nmyself and the group editing and producing Win magazine is only paralleled\nin my experience by such usage in the mouths and writings of Stalinists\n(using the term in the very general sense which includes supporters of all\noligarchic state \"socialisms,\" including those founded by Mao, Tito, and\nCastro) and Trotskyists. Ron\u2019s remarks imply that he is neither\u2014 and I\nbelieve him\u2014 but he does not make clear the nature of the \"working-class\nstate\" idealism he does espouse, beyond saying that he endorses the concept\nof a dictatorship of a working class that has somehow seized state power.\n\n     Ron seems to believe that such a state would allow him to continue\nto write and publish his kind of poetry and to reach the predominantly\nmiddle-class male audience he now addresses. I find this both touching\nand mind-boggling. Why in the world does he think that a working-class\ndictatorship would be so unlike other dictatorships, including the party\noligarchies now ruling many countries in the name of the working class?\n\n     If the working class in this country should seize and exercise state\npower\u2014even in the best manner conceivable: \"as a whole,\" in the form\nof workers\u2019 councils or the like\u2014why would it tolerate the continuance\nof bourgeois art activities such as Ron\u2019s or mine, even though such activ-\nities constitute implied critiques of alienated language usage? This\nwould require that a bourgeois society would have educated its working\nclass to such a level that a majority would understand that such art activ-\nities were in harmony with (or at least not opposed to) its revolutionary\naims. If such were the case, the revolution itself would have largely\n\n\nbeen a mere formality. The presumably \"bourgeois\" social system which\nit had overthrown would already have embodied most \u2014 or at least many \u2014\nof the goals of the revolution.\n\n     I just don\u2019t believe it. It seems much more probable that a revolu-\ntionary working-class dictatorship would consider language experimentation\nan undesirable remnant of the old bourgeois state of things and would\nsuppress it along with other vestiges of the old order. I believe that\nan attitude such as Amiri Baraka\u2019s toward \"bourgeois art\" would be likely\nto be enforced by even an internally democratic working-class dictator-\nship. At best it might \"tolerate\" such activity as long as it remained\nperipheral and private\u2014 a kind of \"hobby\" to be pursued in time not\ndevoted to societally approved productive work.\n\n     But the likelihood that language artwork would be considered \"produc-\ntive\" or that language artists would be supported for their artwork by a\nworking-class dictatorship seems to me very small indeed. I suspect that\nlanguage artists would have no public support for their work and that pri-\nvate support would be difficult if not impossible to organize. We\u2019d be\neven worse off than we are now.\n\n     My own opinion is that some form of \"Stalinism\" or \"bureaucratic\noligarchy\" would be the probable result of the setting up of any revolu-\ntionary state in the name of the working class. I don\u2019t know whether or\nnot Ron endorses the idea of a vanguard party. Most supporters of a\nworking-class dictatorship do. In any case, I know of no evidence to\nsupport the idea that such a party, if it should gain power, would not\ndevelop into a political-economic \"class\" in whose hands state power would\nconstitute a dictatorship over the working class and everyone else. I can-\nnot understand anyone\u2019s discounting the experience of the last 80 years by\nattributing the existence of the political-economic (\"bureaucratic\") oli-\ngarchies presently controlling so-called socialist states merely to a\ndegenerative disease called \"Stalinism\"\u2014i.e., the evil ways of certain\npower-mad bureaucrats and party leaders.\n\n     Does Ron accept the argument that none of the countries in which such\nrevolutions have taken place were sufficiently developed? \u2014 that true\nsocialism\u2014in which power would somehow be exercised by the working class\n\"as a whole,\" although members of other classes would be excluded from\nexerting political power \u2014 could not have come about yet in any of the\ncountries presently saddled with \"socialist\" oligarchies? \u2014 that only\nadvanced nations such as the United States, Japan, or the EEC could under-\ngo \"real\" socialist revolutions leading to (presumably benevolent) work-\ning-class dictatorships?\n\n     To all arguments for the continuing possibility that a violent\nMarxist-led revolution could lead to a desirable state of society \u2014 one\nin which there would be no poverty, exploitation, or war and in which\npolitical and economic power would be exercised equally by all members of\nsociety, which would, by then, be \"classless\" \u2014 I can only reply with the\nquestion: \"Why do you think so?\"\n\n\n     As against those who have undergone the Marxist gnosis, I do not know\nhow such a society could be brought about or even whether it is possible*\nexcept in part. Ron is quite right in noting that\u2014unlike social demo-\ncrats, by the way, who think they can bring it about by working within\nparliamentary systems to vote in some form of democratically controlled\nstate socialism \u2014 I have no program.\n\n     Milovan Djilas, in The Unperfect Society, radically questions the\nnotion of political activity aimed at bringing about a perfect society.\nI cite his book for this reason and because he includes in it an impres-\nsive refutation of historical (or \"dialectical\") materialism. I have not\nhad the opportunity or time to read Lefevre\u2019s book which Ron cites, so I\ndo not know whether his and Djilas\u2019 arguments are mutually relevant, but,\nas I remember it, Djilas\u2019 refutation is a general one.\n\n     The fact that Djilas was formerly a Stalinist and may still consider\nhimself, in a limited sense of the word, a \"socialist,\" is irrelevant to\nhis exemplification of an \"agnostic\" politics as against the various\nmodern political gnosticisms, \"right\" and \"left.\"\n\n     To say, as Ron does, that a political agnostic is \"ungrounded\" is\neither a tautology (\"not to know\" = \"not to be grounded\") or an unwarranted\nkind of name-calling. To say that I believe in \"maintaining\" poverty,\nexploitation, and war because I don't know of any political economy with-\nout them or any political-economic \"program\" likely to abolish them is an\nastonishing misuse of language.\n\n     I no longer believe that Ron and I share as many \"long-term goals\" as\nI formerly did, since he specifically endorses a dictatorship of the work-\ning class (over those considered outside that class). However, what I\nthought we had in common was a belief in the desirability of ending\npoverty, exploitation, coercion, and war (\"\u2019Capitalism,\"\u2019 writes Lorenzo\ntwo pages away from Ron, \"is a snobbish term for poverty and exploitation.\nA fiction.\") and of maximizing people\u2019s control over their own lives and\nliving and working conditions. To me this implies a maximization of\nopportunities for the exercise of initiative in all areas of life. As\nsuch, these \"goals\" seem equally incompatible with both \"capitalism\" and\n\"socialism\" as we\u2019ve known them hitherto.\n\n     Utopian capitalists (\"libertarians\" such as Murray Rothbard) claim\nthat the oligarchies presently controlling the capitalist world\u2014 the\ninterlocking directorates of the banks, conglomerates, and multinational\ncorporations and the leaders of the political parties, government bureau-\ncracies, armies, and police forces\u2014 are in power because of government\ninterference with the free marketplace. Utopian socialists (by which I\nmean supporters of theoretical systems of socialism that have never yet\nbeen realized in any country) claim that in societies falsely calling\nthemselves \"socialist,\" the party leaders, economic managers, generals,\netc., have been able to consolidate their oligarchic ruling classes by\nforcefully subverting socialist institutions. In both cases it is claimed\nthat the faulty nature of the actual societies is due to interference\n\n\nwith the basically \"good\" economic systems\u2014not to the faulty natures ot\nthe systems themselves.\n\n     If bankers and industrialists can acquire overwhelming economic power,\nit seems certain that they will also largely control political life,\neven in societies with built-in countervailing powers. However, in the\nUnited States, the divisions within the economic\/political elite, the\nrelative autonomy of the three branches of government provided for by the\nUS Constitution, and the guarantees of basic rights comprised in its\namendments prevent the \"ruling class\" or any segment of it from exercising\nabsolute hegemony. Various aspects of the present systems of expression,\ngovernance, production, distribution, etc., can be criticised, exposed,\nand opposed in manifestations as diverse as anti-nuclear-power demonstra-\ntions and language art (on the \"left\") and anti-busing demonstrations and\nNazi rallies (on the \"right\"), as well as in publications expressing a very\nwide range of political and social opinions and attitudes.\n\n     I do not think this diversity of expression and action is meaningless.\nIt is a positive and desirable feature of so-called \"bourgeois democracies\"\nthat is absent from capitalist societies that have a relatively small and\nunified ruling class in full control of the state apparatus and from\n\"socialist\" societies in which both the state and the economic system are\ncontrolled by authoritarian parties claiming to rule in the name of the\nproletariat.\n\n     Such a diversity must be an essential feature of any society that I\ncan think of as desirable. I do not see how it can be a part of any\nsociety ruled by a dictatorship, even a working-class dictatorship (grant-\ning the extremely unlikely premise that a \"dictatorship\" can be exercised\nby the working class \"as a whole\"). Such features must be preserved in\nany transition toward a juster, less exploitative, less coercive, and less\nviolent society. One must move out from what is positive in the present\nsituation. There is no such thing as a perfect society, but there can be\na better one.\n\nJACKSON MAC LOW\n"},{"uid":"JacksonMacLow_LanguageCentered_1982","author":"Jackson Mac Low","shortTitle":"Language-Centered'","title":"Jackson Mac Low | Language-Centered' | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1982","date":1982,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":4.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEvol4\/pictures\/013.html","text":"\n                'Language-Centered'\n\n\n\n\n            Jackson Mac Low\n\n\n\nThe term \u2018language-centered\u2019 is ill chosen. The many works thrown under this rubric are no more\n'centered in language' than a multitude of other literary works. Many depart from normal syntax. In\nmany, what might be called 'subject matter' shifts rapidly. In some, such as many of my own,\nprinciples such as 'objective hazard,' 'indeterminacy,' and 'lessening of the dominance of the ego'\nmay predominate over more usual concerns. But that a writer's efforts are ever 'centered in language'\nis highly dubious.\n\n        That most of these works use language in unusual ways is undeniable. But in what senses are\nthey 'centered in language'? I suppose most users of such terms are impressed by lack of narration or\nexposition as these literary processes are usually conducted. Admittedly, few of these works tell a\nconnected story or support an explicit thesis. But does this mean they are 'centered in language'?\n\n        Certainly, like any other works of literature, their material cause, their means, is language, or\nelements thereof. \u2014 Their means? Aristotle would have said 'their means of imitation,' but could they\nbe said to imitate anything? \u2014 actions, movements of thought and\/or feeling, the advent of revelatory\nexperiences (Joyce's 'epiphanies'), or anything else? Can these works be seen as imitations in any sense\nof the term?\n\n        Seemingly, no. Often one word, phrase, or sentence seems to follow another with little\nregard for the recognized imports of these signs and strings. Their concatenation seems governed not\nby their referents, or by relations among them, but by features and relations intrinsic to them as\nlanguage objects. Indeed, some practitioners and sympathetic critics call such works 'nonreferential,'\nand one of them has mounted a brilliant, seemingly Marxist, attack on reference as a kind of\nfetishism contributing to alienation. But this is a dangerous argument, easily turned against its\nproponents. What could be more of a fetish or more alienated than slices of language stripped of\nreference?\n\n        Of course, as other practitioners and critics have realized and stated, no language use is really\n'nonreferential.' If it's language, it consists of signs, and all signs point to what they signify. All signs\nhave significance.\n\n        So surely the term 'nonreferential' is also ill chosen.\n\n\n* EDITORS\u2019 NOTE: In this piece Mac Low criticizes terms which we also feel tend to inhibit understanding of the work\nthey attempt to characterize. We hope this reiteration will underscore the fact that these are not our terms.\n\n\n         What I think those who've used this term have meant to point out is the lack of any obvious\n'object of imitation' or 'subject matter.' No situation, action, suffering, wave of emotion, or\nargument seems to be conveyed. (Or where some situations, actions, etc., seem to be conveyed, the\nwork as a whole doesn't seem to have any unifying subject, etc.) The attention seems centered on\nlinguistic details and the relations among them, rather than on what they might 'point to.'\n\n         But except in extreme lettristic cases, the works in question are made up of Elements \u2014\nmorphemes, words, phrases, clauses, sentences \u2014 that have at least minimal meanings \u2014 intentions.\nNouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs 'refer' either to particular objects, persons, places, etc., or to any\nmember(s) of (a) certain class(es) of objects, qualities, etc., or to attributes, properties, or\ncharacteristics of any of these. They have, as linguists put it, 'lexical meanings.'\n\n         Other types of words \u2014 prepositions, pronouns, articles, etc. \u2014 show relations existing\namong words that have lexical meanings; they are said to have \u2018structural meanings.\u2019\n\n         But can mentioning these 'referents' be sufficient to do away with the notion of\n'nonreferentiality'?\n\n         Obviously not. Those who hold this notion are fully aware of all these types of reference.\nThen perhaps the term 'nonreferential' implies that disjunct 'references' and 'intentions' do not 'add\nup': if you say 'dog watermelon Racine Wisconsin Jupiter oleaginous to quarter above the of one\nGeorge Washington Bill threw closeout ..,\u2019 each of the members of the string has meaning in itself,\nbut the string as a whole does not. The lexical items have their inevitable referents, but most of the\nstructural words do not seem to be showing relations obtaining among the lexical words, and 'worst\nof all,' the word string as a whole seems to have no referent at all.\n\n         Even when verse or prose of the types called 'language-centered' is composed of phrases,\nclauses, and\/or sentences \u2014 normally meaningful word strings \u2014 the discourse as a whole seems to\nhave no ascertainable referent \u2014 no recognizable object of imitation, subject matter, or argument.\nHow is one to deal with this situation without bringing in such notions as 'language-centeredness' or\n'nonreferentiality'?\n\n         Is there any sense in bringing in such a nonlinguistic and nonliterary term as 'the No-Mind'?\nThis term is used by Zen Buddhists to refer to the deepest 'layer' of mind, below both the conscious\nego and the psychoanalytic unconscious. It is impersonal, 'untainted' by ego. Some of us who have\nused chance operations to produce works of art have seen these works as embodying or expressing the\nNo-Mind. When such works are comprised of words and strings, the attention of the perceiver is\nindeed centered on such language elements in themselves rather than on anything the authors wish to\n'say' or 'imitate.'\n\n         I think that I was strongly convinced that this was the case when I began aleatoric verbal\ncomposition in the middle 50s. However, the idea is a complex one, and its acceptance depends upon\nthe thorough understanding and acceptance of Buddhist psychological theory. Moreover, many of\n\n\nthe authors whose works are in question might resent the introduction of an idea that they may find\nobscurantist or mystical, and it may not be necessary to bring in this idea from Zen to deal with this\nfield of literary works.\n\n         When I began aleatoric verbal composition, I thought of the works as being concrete' (I\nusually resented the application of the term 'abstract' to them): as I saw it then, the attention of the\nperceiver is directed to each word and\/or string in turn, rather than on anything outside themselves.\nLater, in the early 70s, when John Cage used chance operations to compose a long four-part poem\nmade up of language elements drawn from H.D. Thoreau's Journals, he called it Empty Words,\nimplying that these words, etc., have no 'content.'\n\n         But aside from the fact that most authors whose works are called 'language-centered' or\n\u2018nonreferential' do not use chance operations in writing them, I doubt that any such works, whether\naleatoric or consciously composed through calculation or intuition, are truly 'empty' of all content,\neven when the authors have none in mind \u2014 when they do not intend to say or imitate anything.\n\n         The very fact that these works are composed of language elements that have intrinsic\nreferences precludes their being completely empty. Even disjunct or collaged phonemes remind us of\nwords in which they may occur. Similarly, words and phrases inevitably lead the perceiver's mind to\npossible sentences in which they might be occurring, and sentences at least connote larger discourses.\n\n         The fact that there may be no such sentences in the works themselves or that when sentences\noccur they do not comprise such discourses, does not prevent the perceiver's mind from\n'semiconsciously' constructing larger wholes of which the given language elements are parts. The\nmind moves beyond the language elements themselves, impelled by a complex melange of\ndenotations and connotations and of remembered language experiences and life experiences. That\nsome perceivers are moved by some works of this kind is adequate proof of this.\n\n         Some writers of the type being discussed may consciously form their works to secure such an\neffect \u2014 some may even have an underlying subject-matter. Others may not. But in almost all cases,\nin varying degrees, the perceiver becomes the center \u2014 the meaning-finder.\n\n         Whatever the intentions of the authors, if the perceivers give serious attention to the works,\nthey will \u2014 at some 'level' \u2014 be finding meanings. This is what arouses and sustains their interest\nand sometimes moves them emotionally.\n\n         Thus it may be most correct to call such verbal works 'perceiver-centered' rather than\n'language-centered' (and certainly rather than 'nonreferential'). Whatever the degree of guidance\ngiven by the authors, all or the larger part of the work of giving or finding meaning devolves upon\nthe perceivers. The works are indeed 'perceiver-centered.'\n\n         This should come as no surprise to those of us who were led to this type of verbal work by\nstudy and experience of Zen and other types of Buddhism and\/or by the aleatoric musical works\ncomposed in the early 1950s by Cage and his friends. Nevertheless, I can only put this notion forth\n\n\ntentatively \u2014 less so, in all likelihood, than I would have done 20 years ago. I certainly did not start\nwriting this essay with this idea in mind. Yet when I review in my imagination many of the works of\nthe type I've been considering, the fact that the perceiver's mind (at all 'levels') is the meaning-\nsynthesizer seems to be (even when the author offers some cues or is working from an underlying\nsubject-matter or object of imitation) the characteristic common to nearly all of them.\n\n         However, whether the perceiver's mind (much less the No-Mind) is the object of imitation of\nsuch works is not something that I can presently decide. There is certainly a sense in which perceivers\nare perceiving their own minds at work when they sense meanings in these verbal Works. So it might\nwell be proper to call the perceiver's mind the object of imitation. But this may not be the case with\nmany of the nonaleatoric Works, so I will refrain from bringing this notion forth at all strongly.\n\n"},{"uid":"JacksonMacLow_LettertotheEditor_1979","author":"Jackson Mac Low","shortTitle":"Letter to the Editor","title":"Jackson Mac Low | Letter to the Editor | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn8\/pictures\/015.html","text":"\n\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR\n\nThis is in reaction to Ron Silliman\u2019s remarks (in L-A=N=G-U=A-G-E No. 7)\nabout \"WIN magazine & its anarcho-social-democrats\" & such expressions\nas \"outside of a beingness Qi] wch is not bourgeois (& hardly that of\nthe renegade bourgie who breaks away to reaffiliate herself w\/ the\nworkers)\" & \"To achieve even the limited goals any communist might seek\nwithin the framework of capitalist electoral politics,\" as well as his\nrecommendation of Lefebvre\u2019s Dialectical Materialism: \"(it should be\nsubtitled How to Think).\"\n\n1.  I have no idea what an \"anarcho-social-democrat\" is, tho in Silli-\nman\u2019s usage it\u2019s obviously a pejorative term. As far as I know, the\none common position held by the group that issues WIN is pacifism.

I\u2019m repeatedly amazed when I learn that excellent artists such as\nRon Silliman (most of whose work I admire\u2014tho probably, according to\nhim, for all the wrong reasons) still pursue the will-o\u2019-the-wisp of\n\"communism\" & adhere to that strange agglomeration of 19th-century\nconcepts & superstitions known as \"dialectical materialism.\" Why he\nshould think that the next \"communist\" state that gets set up somewhere\nshould be any improvement on the present group of war-mongering bureau-\ncratic oligarchies that busily exploit most people in their countries\nin the name of the supposedly high ideals of \"socialism\" & \"communism\"\n\n\nis beyond me. & I\u2019ve heard the \u2019\u2019argument\u201d before that \u2019\u2019real communism\u201d\n(or \u2019\u2019real socialism\") would be different from the present examples\u2014\nthat \"the people\" (\"the broad masses,\" as the Great Soviet Encyclopedia\nloves to put it) would effectively control the state apparatus, which\nitself would eventually \"wither away.\" Why should anyone believe such\nnonsense?\n\n3.  It probably does little good to recommend such a direct & eloquent\ncritique of \"dialectical materialism\" & allied notions as Milovan Djilas\u2019\nThe Unperfect Society (New York: Harcourt Brace World, 1969) to those\nstill enmeshed in the \"dialectical materialist\" spiderweb, but for what\nit\u2019s worth, I do.\n\n4.  Lack of belief in the various current ideological illusions need not\nimply a love for corporate capitalism. In fact, cleaning out the ideo-\nlogical cobwebs & 19th-century hand-me-downs is a necessary prerequisite\nto substantial desirable change in both the corporate-capitalist & the\nstate-capitalist (\"socialist\") countries, as well as in the so-called\n\"third world\" countries whose peoples have incautiously accepted infec-\ntion by Western ideological diseases, the worst of which is probably the\nbelief that there is or can be a \"Perfect Society.\" It\u2019s a toss-up\nwhether this notion (& the rather similar belief that there is \"One True\nReligion\") or simple greed have caused more misery.\n\n5.  Talk of \"a beingness which is not bourgeois\" & dividing people up\nbetween \"workers,\" \"bourgeois,\" & \"renegade bourgies\" is not going to\nadvance us one millimeter toward the achievement of the goals (\"limited\"\nor not\u2014preferably limited) Silliman & I both consider desirable. Only\ndogged & persistent & detailed work within the present concrete oppres-\nsive social systems may achieve such advance. To what extent the work\nof artists as such can contribute to it is, to say the least, proble-\nmatical .\n\n6.  I\u2019m sure Silliman will consider the following a banal & simple-\nminded question, but I can\u2019t resist asking him how long he thinks he\nwould be able to continue his artistic work in any \"communist\" state.\n\n7.

Yes the Zen\n  Buddhist motive for use of chance (&c) means was to be able to generate\n  series of \u2019\u2019dharmas\u201d (phenomena\/events, e.g., sounds, words, colored\n  shapes) relatively \u2019\u2019uncontaminated\u201d by the composer\u2019s \u201dego\" (taste,\n  constitutional predilections, opinions, current or chronic emotions).\n  It was such a relief to stop making artworks carry that burden of\n  \u2019\u2019expression\u201d! To let them become themselves, watch them grow & take shape\n  without one\u2019s pushing & shoving them around too much, was & is a great\n  pleasure: probably a \u2019\u2019self-indulgence\u201d (one cd care less) . But by the\n  later 50s it was plain to me that sense- & sense\/concept-events (tones,\n  words)\u2014the specific sensible instances\u2014are both intrinsically & extrin-\n  sically emotional: by which I mean simply that specific sounds &\/or words\n  (or other sensible elements) singly, combined, &\/or in series, have high\n  probabilities of arousing feelings within specific ranges in hearers &c\n\n\n  (whether in \"most,\" or merely most members of certain classes or ingroups\n  I\u2019m not prepared to say\u2014probably the wider the range the smaller the\n  ingroup) & also that each hearer has to bring an idiosyncratic range of\n  emotions (\"associations\"?) to each event, which is inextricably compounded\n  with the more \"general\" range in each person\u2019s experience.\n\n       But (paragraphs are emotional, said Stein) that may not be what you\n  mean by \"having emotion\": if that were all you meant I cd say that of\n  course I\u2019ve always been interested in the fact that sounds, words, &c. ,\n  no matter how \"randomly\" generated, arouse emotions \"willy-nilly\" (& I\n  for one never nil\u2019d \u2019em). But if your question means, Do I allow my own\n  emotions to influence my systematically generated work, I must answer\n  that they can\u2019t help doing so: my choices of means, materials, &c., can\u2019t\n  help being influenced by emotions, & I\u2019d be foolish if I thought they\n  weren\u2019t. Moreover, I realized by the later 50s that the events we single\n  out as \"experiences of emotion\" as against those we call \"sensations\"\n  occur as randomly as the sounds in a forest, & began to feel less\n  difference between generating works systematically & recording emotional\n  events (or otherwise using one\u2019s own or one\u2019s performers\u2019 emotions\n  as elements in artworks). & while continuing to do each of these things\n  relatively separately in some works, I have made many works in the 60s &\n  70s which variously combine chance & other generative systems with\n  various types of \"direct expression\"\u2014notably my Light Poems, of which I .\n  am presently writing the 55th (the 2nd to Stephanie Vevers: so far 18\n  notebook pages, about 20 lines each), some of which only \"have\" the\n  emotions attached to or arising from hearing names of kinds of light,\n  others of which use as elements emotions arising in my current life, &c.\n\n       Which brings me back to CB; \"2. What do you think of \u2019cheating\u2019\u2014\n  changing results so that the poem conforms to some non-procedurally\n  derived sense of meaning\u2014when composing basically chance-derived poems?\"\n  \/ JML: If I decide to use a certain system, I don\u2019t change the results of\n  that system (whether doing so is \"cheating\" or not I forebear to judge).\n  But I have at times composed systems that generate works conveying or\n  \"having\" meanings clearly intended by the composer. As you well know,\n  I\u2019ve composed many political poems & love poems while abiding strictly by\n  the results of such generative means as systematic chance.\n\n       I do want to touch on your 3rd question, finally: which I\u2019ll\n  summarize: These days I\u2019m greatly interested in work that tells me how it\n  is to live lives\u2014whether the artist\u2019s own life or the lives of others:\n  works as different in their ways as Phil Niblock\u2019s movies of people\n  working in Mexico, Peru, & the US & Sharon Mattlin\u2019s vivid embodiments of\n  \"epiphanies\" (to use Joyce\u2019s term) from the lives of her family, friends,\n  & acquaintances, as well as her own life: quasi-narrative poems in which\n  the poet\u2019s own attitudes & emotions about events & feelings are conveyed\n  predominantly by word choice, rhythms, selection of details of experiences\n  dealt with, often quite subtly & indirectly, rather than by her self-\n  consciously imposing herself upon her materials. You ask whether I\u2019m\n\n\n  less interested in \"procedural\" or language\/structural work as such.\n  Well, of such work, I\u2019m most interested in works having \"content,\" even\n  \"subject-matter,\" tho not always as the words are commonly used. Hannah\n  Weiner\u2019s \"Clairvoyant Journals\" convey her life experience while radically\n  transforming usual formats (verse\/prose\/&c) to do so, Bernadette Mayer\u2019s\n  work has done so for years. Also, your own work, as well as that of\n  Emmett Williams, Dick Higgins, & Ron Silliman, & the recent work of Peter\n  Seaton (to mention only those who quickly come to mind\u2014forgive me, others),\n  while not referring to experience with the same directness, seems \"to\n  have content\" even tho the \"subject-matter\" may often be shifting &\n  elusive. Interest, however, is not at all synonymous with value judge-\n  ment, & when I hear more purely language\/structure work, such as John\n  Cage\u2019s \"Empty Words\" or the works of Clark Coolidge, I'm often completely\n  enthralled, even tho I do not return again & again to the pages from\n  which they read.\n\n     Well, \"I think that\u2019s about enough,\" as the blessed Henry Cowell\nused to say when signing off his WBAI radio program, \"Music of the\nWorld\u2019s Peoples.\" ...\n\n                                     JACKSON MAC LOW NY 12\/22\/77\n\n\n"},{"uid":"JacksonMacLow_NonPoetry_1979","author":"Jackson Mac Low","shortTitle":"Non-Poetry","title":"Jackson Mac Low | Non-Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/023.html","text":"\nJACKSON MAC LOW\n\n1.

Where an image is\nsuggested, I see it inwardly. I hear the alliteration \"kind,\"\n\"cousin,\" \"color,\" with the near-alliteration \"glass.\" The rhyme in\n\"strange\" & \"arrangement.\" The alliteration of s\u2019s: \"spectacle,\"\n\"strange,\" \"single,\" \"system,\" \"spreading.\" The assonance of short i\u2019s\nthat binds the three sentences (\"system,\" \"this,\" \"difference\") as does\n\n\nthe ending of each sentence with an \"ing\" (which is reinforced by the\nshort e\u2019s in \"resembling\" & \"spreading\"). There are also the 2nd\nsentence\u2019s rhymes (\"ordinary,\" \"unordered\") & the alliterative sequence\n\"spectacle,\" \"pointing,\" \"spreading.\" The three sentences are a\nbound system of sounds.\n\n    But can I specify anything beyond the sounds? To use a phrase I\nfirst heard from Spencer Holst, it gives \"the sensation of meaning,\"\nbut can I connect the meanings of the words as readily as I find their\nsounds connected?\n\n    Beyond the obvious fact that the carafe is made of glass, I can see\nonly certain connections of meanings: \"a blind glass,\" \"a kind in glass\"\n(I didn\u2019t notice consciously the \"blind\"-\"kind\" rhyme before), & then\n\"a spectacle\" (something seen or to be seen, but also \"spectacles\" are\n\"glasses\"). Then \"nothing strange,\" \"not ordinary,\" \"not unordered,\"\n\"not resembling,\" & \"difference\" form a meaning sequence. Another\nsequence of meanings: \"blind,\" \"spectacle\" (with the intervening\n\"glass\"\u2019s causing the ambiguity of \"spectacle\" which might not have\nbeen as apparent without them), & \"color,\" that seems to carry over\nto \"arrangement,\" \"pointing,\" \"not unordered,\" \"not resembling,\" &\neven to \"spreading.\" The sequence \"kind\" (with its two meanings),\n\"cousin,\" \"nothing strange\" seems opposed to \"not ordinary,\" \"not\nresembling,\" & \"The difference is spreading.\": a meaning movement\nfrom near-sameness to greater & greater difference.\n\n    \"A single hurt color\" is the most emotional phrase, altho \"blind\nglass\" with its implied oxymoron (glass is usually transparent\u2014at\nleast we first think of transparency when we hear the word \"glass\"\u2014 &\nwhen it is made into spectacle lenses, it helps people to see better)\nis perhaps even more so. Maybe the \"single hurt color\" is the blackness\nof blindness. The whole poem suddenly seems to be about seeing!\n\n    But what of the \"carafe\" that starts it all? Why is it \"a blind\nglass\"? Ordinarily a carafe is one of the least \"blind\"\u2014that is, the\nmost transparent\u2014of glass containers. It usually contains plain\nwater.

This flow of divergent &\nconvergent elements reintroduces into our network of social machines a\nset of possible positionings in relationship to art in a social system\nthat predates the Western Industrial \"revolution\", & in some instances\npredates verbal rational forms altogether. The disappearing art(s) are\nmade up of a shifting group, nomadic in art activity, bound together by\nno dogma or theory, evidenced only by the performance event & occasion\n(which some disappearing artists contend does not end or begin, as in\nSteve McCaffery\u2019s notion of Permanent Performance). Our social indoc-\ntrination\/conditioning\/acculturation often convince us to long for\npartially or wholly predigested phenomena as the material of our per-\nception, which in part accounts for the subliminal hypnotic hysteria\nfor sameness & cloning that agents such as advertizing make possible in\nour society. Disappearing art(s) encourage a recognition & constructive\nappreciation of difference & the ability to work from an apparent chaos.\nDisappearing art(s) is not a movement, but a tool for viewing, in intui-\ntive & pragmatic manners, a wide spectrum of work: many disappearing\nartists will never hear of or meet each other: they are disappearing\ntoo fast.\n\nAn art located moving in a shift of the art\u2019s social function(s)\u2014not\nto entertain, or to take one\u2019s mind off...one\u2019s troubles, but to put\none\u2019s mind on those troubles, supportive of the impulse(s) to social\nchange: \u2014 no more escapist literature or an afternoon\u2019s aesthetic di-\nversions. Disappearing art(s) move counter to the virtuoso & the\nexpert, and counter to manipulation, coercion, sentimentality, melo-\ndrama, and mystification. The mechanisms of characterization, narrative\nand psychology falter in respect to the tension and possibility of each\nother. An art located moving may appear as a blur, which the distinc-\ntions of theater, dance, and literature cannot contain. & the dis-\nappearing art(s) disappear with no funds. Arts funding sources are\ndesigned to, at best, support ventures that fall within strict cate-\ngories.\n\nA focal impulse in the work is that made up by the social specifics\nwhere if a decision of intent or meaning is made, it is not made by the\nperformers. The disappearing act is not a performed work imposed on a\npassive audience, but a record of the interactivities between a par-\nticular artist & the larger group of audience & artist.\n\n\nThe disappearing art(s) are (dis) appearing \u2014 combining numerous forms\nof theater, dance, poetry, video, music and other media. The (dis)-\nappearing art(s) disappear in (out of) order that who was watching may\ndecide for themselves. The traditional response modes steer a shadowy\naudience, conducted through television, spectator sports, & pornography,\ntoward a system that will make their decisions for them. Vocals, mo-\ntion, music, visuals construct an event that is social before artistic,\nfor a reason that the mechanisms by which one judges\/perceives the\nevent cannot be those trained on a \u2019\u2019pure\u201d form, but are ones which ap-\npear beside the (dis)appearance (as one beside oneself).

All three are part of the Baltimore\nperformance group Co-Accident,)\n\nwrench wrench takes as a material source any words or phrases Kirby\nMalone encounters in his daily life. In the act of writing it down, a\nphrase is often foreshortened, run on into another unrelated phrase, or\notherwise deprived of its literal sense. The reader, encountering the\nphrase as part of a skew geometric pattern on a 3x5 inch file card,\ncannot ascertain whether it came from \"The Incredible Hulk,\" a wrong\nnumber phone call, The Revolution of Everyday Life, or a stoned conver-\nsation with the oil-burner repairman.\n\nThe act of writing in crowded public situations, writing anything, is a\ncuriosity. People\u2019s attentions are drawn to Kirby when he writes on\nhis cards.\n\nThe published volume wrench wrench will begin with an epigraph from a\ndescription of Pierre Jacquet-Droz\u2019s automaton The Young Writer: \"When\nthe mechanism is started, the boy dips his pen in the inkwell, shakes it\n\n\ntwice, places his hand at the top of the page, and pauses. As the lever\nis pressed again, he begins to write, slowly and carefully, distingui-\nshing in his characters between light and heavy strokes.\"\n\nOne notices in wrench wrench that every statement is a sentence, the\ncomposition is a syncopation of total starts and stops. The writing is\na quantitative act, a part of production. There is a schism between\nseparate words and the larger shapes and patterns of words. Grammar is\nimagined.\n\nWHAT DO YOU LISTEN TO WHEN YOU WRITE? The process is based on ruptures\nor breaks, sometimes intentional on my part and sometimes on how I heard\nit.\n\nBEFORE YOU STARTED WRENCH WRENCH DID YOU LISTEN TO WHAT IS AROUND YOU\nDIFFERENTLY? Everything I've written since 1975 has had something with\nfound material, starting off with literary material like Olson or Tim\nBuckley.... What is interesting is that what I do in wrench wrench is\nnot all recording. What I've come to try to understand is desire\u2014not\nhow it is interpreted in pop culture. The way I understand desire now,\nis not how it is described in Romantic terms today, or in competitive\ncapitalist terms, but as an activity which lies outside of commodity\nfetishism, outside of capitalist production.\n\n\"For Deleuze and Guatarri, as for Lacan, the forms of desire are not set\nin nature, but are socially created... In Anti-Oedipus we are presented\nwith a picture of the world whose complexity and flux defy language...\nDeleuze and Guatarri see man as constituted by \"desiring machines\".\n\nInfinite types and varieties of relationships are possible; each person\u2019s\nmachine parts can plug into and unplug from machine parts of another.\n\nThere is, in other words, no given \u2019self\u2019, only the cacophony of desiring\nmachines. Fragmentation is universal, and is not the peculiar fate of\nwhat society defines as the schizophrenic. But the crucial point is\nthat capitalist society cannot live with the infinite variety of poten-\ntial interconnections and relationships and imposes restraints regulating\nwhich ones are to be allowed, i.e., essentially those relating to\nreproduction in the family....\" (Jeffrey Weeks, introduction to Guy\nHocquenghem, Homosexual Desire.)\n\nKirby sees the writer as a \"desiring machine\". It is assumed that\nproduction is continuous, with no breaks or stoppages. But a machine\ncannot flow or move effortlessly. It can only continue by breaking\nsteps into smaller and smaller ones. Writing is a discontinuous process,\na mechanical process against the continuity of language.\n\n...What I learned to be decontextualization. Whatever it is you can't\nsay \u2014 there will be a trace of it in that fragment [of what you do say]\na fragment of whatever that had outside of ^it]\n\n\nIn performance, this process of decontextualization is reversed in an\ninteresting way. wrench wrench was performed 11 times between January\n1978 and February 1979 as part of a poetry reading or a CoAccident per-\nformance. The reading of the text was usually combined simultaneously\nwith one or more other diverse often unconnected events. Some of these\nevents were the sound of bowed cymbals and pot lids, a slide of a German\nfactory shown to each member of the audience individually with a hand\nviewer, dancers illuminating each other with flashlights, and Kirby\u2019s\nface upside down reading the text on 17 video monitors.\n\nThe title wrench wrench is rupture, like \"tool tool\", \"machine part\nmachine part machine part\".\n\nI would want [wrench wrench] to be a tool for a reader to learn more\nabout hierarchy or manipulation in language.\n\nI don't want it to be didactic at all. One one level it's a time\ncapsule of all of language being used now. I could never assemble all\nthe ways I've used language from early 1978 through 1981 [when wrench\nwrench will be completed] .\n\nIt's like a little thread through all that.\n\nBut again I don't think it's a record. It's more like an example.\n\nI'm always going out to hear it and going back into writing it. I have\na different existence in conversation because just as you are writing,\nyou lose some of what I am saying, I lose some of what I hear.\n\nCHRIS MASON & MARSHALL REESE"},{"uid":"BernadetteMayer_Experiments_1978","author":"Bernadette Mayer","shortTitle":"Experiments","title":"Bernadette Mayer | Experiments | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn3\/pictures\/001.html","text":"\n\n\n        EXPERIMENTS\n\nPick any word at random (noun is easy): let mind play freely around it\nuntil a few ideas have passed through.

Then somebody else told me an ounce a\n  year is added to your weight from all the things in the foods that stay\n  in your body so by now I must\u2019ve read three extra pounds of books I cant\n  use, at least. Sometimes I like to read a book that has information in\n  it but when I\u2019m reading a novel, for instance, I dont want to be learning\n  about, say, a foreign place. Besides poetry, prose books that arent\n  novels & also arent about any subject are the best ones. I\u2019d been think-\n  ing that at least in poetry there\u2019s no such thing as autobiography, and\n  very often not in prose either because even if you write about yourself\n  if you\u2019re really writing you are being the medium. Also the idea to have\n  to write is a willful sexual thing, never devoid of emotion unless you\n  take the will out of it & then it\u2019s a trinket or perhaps a good experi-\n  ment. Maybe syntax is even necessary to give pleasure to the movement\n  of will. Maybe simplicity & a form seem, at the moment, to be a return.\n  MY LIFE is too a daring title. MY LIFE has a kind of cunning that leads\n  in all these directions I\u2019d been thinking about when I found it & read\n  it. It\u2019s a timely book in the momentary literary sense & it also has\n  everything in it. The structure is an interweaving in a kind of rapid-\n  fire overlapping of memory with all its points & phrases that makes, you\n  could almost say a picture, that winds up having what you might call a\n  discrete uniformity if you were writing about a picture. It\u2019s knotted &\n  knitted & it\u2019s completed. It moves fast, it\u2019s full of sentences like\n  \"the dog digs dirt\" & \"not a fuck but a hug\", but it\u2019s also full of ger-\n  unds which give to emotion (& that will that makes forms able to proceed\n  humanly) as we know from Gertrude Stein. There is something almost wish-\n\n\n  fully neat about it, childlike & apt, which is like the idea of courting\n  & denying autobiography & becoming as an I-character in a book, nearly\n  perfect, which one might fault except that it is continuous & \"for we who\n  love to be astonished,\" all the childlikeness, almost out of pure informa-\n  tion, remains intact. The author is both new in her language concerns\n  & managing to say things cleanly. It\u2019s like the opposite of Proust, no,\n  it\u2019s like a sprightly Proust, a speedy Proust, no less jogging. MY LIFE\n  has so many good lines in it, it\u2019s like a trot, it makes you want to\n  steal from it or perhaps annotate it & make the compliment (or comple-\n  ment) of imitating it.\n\n                                                  BERNADETTE MAYER"},{"uid":"PeterMayer_PoeticsoftheAlphabet_1978","author":"Peter Mayer","shortTitle":"Poetics of the Alphabet","title":"Peter Mayer | Poetics of the Alphabet | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn4\/pictures\/017.html","text":"\n\n\n            POETICS OF THE ALPHABET\n\n\n   1.    The torrent of books about the ABC\u2019s hardly touches the poetics of\nscript. It is strange that though number symbolism in literature has\nmany books devoted to it, letter symbolism has not. Linguistics as\nopposed to philology has not hitherto included the study of letters.\n\n   2.    Are the linguistic sign and\/or the letterform arbitary-conventional-\nopaque-unmotivated or natural-transparent-motivated? This has been\nargued back and forth throughout the ages in most of the World\u2019s literate\ncultures. There have been geniuses ranged on both sides. The following\nhave considered the sign to be \"natural\" (or one of its quasi-synonyms):\nPlato, Aquinas, Lessing, Pope, Vico, Shelley, Claudel, Sartre, etc. The\n\n\narbitrar\u00edan\" position has been embraced by: Rabelais, Shakespeare, Berke-\nley, Butler, Marx, de Saussure, etc. Most orthodox modern linguistics is\nbased upon the sign\u2019s arbitrariness-conventionality-opacity-nonmotivation.\nBut there have been some important exceptions, e.g. Jakobson, Bolinger,\netc. Many poets and other practitioners of language arts have considered\nthat their practice would be impossible if the linguistic sign were arbi-\ntrary. Allott (1973) and Genette (1976) are invaluable for a study of\nthe \"anti-arbitrarian\" position which is the underpinning to the\nfollowing sections of this note.\n\n   3.    The sounds of letters and the meanings of either or both. Practi-\ntioners and theoreticians of poetry (the best of whom are also practi-\ntioners) have itemised the significations of various speech sounds. Those\nwho have done this fascinating work range from Dionusius of Hallicarnassus\nto Mallarm\u00e9 and Edith Sitwell, etc. There have also been numerous experi-\nments on phonetic symbolism in various languages reported in academic\npsychological and even linguistic journals. The study of similar words in\nunrelated languages and of mouth gestures has revealed much about phonetic\nsymbolism. Linguistic study of photo-aesthemes is beginning to develop.\n\n   4.    Letternames and their meaning. Most ancient ABC\u2019s have letternames\nwhich are also the names of things, e.g. in Phoenician, Hebrew, Runic,\nOld Slavonic, etc. The letter in question is usually the initial of the\nlettername. In less ancient ABC\u2019s, e.g. Roman, the letter in question\nslips into a non-initial position in the lettername: eF, eL, eM, eN, aR,\neS, eX. In some modern ABC\u2019s this reversal is avoided, e.g. in Korean,\nBulgarian, and Turkish.\n\n   5.    Scripts and scriptures^ the spirit of the letter. The following\nmake a fascinating study: creation legends of various ABC\u2019s, Greek letter\nlore, the Kabbala in the Judaic and other related faiths, Jaffr in Arabic,\nTantric letter symbolism in Sanskrit and Tibetan, Christian letter sym-\nbolism.\n\n   6.    The letter in literature as constellation\u2083 pictogram or ideogram\nhas been manifested: rarely in Chinese and other languages using Chinese\nscript (Ho Chi-minh\u2019s WORDPLAY in his PRISON DIARY, Japanese concrete\npoetry), Mallarm\u00e9 & Apollinaire in French, Fenellosa, Pound and a host of\nothers (mainly critics) in English. There have been swarms of letterform\nsimiles in English (Nabokov), French (Claudel, Robbe-Grillet), German,\nSpanish (Gomez de la Serna) and Russian (Nabokov) literatures. This mode\nis even commoner in advertising.\n\n   7.    Picture ABC's for children & others. Pictorial ABC\u2019s were part of\nancient, medieval and baroque mnemonic systems. Most of these were based\non the initial letter principle which has already broken down in Roman\ntimes. A few children\u2019s ABC\u2019s were based on similarities between the\npictured object and the letterform. A smaller number on similarities\n\n\nbetween letterforms and mouthshapes. Some artists, e.g. Klee, used letter-\nforms in their art. There has always been a dynamic interchange between\npicture and letterform.\n\n   8.     Occult letterform correspondences. There are historical and compara-\ntive correspondences between letters, the Zodiac, planets, parts of the\nhuman body, numbers, etc. Some argue that the origin of the ABC lies in\nthe Zodiac.\n\n   9.

Sexual symbolism as a source of letters (Kallir).\nModern outcrops of erotic letterform similes in Persian, Turkish, Gogol,\nRobbe-Grillet, etc.\n\n\n  12.   Lett erforms and mouthshapes. At least 30 writers including me have\nheld that the parallels between letterforms and the shape of the inside\nand\/or outside of the mouth may be part of the origin and\/or development\nof letterforms. There are neuro-physiological arguments in favor of this\nidea, non-existence of totally silent reading or for that matter listening.\nThe Korean ABC is designed according to this parallel as well as occult\ncorrepondences. (No contradiction involved between both modes or between\nthem and other explanation of Graphogenesis, e.g. Acrophony, punning,\npansexualism, etc). The ABC has multiple causality (Kallir). Possibility\nthat letter-mouth link-up applies to Greek, Devanagari, Roman, Hebrew,\netc. scripts.\n\n  13.   Graphology.

Pound\u2019s\n    vorticism also forms part of the grid of influences, and on one level at\n    least, Carnival can be seen as an attempt to abstract, concretize and\n    expand Pound\u2019s concept of the image as the circular pull of an intellectual\n    and emotional energy. Above all it is a structure of strategic counter-\n    communication designed to draw a reader inward to a locus where text\n    surrounds her. Language units are placed in visible conflict, in patterns\n    of defective messages, creating a semantic texture by shaping an inter-\n    ference within the clear line of statement....\n\n         Two phrases seemed to haunt me during the five years of composition.\n    One, that form \u2019is the only possible thing\u201d\u2014a phrase, I think, that either\n    echoes or cribs a line in Paul Blackburn\u2019s Journals. The other was Pound\u2019s\n    lines in Canto CXVI: \"to \u2019see again,\u2019 \/ the verb is \u2019see,\u2019 not \u2019walk on\u2019\"\n    \u2014 a profound phrase which I take to be Pound\u2019s ultimate stand in support\n    of static, synchronic vista (Dante) as opposed to the dynamic line of\n    processual flow. Dante climbed, in the Paradiso^ out of narrative into a\n    non-narrative summation of the story line \u2014 as if art struggles to\n    distance that which threatens it in closest proximity: language itself.\n    Carnival is product and machine, not process; though its creation be a\n    calenture to me, it must stand objective as a distancing and isolating of\n    the language experience. The thrust is geomantic \u2014 a realignment of\n    speech, like earth, for purposes of intelligible access to its neglected\n    qualities of immanence and non-reference. It is language presented as\n    direct physical impact, constructed as a peak, at first to stand on and\n    look down from the privilege of its distance onto language as something\n    separate from you. Taken this way \u2014 as the \u2019seen thing\u2019 \u2014 its conflicts\n    and contradictions are accommodated in a form based more on the free\n    flight of its particulars than on a rigid component control. But Carnival\n    is also a peak to descend from into language. The panel when \u2019seen\u2019 is\n    \u2019all language at a distance\u2019; the panel when read is entered, and offers\n    the reader the experience of non-narrative language. There\u2019s no clues to\n    passage for the reader other than the one phrase of Kung\u2019s: \u2019make it new\u2019,\n    move freely, as the language itself moves, along one and more of the\n\n\n    countless reading paths available, through zones of familiar sense into\n    the opaque regions of the unintelligible, and then out again to savour\n    the collision of the language groupings. Against the melodic line which\n    is narrative I work with semantic patchwork, blocks of truncated sense\n    that overlap, converge, collide without transition as the sum total of\n    language games within our many universes of discourse....\n\n        My own personal line of continuity goes back from Carnival to Pope\u2019s\n   Dvnciad: \"Thy hand great Dulness! lets the curtain fall, \/ And universal\n   Darkness covers all.\" \u2014 in which Pope speaks as the Augustan panelogist\n   par excellence alarmed at the collapse of all linguistic strata.\n\n        Interestingly enough, Alexander Pope and the typewriter were contem-\n   poraries. Henri Mill invented the typewriter in 1714, the year the enlarged\n   version of The Rape of the Lock appeared and a year before Pope\u2019s transla-\n   tion of The Iliad. The roots of the typewriter are Augustan; its repetitive\n   principle is the principle of the couplet enhanced by speed. The typewriter\n   oracled a neoclassical futurism that emerged in the mid twentieth century\n   as poesie concrete. This is part of that oracle.\n\n\n\n"},{"uid":"SteveMcCaffery_FromtheNotebooks_1979","author":"Steve McCaffery","shortTitle":"From the Notebooks","title":"Steve McCaffery | From the Notebooks | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/031.html","text":"\nSTEVE MC CAFFERY :\n\n\nFROM THE NOTEBOOKS\n\nThe fight for language is a political fight. The fight for language is\nalso a fight inside language.\n\nGrammar is a huge conciliatory machine assimilating elements into a ready\nstructure. This grammatical structure can be likened to profit in capital-\nism, which is reinvested to absorb more human labour for further profit.\nClassical narrative structure is a profit structure.\n\nGrammar, as repressive mechanism, regulates the free circulation of meaning\n(the repression of polysemeity into monosemeity and guided towards a\nsense of meaning as accumulated, as surplus value of signification).\n\n\nThe importance of a language centered writing\u2014all writing of\ndiminished referentiality\u2014is the writing and reading per se, as produc-\ntional values (the writing as a production of production; the reading a\nproduction of the text). Both writing and reading of these texts are\naspects of a language production. What publishing achieves is an extension\nof circulation on the basis of exchangeability. The act of publishing\nalways runs the risk of producing an occultation of a use value by an ex-\nchange value.\n\nGrammatically centered meaning is meaning realized through a specific mode\nof temporalization. It is understood as a postponed \u2019\u2019reward\u201d at the end\n(the culmination) of a series of syntagms. It is that fetish in which the\nsentence completes itself. Meaning is like capital in so far as it extends\nits law of value to new objects. Like surplus value, meaning is frequently\n\u2019\u2019achieved\u201d to be reinvested in the extending chain of significations. This\nis seen quite clearly in classical narrative, where meaning operates as\naccumulated and accumulative units in the furtherance of \u2019\u2019plot\" or \"char-\nacter development\": those elements of representation which lead to a des-\ntination outside of the domain of the signifier.\n\nMeaning is the unconscious political element in lineal grammaticization.\nWords (with their restricted and precisely determined profit margin) are\ninvested into the sentence, which in turn is invested in further sentences.\nHence, the paragraph emerges as a stage in capital accumulation within the\npolitical economy of the linguistic sign. The paragraph is the product of\ninvestment, its surplus value (meaning) being carried into some larger\nunit: the chapter, the book, the collected works.\n\nGrammar is invested precisely because of the expected profit rate viz. a\nclarity through sequence carried into meaning.\n\nA grammatical critique can be mobilized by presenting language as opaque\nand resistent to reinvestment. A language centered writing, for instance,\nand zero-semantic sound poetry, diminishes the profit rate and lowers\ninvestment drives just as a productive need is increased. Meaning in these\ncases is no longer a surplus value, but that which is to be produced with-\nout reinvestment. This need to produce (brought on by instituting an\nopacity in language) becomes the need to activate a relation of human\nenergies.\n\nReference, like Capitalism, is \"metamorphosis without an intrinsic code\"\n(Lyotard). There is no code beyond referent reality, for referents are\nthe destination points of codes. Reference, its placement both in and out-\nside the triangularity of the sign, territorializes the flows of code as a\nconstant movement into absence in destinations outside of itself. Writing\ncan be modeled on energumen (on a semiotics of circulation and flow) and\nso work towards the redistribution of flow and a complication within the\nvectors of reference.\n\n\nA language-centered writing not only codes its own flow but also encodes\nits own codicities. It is not, however, a code of representation but a\nregulatory code of the intrinsic, differential and oppositive flows of\nwords. The Capitalist rationale is : you can produce and consume every-\nthing and everywhere providing it flows and providing it\u2019s exchangeable.\nReference marks a point of extreme liquidity in the Sign. It is, in fact,\nthe line along which the Signifier liquidates itself, exchanges itself for\nthe Other by means of the flow occurring along the surface of a grammatical\nmeaning. Reference is indifferent to either Sign or Referent. Reference\nis the flow, the liquid progression of a liquidity itself already marked\nto be undifferentiated absence. Reference needs no code because it is the\nend of codicity. It is the destination of code per se and its sole tele-\nology is the institution of flow (alterity) territorialized into a vector\nout of a presence (the graphic forms on the page) into an absence (= that\nwhich can never be inside of language.)\n\nMeaning finds its place in bourgeois epistemological economy as a consumed\nsurplus value; the extract from textual signification, found wholly as a\nsurplus value at the end of a reading (whether sentence, paragraph or\nentire text.) Meaning in classical discourse is NOT a productive\/produc-\ntional use value: that which a reader herself produces from a human engage-\nment with text.\n\nThe consumption of text occurs historically at that point where the reader\nherself is consumed and dehumanized by the text. Signs are consumed when\nreaders are alienated from signification. Text, as a human issue, as the\nconjoint concern of reader and writer, with a destination in recycling a\nprocess rather than in a reified semantic object might eliminate meaning\nas that which meets one\u2019s gaze, fixed, in isolated distance.\n\nCapitalism\u2014a decoded equality where all is equalized into exchangeability\ncommodity promotion, loss of self, human serialization. And the reproduc-\ntive organ of Capitalism is metamorphosis.\n\nOne thing a language centered writing desires is a presentness that lan-\nguage primarily focussed on reference can\u2019t provide. This is not so much\na presentness of language per se (whose signifying functions as represent-\nation is predicated on a certain absence (of the term stood for)) as the\nreader\u2019s presentness to language itself. A presentness promoted by dimin-\nished consumption. In language centered writing referential reality re-\ncedes in order that the quality of the Sign as signifier, as imprint or\nmark, might be experienced as a \u2019\u2019presentness before\u201d. As language center-\ned readers we do not consume signs so much as confront them as opacities\nor produce them from ciphers. A language centered writing dispossesses us\nof language in order that we may repossess it again. A productive atti-\ntude to text takes the form of a writerly stance on the reader\u2019s part and\nis the first step towards a humanization of the Sign.\n\n"},{"uid":"SteveMcCaffery_MichaelPalmerALanguageofLanguage_1978","author":"Steve McCaffery","shortTitle":"Michael Palmer: A Language of Language","title":"Steve McCaffery | Michael Palmer: A Language of Language | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn5\/pictures\/019.html","text":"\n\n\n\nMICHAEL PALMER: A LANGUAGE OF LANGUAGE\n\n     Michael Palmer writes a splendid poetry of displacement, of shifts\nand nomadic drifts of text through zones of page. The operative semantic\n\n\nis copulative, a linking (purely syntagmatically) of isolated units still\npreserving their molecular independency. He writes a double assault:\non page per se and on the vector of reference. There is no place in his\nwork because there largely is no referent incanted. Reference is rendered\nintransitive and instigates the arbitrary flow of linguistic signs.\nReferrals without the finality of reference, ectoskeletal structures\ncarrying,deliberately interior deformations. Frequently logic is placed\nin contest with a syntax resulting in the gravity of utterance being with-\nheld. Sentences register as syntagms, surface activities of syntax, no\nentity-terminals but simply the betweenness of a trace, word motions\nrather than conveyed ideations. Logical relation is violently displaced\nby verbal relation and spacing, so that space becomes the abyss causality\nfalls into. And this space in Palmer is less projective (a breath with-\nheld) than the violated function of the sign: the articulation of dis-\nplacement. Space becomes the agonistic surface, the zone where words\ndisplace themselves. Palmer\u2019s consummate craft is the superb orchestra-\ntion of these displacements: to activate fissures, architecturally tensi-\nfied, and phrases that remain stiff in a precision of placement as all\nmeaning slides. Viewed temporally this all amounts to a consecutivity\nminus a consequentiality. In Palmer\u2019s poems there is, deliberately, no\npurpose. This leads to local composition, an investigation of grammato-\nlogical space per se, of space as deferral, of placement and occurrence\nas difference. Constant, consecutive invention on the plane of the\nsignifier.\n\n     The process of reading becomes a muscular activity of the mind\noperating in tension through disjunctions, aborted vectors, non-purposive\ncontexts. Everything happens on the level of the signifier; semic dis-\ncharge across a surface and the surface is that discharge. Page\/space\nan utterly non-hermetic experience. Meanings localized within the isolate\nsign. Contexts displace to indicate, if anything, the schizophrenic\npredications of language. (Language as a branch plant of schizophrenic\nemission?) To place us in the movements of a language of schizzes is\nIpseity. Dis \/ place \/ meant. Page for Palmer is the topography of the\ndisjunctive, supporting the integral violence of transformationality.\nFor the steady, consecutive plod of language, line after line, is at the\nsame time its violent transformation. Such a paradox describes the\nhorizontal identity of Palmer\u2019s signifier: a violent stability of grapheme\nbeing at the same time a violent instability in any molar aggregate of\n\u2019\u2019thought.\u201d The thing it is. Writing. Written. Not that linearity dis-\nappears, on the contrary, Palmer strengthens line but only in order for\nit to confess more effectively its own duplicities. The worded line\nidentifies the syntagm as a horizontal, moving segment in space possessed\nof the infinite capacity to absorb all breaks in causality and consequen-\ntiality within its consecutive motions. And thus the transparent guilt\nof reading. The guilt at witnessing a graphed pattern of place support a\n\n\nhuge displacement.\n\n     Palmer\u2019s most radical displacement is the break with transitivity\nitself. For language has become the subject of Language and we enter, as\nreaders, the ambiguous zone of texts without absolute speakers. Palmer\nmakes speech subordinate to writing; the speaking subject being the\nintractible voice dispaced as an echo in the fissures of the spacing.\nBeyond voice and presence is syntactic space and absence \u2014 the consummate\nPalmerian domain where the phonocentric becomes marginated and writing\ncomes closest to a pure Writing. Inscribed throughout his work, as its\nsyntax motion, is the locale of the subject\u2019s disappearance. Nomadic\ntopographies beyond the symmetries of line where language inscribes a\nsphere around itself and instigates a self-reflexiveness, the interroga-\ntion of the text\u2019s own limits. To write a voiceless writing is to rein-\nvent speech as an order free of voice. Palmer, I believe, is transforming\nspeech from a form and a vehicle into a content on the way to its rein-\nvention. What he presents is speech without the social activity of\nspeaking. Can this be anything else but writing?\n\n     Systematic detachment from the \u2019I\u2019 until there is no speaking subject.\nA subject alone is reading this and the words are voiceless speech in\nnon-discursive space.

Calgary, Canada\nT2N IV 8. In a related discussion, Ron Silliman brings out the relation\nof Marx's notion of commodity fetishism to conventional descriptive and\nnarrative forms of writing: where the word\u2014words\u2014cease to be valued for\nwhat they are themselves but only for their properties as instrumentalities\nleading us to a world outside or beyond them, so that the words\u2014language\u2014\ndisappear, become transparent, leaving us with the picture of a physical\nworld that the reader can then consume as a commodity. (\"Disappearance\nof the Word\/Appearance of the World,\" 1977, One Hundred Posters issue;\n\n$1.15 from L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E distributing service). Such a view of the\nrole and historical functions of writing relates closely to our analysis\nof the capitalist social order as a whole. It is our sense that the\nproject of poetry does not involve turning language into a commodity for\nconsumption; instead, it involves repossessing the sign through active\nparticipation in its production.)\n\n     Marx\u2019s notion of commodity fetishism, which is to say the occultation\nof the human relations embedded in the labour process has been central to\nmy own considerations of reference in language - of, in fact, a referen-\ntially based language, in general - and to certain \u2019\u2019fetishistic\u201d notions\nwithin the relationship of audience and performer. Reference in language\nis a strategy of promise and postponement; it\u2019s the thing that language\nnever is, never can be, but to which language is always moving. This\nlinguistic promise that the signified gives of something beyond language\ni\u2019ve come to feel as being central to capitalism (the fetish of the\ncommodity) and derived from an earlier theologicolinguistic confidence\ntrick of \u2019\u2019the other life\u201d. It\u2019s this sense of absence as a postponed\n\n\npresence which seems to be the core of narrative (the paradigm art form\nof the capitalist system) and basic to the word as we use the word in any\nrepresentational context. To demystify this fetish and reveal the human\nrelationships involved within the labour process of language will involve\nthe humanization of the linguistic Sign by means of a centering of\nlanguage within itself; a structural reappraisal of the functional roles\nof author and reader, performer and performance; the general diminishment\nof reference in communication and the promotion of forms based upon object-\npresence: the pleasure of the graphic or phonic imprint, for instance,\ntheir value as sheer linguistic stimuli. Kicking out reference from the\nword (and from performance) is to kick its most treasured and defended\ncontradiction: the logic of passage.\n\nSTEVE MCCAFFERY\n\n\n"},{"uid":"SteveMcCaffery_SoundPoetry_1979","author":"Steve McCaffery","shortTitle":"Sound Poetry","title":"Steve McCaffery | Sound Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/001.html","text":"\n            SOUND POETRY\n\n\nWhen considering text-sound it is energy, not semantically shaped\nmeaning, that constitutes the essence of communicated data. The classi-\ncal, Aristotelian conception of form is that of goal, the target-desti-\nnation at which we arrive as at a postponed reward by way of a composi-\ntion. It was, hence, to be a highly significant reversal of Aristotle\nwhen Wilhelm Reich was to declare form to be frozen energy, opening a\npath to a new conception of form as the aggregate of departures not\narrivals, the notion of the de-form as a thawing of the constrict, a\nstrategy of release, of flow.\n\n    What the sound poet practises is the deformation of linguistic form\nat the level of the signifier. For it is the scripted signifier, the\nphonematic unit that marks the crypt of a vast repression, where energy\nis frozen in the articulated and subordinated elements of representation.\nLanguage, through its nature as representation, its functioning by means\nof arbitrary, articulated signs, by means of rules, conditions and\nprohibitions, becomes a huge mechanism for suppressing libinal flow. To\ninvestigate sound in isolation from the sign-function, and to practice\nout of the actuality and non-representation of the phonematic marks an\nimportant stage in establishing the agencies for a general libidinal de-\nrepression. Sound poetry is much more than simply returning language to\nits own matter; it is an agency for desire production, for releasing\nenergy flow, for securing the passage of libido in a multiplicity of\nflows out of the Logos. To experience such flows (as a break-through in\na break-down) is to experience the sonic moment in its full intensity of\ntransience.\n\n    To align, realign and misalign within the anarchy of language. To\ncultivate excess, return language to its somatic base in order to deter-\nritorialize the sign. Concentration on molecular flows rather than the\nmolar aggregates. Cuttings. Fissures. Decompositions (inventions).\nNot intention so much as intensions. Plasticizations. Non-functional-\nities. Shattered sphericities. Marginalities. Somas. Nexi. La poeme\n\n\nc\u2019est moi but as the inscription of the person in a transcendental pro-\nnoun that utterly annihilates the subject. Personal collapse into flux.\nDilations. Positive disintegrations. Structures abandoned, departed\nfrom or de-constructed and modified into flows in accord with the unique,\nunpredictable molecular relationships of audiences and performers.\nGenetic codicities. A gift back to the body of those energy zones\nrepressed, and channelled as charter in the overcoded structure of\ngrammar. To release by a de-inscription those trapped forces of libido.\n\n     Julia Kristeva has written of literary practice as being \u2019the explor-\nation and discovery of the possibilities of language as an activity which\nfrees man from given linguistic networks\u2019. Sound poetry is best described\nas what sound poets do (or as I once answered \"it\u2019s a new way to blow out\ncandles\"); it thus takes its place in the larger struggle against all\nforms of preconditioning.\n\n     The 1950s saw the development of what might be termed a third phase\nin sound poetry. Prior to this time, in a period roughly stretching\nfrom 1875 to 1928, sound poetry\u2019s second phase had manifested itself in\nseveral diverse and revolutionary investigations into language\u2019s non-\nsemantic, acoustic properties. In the work of the Russian futurists\nKhlebnikov and Kruchenykh, the intermedia activities of Kandinsky, the\nbruitist poems of the Dadaists (Ball, Schwitters, Arp, Hausmann, Tzara)\nand the \u2019paroles in liberta\u2019 of the Italian Futurist Marinetti, the\nphonematic aspect of language became finally isolated and explored for\nits own sake. Prior to this there had been isolated pioneering attempts\nby several writers including Christian Morgenstern (ca. 1875), Lewis\nCarroll (\u2019Jabberwocky\u2019), August Stramm (ca. 1912), Petrus Borel (ca.\n1820), Moliere, the Silesian mystic Quirinus Khulman (17th century),\nRabelais and Aristophanes.\n\n     The second phase is convincing proof of the continuous presence of a\nsound poetry throughout the history of western literature. The first\nphase, perhaps better termed, the first area of sound poetry, is the\nvast, intractible area of archaic and primitive poetries, the many\ninstances of chant structures and incantation, of nonsense syllabic\nmouthings and deliberate lexical distortions still alive among North\nAmerican, African, Asian and Oceanic peoples.\n\n     We should also bear in mind the strong and persistent folkloric and\nludic strata that manifests in the world\u2019s many language games, in the\nnonsense syllabery of nursery rhymes, mnemonic counting aids, whisper\ngames and skipping chants, mouthmusic and folk-song refrain, which fore-\ngrounds us as an important compositional element in work as chronologi-\ncally separate as Kruchenykh\u2019s zaum poems (ca\u00ab 1910) and Bengt af Klints\nburg\u2019s use of cusha-calls and incantations (ca. 1965).\n\n     Sound poetry prior to the developments of the 1950s is still largely\na word bound thing. For whilst the work of the Dadaists, Futurists and\nLettrists served to free the word from its semantic function, redistri-\n\n\nbuting energy from theme and \u2019message\u2019 to matter and contour, it never-\ntheless persisted in a morphological patterning that still suggested the\npresence of the word. It is Francois Dufrene\u2019s especial achievement to\nhave pushed the limits centripetally and to have entered into the micro-\nparticulars of morphology, investigating the full expressive range of\npredenotative forms: grunts, howls, shrieks, etc, Important too, in\nthis light, is the way meaning persists as a teleology even in zaum.\nKhlebnikov, for instance, speaks of new meanings achieved through by-\npassing older forms of meaning, of meanings \u2019rescued\u2019 by \u2019estrangement\u2019.\n\n    So word persists even in the state of its own excommunication. It\ncould be said that what sound poetry did, up to the exploitation of the\ntape recorder, was to render semantic meaning transcendental, as the\ndestination arrived at by the disautomatization of sound perception. It\nis this theological contamination, of the meaning, like God, as a hidden\npresence, that specifies the limits of sound investigation up until the\nnineteen fifties.\n\n    With the fifties, however, came the gift of an external revolution:\nthe availability of the tape recorder to sound poets made audio-\ntechnological advancement of the art form a reality. To summarize the\nseveral revolutionary capabilities that tape allowed: the transcendence\nof the limits of the human body. The tape machine, considered as an\nextension of human vocality allowed the poet to move beyond his own\nexpressivity. The body is no longer the ultimate parameter, and voice\nbecomes a point of departure rather than the point of arrival. Realizing\nalso that the tape recorder provides the possibility of a secondary\norality predicated upon a graphism (tape, in fact, is but another system\nof writing where writing is described as any semiotic system of storage)\nthen we can appreciate other immediate advantages: tape liberates\ncomposition from the athletic sequentiality of the human body, pieces\nmay be edited, cutting, in effect, becomes the potential compositional\nbasis in which time segments can be arranged and rearranged outside of\nreal time performance. The tape recorder also shares the micro\/macro\/\nphonic qualities allowing a more detailed appreciation of the human vocal\nrange. Technological time can be superadded to authentic body time to\nachieve either an accelerated or decelerated experience of voice time.\nBoth time and space are harnessed to become less the controlling and more\nthe manipulable factors of audiophony. There exists then through re-\ncourse to the tape recorder as an active compositional tool, the possi-\nbility of \u2019overtaking\u2019 speech by the machine. Sound poetry mobilizes a\ncertain technicism to further the deconstruction of the word; it permits,\nthrough deceleration, the granular structure of language to emerge and\nevidence itself. Phonetic poetry, the non-semantic poetry of the human\nvoice, is more limited in its deconstructional scope, for it accepts the\nphysical limitations of the human speaker as its own limitations. The\ntape recorder, however, allows speech\u2014for the first time in its\n\n\nhistory\u2014a separation from voice.\n\n\n(The preceding is an excerpt from Steve McCaffery \u2019s essays in Sound\nPoetry: A Catalogue, edited by McCaffery and B.P.

Theirs, is not a movement as\nsuch but a quiet assertion of an interconnectedness of concerns: to\ncentre language inside itself; to show the essential subjectless-ness a\ntext might be; to stress the disemotional and dereferential possibilities\nof language as fragmentary, yet intensely direct experience. Language\nthen, for itself, but for the sake of us. To step outside of use. To\ncounter-communicate in order ... to see what a hammer is when not in\nfunction.\n\nContext is not important but historic frame articulation must\ninclude: the Russian Formalists (long neglected but appearing as\ninfluence for almost the first time in North American writing in the\nwork of Silliman and Melnick); Roland Barthes (writing degree zero,\nsemiocriticism); the works of Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida (the\nsign as diacritical ... reference ... difference ... the metaphysics of\nabsence). Earlier connections can be seen with the semi \u00a9logical writ-\nings of C.S. Peirce and the pioneer work of Ferdinand de Saussure (the\nbipolarity of the sign, the essential oppositional nature of linguistic\nunits). A parallel, too, might be drawn with the semiotic concerns of\nconcrete poetry \u2014 not so much around the investigative extrapolation\n\nof the visual properties of the word, but rather around the mutual\nstress upon language as a direct event, a \u2018seen\u2019 thing (in concretism)\nand hence a \u2018felt\u2019 thing (in language-centred writing).\n\nThe hardest thing in reading is just to see the seeing that you\u2019re\nseeing. To let the word receive your sight. To not deflect off language\nbut re-flect within it. To let your seeing be what your reading was. To\nlet the direct, empirical experience of a grapheme replace what the\nsignifier in a word will always try to discharge: its signified and refe-\nrent.\n\nLittle commentary has, so far, been forthcomng on this type of\ncounter-communication. Silliman\u2019s Surprised by Sign, which annotates\na collection of this work in Alcheringa (New Series, v. I, No. 2, 1975) is,\npossibly, the best of current access to this writing variously termed\n\u2018formalist\u2019, \u2018structuralist\u2019, \u2018dereferentialist\u2019, \u2018minimalist\u2019, \u2018language cen-\ntred\u2019 and which I will refer to as \u2018counter-communicative\u2019 and\n\u2018cipheral\u2019.\n\nProposition: to treat this work from a presupposed position of\n\u2018unreadability\u2019, \u2018disinteredness\u2019 and \u2018inaccessibility\u2019, from such con-\nsumptive stances as refuse to see text as an agent of production.\n\nLanguage-centered writing involves a major alteration in textual\nroles: of the socially defined functions of writer and rea'der as the\nproductive and consumptive poles respectively of a commodital axis.\nThe main thrust of this work is hence political, rather than aesthetic,\ntowards a frontal assault on the steady categories of authorship and\nreadership. What it offers is the alternative sense of reader and writer as\nequal and simultaneous participants within a language product. At its\ncore, linguistic reference is a displacement of human relationships and\nas such is fetishistic in the Marxian sense. Reference, like commodity,\nhas no connection with the physical property and material relations of\nthe word as a grapheme.\n\nstint grits darts\tfile\ngratis\tways to fit tins\ndapper\tangle\nill\tapple\nsax\twash\nmax\ta phone\nport planter\t\ngraph ending the end\t\nonly back a bit from passing after wrecked\t\n\nguff\n\nwater\n\nwaterized\n\nneedle\t(Barbara Baracks)\n\nThe initial problem in readership here is to abandon all prejudical\nperceptual sets and to consciously assist oneself in producing one\u2019s\nown reading among the polysemous routes that the text offers. With\nthe removal of grammatical conditioners as dictates of a single\nreading, language enters the domain of its own inwardness; the con-\nventional centrifugality of signification is reversed and the Sign turns\ninward through the absence of grammar to a pure, lexemic presence.\n\nSeen as such, then, the text is a critique of language achieved by way\nof a deconstruction of grammatical context. Words are placed next to\nwords but what the juxtaposition is deprived of is a true sense of\nwords in community. We are among isolated meanings, absolute\npotencies and graphic events.\n\nI would here deny the need to stress all this as somehow a part of\nliterature. More significant and to the point is to acknowledge a\nnumber of texts that constitute, collectively and cumulatively, a novel\ninterrogative stance of language against itself.\n\nLanguage centred writing shows a concern with the order of effects\nthat connect with the signifier rather than the referent. Together with\nthis is a specific minimization of the effect of the signified (if we\nconsider the latter to be a kind of\u2018discharge\u2019 from the signifier.) Lan-\nguage centering avoids the discharge and hence short-circuits the\nsemiotic loop. It is this superfluity of the signifier that promotes in\nthese texts the quality I term \u2018cipher\u2019.\n\nal (t\tch\n\nph ysto\tkl\n\nee\n\napl\n\nsta\n\nry (mccaffery)\n\nCipherality belongs to a synchronic poetics; it is tenseless and free\nfrom both reference and alternity, thereby centered within its textual\nself and available as a primary empirical experience. The cipheral text\ninvolves a replacement in readerly function from a reading of words to\nan experiencing of graphemes, for conventional reading involves the\nuse of referential vectors and it is such vectors that are here removed.\nLanguage is material and primary and what\u2019s experienced is the ten-\n\nsion and relationship of letters and lettristic clusters, simultaneously\nstruggling towards, yet refusing to become, significations.\n\nThe cipher or emptied sign is a frozen dialectic within a semiotic\nprocess, less an active sign than a sign removed from function (and\nhence deconstructed) to be observed and experienced as event per se.\n\nCiphericity is a zero-methodology by which texts are constructed\nwhich are designed to say nothing. To be silent, however, is to wit-\nhhold the possibility to speak. The cipheral, or language-centred text\nis, on the graphemic level of the sign, what tautology is in the formal\nrules and structures of logic. \u2018... not a field in which we express what\nwe wish with the help of signs, but rather one in which the nature of\nthe absolutely necessary signs speaks for itself.\u2019 (Wittgenstein)\n\n... The publicly silent sign, then, as the self-speaking sign. ... and\ncipher ... the tautology of the signifies\n\nmob cuspid\n\nwelch\n\nevelet\n\ngo lavender\n\nfuturibles (andrews)\n\npresents a semiotic ambivalence to the reading experience: do you\ndecipher or do you augment and complete? Both approaches are\nadmissible, for it\u2019s precisely the nature of texts like andrews\u2019 to present\nthemselves as ambiguities, approachable either as densities, as com-\npressions requiring a reading that approximates a hermeneusis; or else\nas lacunaire, deliberate incompletions requesting a reading that\nextends them towards completion.\n\nIn the first approach (i.e. treating the poem as a structural density)\nthe reading experience can be likened to a vertical axis descending\ndownwards into a text whose surface signifies an implicit depth. In\nthis manner the structure of the sign is destroyed within the poem yet,\nat the same time, is transferred into the reading experience itself where\ntext equals signifer and the reading descent equals the signified. Sign,\nin this way, expands to include readership into its very structure. In the\nsecond method of reading, we adopt a sense of meaning based upon\nthe cipher \u2014 the emptied sign. In this method, meaning is not hidden\nbeneath a surface but is emptied out of a container; the tendency to\nvertical descent through a text\u2019s illusionary surface, becomes resolved\nwithin an experiencing of absences as gaps upon a textual surface. In\nthis way syntax homologizes what in the world of sculpture is nega-\ntive space. Absence is experienced as an event either anterior or\nexterior to any semantic presence.\n\nalbe\n\nskep\n\ntref\n\njush\nnumb\n\npffe neig (Andrews)\n\nBy eliminating reference this way, by reducing the connotative range\nof the graphemes, Andrews promotes a strong object quality in this\ntext. Lettristic clusters of this kind tend to function in the manner of a\npunctuation, as pure space-time arrestments. To experience a text as\nsuch \u2018events\u2019 affirms encipherment, for a non-referential event is the\nprime quality of the emptied sign.\n\nAn alternative reading might tend to promote decipherment: the\nsign grasped as a \u2018fragmentary\u2019 base on which to develop a lexical\nreconstitution. Reading, in this manner, takes the form of a re-\ncomposition with the centrifugal pressure that all referential texts\npossess being modified as an urge back to the word. Reading here,\nthen, as a reparation of the word. The writer as logoclast. The reader as\nlogotect and logotherapist.\n\nThe implication behind a decipheral style of reading is that the given\ntext is partial, incomplete or imperfect, suggesting in these terms not\nnecessarily an aesthetic deficiency but rather a radically political invita-\ntion to the reader to cast off his former pre-ordained role as the reci-\npient of a message and to enter the domain of the writer.\n\nTwo procedural readings of language-centered writing have been\nproposed: encipherment and decipherment. Encipherment I\u2019ve tried\nto indicate above is based upon a sense of the text as complete, eventist,\nsurface and immediate; decipherment upon a sense of the text as\npotential but partial, and holding the capability to expand towards a\ndestination within semantic normality.\n\nQuite clearly from this, a decipheral reading homologizes the refe-\nrential thrust of the conventional verbal sign for both reference and\nverbal re-composition involve the use of vectors that lead to a destina-\ntion outside of the graphic, phenomenal immediacy of the physical\ntext presented.\n\ntime ceal hum base\n\ntreat south admit\n\nlaw the dissolve add\n\nowl (Coolidge)\n\nCoolidge. Andrews. Silliman. Di Palma. In their work we approach \u2014\n\nanterior to an actual reading \u2014 a page which holds coherently an\niconicity which the very act of reading removes. In reading such\npoems we thrust the text back into the domain of a writing. As in the\nabove example a statement is made in visual terms around the notion\nof cluster and detachment. To penetrate beyond the very seeing of this\nstatement, in effect, destroys that very element of the poem; it\nsuggests, in fact, that it is the experience of reading itself that promotes\nthe counter-communication. What language-centered writing serves\nto emphasize is the semiocritical relationship of consecutive to simul-\ntaneous sign, the striated nature of a reading and a seeing, and the\nrelationship of a spatial to a linear syntax.\n\nHence there\u2019s a translative act involved in the reading, from a spatial\nto a linear setting, from an instantaneous seeing of a group of lexical\nextensions (and in other cases lexical fragmentations) to a consecutive\nreading of that seeing. \u2018Reading\u2019 it might be said, is the receptor term\nin a translative process whose source term is \u2018seeing\u2019, whilst what the\npoem itself constitutes is a metaperceptual system that offers to the\nreader an initial seeing, passing on into a secondary seeing (as a\nreading) of that primary seeing.\n\nsadd bier\n\nmetapoif\nlid cift ure,\n\nhid tyer (David Melnick from: pcoet)\n\nanalog: phoneme is to tone what\nword is to melody:\nthemselves.\n\nthe text like music: for both involve a semiotics minus a compound\nsemantic level (i.e. the referential, contentual plane.)\n\nIn Melnick\u2019s work we find the most extreme, uncompromising\nexcommunication of reference. Poem as object-process not com-\nmodity and an atonality for the ear through fragmentation \u2014 here\nabove, with the word as tone; the phoneme and phoneme clusters\natonalities.\n\nApplying the notion of cipher to the unread text, text becomes the\nperceived iconicity that exists anterior to a reading. Text as icon is the\nempty sign awaiting the experience of a filling. The act of decipher-\nment is that particular kind of readerly engagement which activates\nthe kinetic properties of the text: (syntax as processual movement,\nsequentiality, reference as a psycholinguistic refraction without alter-\n\nnity however, association, connotation as the dynamic expansion of a\nmeaning important for its felt expansiveness. And what such\ndecipherment constitutes is not so much a reading as an alternative or\nadditional writing of the text. We may say that the realization of a\ndecipherment indicates a specific movement of the text, a turning back\n, of itself upon itself to formulate a centering, proposing a new reading\nas a new writing.\n\nI take it that reference, the mystifying carrot dangled before the eyes\nof the reader, is the sole preventative to such a co-participation. the\nstructural support of both literacy and capitalist economy is reference.\nThe cipher acts as a critique of language by way of a de-construction,\ndemystification and expressed truncation of the verbal Sign\u2019s serial\nreference; moving language into the domain of its autonomous parts\nseized as entities and expressed directly as the isolated actions of a\nsurface.\n\nLanguage-centered counter-communication concentrates upon fac-\ntors of formation inside of language and not on the centrifugal func-\ntioning of words; it is hence counter narrational and counter-\ncommodital at the same time. Seen through a Marxian perceptual set,\nthe cipher is a strategic method of creating non-commodital process-\nproducts, a method of ontological deconstruction that casts reader and\nwriter both into the one, same labour process. We might speak of this\nkind of writing as a bracketed poetics, deliberate in its suspension of all\nlinguistic procedure, in order to allow an attention to be focussed on a\nphonological form.\n\nIn a capitalistic, referentialist context, criticism is that which vali-\ndates a text; it is an exterior energy brought to focus on a divided form\nand designed to alter perception of that form. Criticism of this kind is a\ndivided labour from the text. In language-centered writing, where\nciphericity is dominant, criticism fuses with creativity and becomes an\ninternal quality of the text itself. Internal criticism of this kind takes the\nform of a foregrounding of the problematics of the verbal sign as the\nsign itself displays this in its own truncation.\n\nBy eliminating grammatical armament from language, by a freeing\nof the parts to be themselves and by inviting the reader into this\nimmanence of text, the full, polysemous possibilities of language are\nopened up. Reference is no longer the promise at the end of the gram-\nmatical road, no longer the opiate of the reader. Rather the text\nbecomes the communal space of a labour, initiated by the writer and\nextended by the second writer (the reader). So we break, finally, the\ndivisive structure of the conventional reading process. The old duality\nof reader \u2014 writer collapses into the one compound function, and the\ntwo actions are permitted to become a simultaneous experience within\nthe activity of the engager.\n\nLanguage-centering: the ontologic core: that there is no anterior\nidentity; that authorship becomes the internal quality of text.\nCounter-communication of this kind might also mark a significant\nextension of Olsonian field theory in projective verse from the sense of\nthe poem as occupying a mediate position as energy field, supplied by\nthe writer and drawn from by the reader, to the concept of the poem as\na rotating energy source, a translative construct in which the written\ntext is subject to re-writing in reading, thereby refracting the energy\npresent. What is proposed then, is a specific application of reading to\nfunction as a writing that transforms the text.\n\ni) remove the arrow of reference, no alternity. no direction outward,\nii) replace it with word, letter, phoneme or grapheme i.e. with the\n\npoint of place and event.\n\nIs the Cipher similar to Wittgenstein\u2019s \u2018formal concept\u2019? Quote:\nFormal concepts cannot, in fact, be represented by means of a function,\nas concepts proper can.\n\nFor their characteristics, formal properties are not expressed by\nmeans of functions. Unquote (Wittgenstein, Tractatus 4.126). And\nearlier: \u2018When something falls under a formal concept as one of its\nobjects, this cannot be expressed by means of a proposition. Instead it\nis shown in the very sign for this object.\u2019\n\nIs a word a place that meaning can exist in?\n\n... Language: i.e. overall proficiency with localized ignorance.\nReference: the continentalist drive in language.\n\n\u2018Names are like points; propositions like arrows.\u2019 (Wittgenstein). So\nthe cipheral text must be nominal at base.\n\nClearly then, language-centered writing involves the most deter-\nminate poetics yet proposed in the history of writing. Determinate\nbecause it avoids the central contradiction of the Linguistic Sign \u2014 the\nuse of an absence to re-present a present. Reference is that absence,\nleading out from a present sign to an extrasemiotic state: the imposed\nself-destruction of language in the world \u2018of real things\u2019.\n\nThe Cipher, and language-centered counter-communication in\ngeneral provides a text in which the sign names itself a present naming\nwith signs standing period; not signs standing for an absence.\n\nCODICIL\n\ncollides triangle lucid nap\n\nbroad wet exertion\n\nsift plunges\n\nhalo shallows\n\nlean-to precocious\n\ntrickle blade\n\nrailing fluency plankton abrupt\nsea\u2019s rib\n\nglows lobes (Ray Di Palma)\n\nConventional reading patterns promote the sense of a linguistic mask:\na desire to get beyond the words themselves or alternatively \u2018beneath\u2019\nthem into a region of reference: of images, symbols and ideas that the\nsurface syntagms seem somehow to withhold from us. Conventional\nreading hence resists the sheer fact of a text\u2019s graphic immanence.\nSurface. Words, traditionally, are seen to simultaneously reveal and\nobscure intents and meanings, with the Sign\u2019s own mask taking the\nform of the signifier that transports \u2014 yet at the same time delays \u2014 the\ndestination in the signified. Di Palma\u2019s piece demonstrates the kinetics\nof mask (as we \u2018read\u2019, \u2018see\u2019 or scan it there are certain lexic movements,\nassociations etc.; there are adjacencies, contiguities but no pre-\nordained connections, yet it is a mask without depth. As readers we\ncome to feel the movement perse as a movement without destination\nupon a surface of text. It mobilizes an object quality, property of\nimmanence, replacing depth by the parallel, sympathetic sense of sur-\nface complexity by which mask becomes moebius and depth a surface\nfold.\n\nThis emphasis upon surface movement suggests a topological\nanalogy that helps get us further into the essential movement and\nstructure of these texts. \u2018Topology represents the primary intellectual\noperation capable of revealing the modalities of surfaces, volumes,\nboundaries, contiguities, holes, and above all the notions of inside and\noutside, with the attendant ideas of insertion, penetration, contain-\nment, emergence and the like.\u20191 An interesting analogy presents itself\nin the instance of the Klein Worm \u2014 a form which differs form conven-\ntional geometric forms in its characteristic absence of both inner and\nouter surfaces.2\n\n\u2018Instead you have a contained tube and an uncontained tube, a contained hole\nand an uncontained hole ... Any part of the form can touch, contact,\ncommunicate with, flow with any other part... We have a quality of\ncontinuousness in the form and at the same time intraconainment... (This\nform) is permeated by context. It has no walls. Yet it uses its structural\ninfolding for maintaining itself changing in a sufficiently regular way to find\nnew relations.\u20193\n\nBruce Morrissette has already applied this analogy to the narrative\nstructure in Robbe Grillet\u2019s novels,4 but here I would like to extend\nthat application to counter-communicative writing and utilize that\nKlein form as a model of the actual mechanism of reading.\n\nwlkt sTdh\n\n( FPRTO\n\nT\n\n(ff)\n\nTts\n\nxcphj t\tt\n\ncb (mccaffery)\n\nThe above is a Klein Form. The text is \u2018without walls\u2019, it is open field\nor \u2018constellational\u2019 with the principle of syntax replaced by that of\nmilieu. A reading activates certain relational pathways, a flow of parts,\nand \u2014 denied the exteriorizing force of reference \u2014 a structural\n\u2018infolding\u2019 of the textual elements. Sign itself is a topological aspect of\ntext with the referent and signified \u2018outside\u2019 the text, and the signifier\n\u2018inside\u2019. The excommunication of the referent and the established\nsurplus of signifiers can be seen as a complication both of surface and\nof the nature of interior!ties. For the signifier, when devoid of its\nsignified (i.e. cipher), is like an inferiority without the drive to exter-\nnalization.\n\nFragmentation: i.e. as that which creates the notion of textual\nequality. \u2018Phonemes of the Word fragment! You have nothing to lose\nbut your referents!\u2019. Non-grammatical emphasis is equal emphasis.\nNon-subordination. Non-hierarchy. Hence multi-directional.\n\nIn fragmentation there is no external support lent to a signifier from\nthe signified for that very relation is severed in the act of fragmenta-\ntion. Result: a surplus state of signifiers. Ciphers. Non-grammatical\nsurface interplays of signifying elements:\n\nap\n\nice ism out play\nelph eps oop\nure er ut ed\nsense ratum camel\n\nhan\n\nng\n\nmand (Amirkhanian)\n\nSuch a poem is neither a verbal stimulant nor a verbal tranquillizer,\nbut rather a paraverbal surface onto which a reader is invited to step\ninto productive effort. What it is not is textual commodity, replete\nwith reference to be consumed by \u2018an understanding\u2019 reader. The\ndemand is for praxis not consumption.\n\nBy investing total energy into counter-communication, language-\ncentered texts become surface pressures that functionally dislocate the\nreader. Syntax. More milieu than syntax with the letter very often\nthe basic unit of organizaton. Andrews speaks of\u2018each word being a\nsyntax\u2019. The letter in space with self-generating aura. Letter clusters\nand the occasional word where meaning is held to reverb not connect\ninto larger compounds:\n\nmel\n\nethwe fiib sditas (Melnick)\n\nI\n\nThat is, the elevation of letter to morphologic status.\n\nI believe it to be in the work of Melnick, Silliman, Coolidge, Di\nPalma and Andrews that a new concept of the meaningful is emerging,\na concept based not upon communication but upon a creative entry\ninto the opacity of evacuated signs. It is perhaps less a new concept of\nmeaning than a new attitude to the place of meaning within and\nwithout a language set. For what it suggests is this: that meaning is\ndependent on the context of attention that a reader brings to his text;\ni.e. meaning is the sum total value that a reader puts into a piece.\nMeaning: what the reader brings as praxis, not what the reader takes\naway7 as reference. So we can see how language-centered writing\nenforces a charity, a total givingness of reader and writer to their texts.\nTexts so long have been those things which a reader has raped, drawn\nout of, now is the moment of the text\u2019s receiving into itself. And the\nreader? An extension of vocabulary, both operator and component of a\ntextual event.\n\nCipher is the baptism of the residual. The sign on holiday.\n\nScript and Language. A poem enters the domain of script when the\nletter assumes the role of formal unit and stereographic relation\nbecomes its major quality. Relations graphed across a surface that\naffirm their own immanence, their own autonomous dynamic. The\nscriptive would be in contrast to the linguistic poem whose basic unit is\nthe word and whose radical property is signfication.\n\nIn his book Space, Coolidge moves from language into script (as\ndoes Melnick in pcoet), into the manufacture of graphic events\n(\u2018graphemes\u2019) within a stereographic space:\n\nerything\neral\nstantly\nined\nards\ncal\nnize\n\nNote, however, that Coolidge plays upon familiar reading patterns,\nadopting truncations that suggest complete vocabularies. As a result\nthere\u2019s a bifurcation in the reading experience between the feeling of\ninstant graphic events seen before you as complete discontinuities; and\nthe felt possibility of developing continuities the more the reader\napproaches the text from familiar paradigms:\n\neverything\nmineral\ninstantly\ndefined\ntowards\noptical\ncanonize\n\nsuggests the type of\u2018completion\u2019 and textual writing possible. Note\ntoo how both the spatial placement of the graphemes and the sheer fact\nof their density command equal attention. It\u2019s the finely executed\nbalance of these two qualities of space and density that inform the best\nlanguage centered pieces. Compositionally it\u2019s the engineering of\nthese two drives towards a form understood as both potential sign and\nmatter that is central. Syntax is transformed to become a calculus of\ndensities and a geomantic ordering of pure experiences (\u2018events\u2019 as\nevents are \u2018signs without histories\u2019).\n\nThe balancing of space and density results in the concretization of\nthe cipher, the emptying of the sign of its function and the presentation\nof the signifier as truncated materiality. It is hence oppositional to any\nabstract poetics and stands comparison to concrete poetry in the\nmanner in which both isolate verbal elements in order to demonstrate\ntheir own structures and ontologies without the obstacle of referring\nto a thing outside their present being and shape.\n\nwoe\teroa\n\nasrglry s\n\nwea tiro\tbohmuluk\n\ncodfix\ta,azz oboi (Melnick)\n\n\n\nLinguistic endgame? Or scriptive project? A poem that anchors its\nelements as a field of prelinguistic chromosomes that embody the\nenergies which may develop into word or into event, is an accoustic, a\ncipheral happening. Appreciation of potential per se, of that quality in\nsigns that Wittgenstein insists we recognize at the beginning of The\nTractatus: that every actual instance embodies all the possibilities it\ncould have been. The paradigm is always on the back of the syntagm.\nAnd more recently Sartre in The Critique of Dialectical Reason that\n\u2018every word ... contains the whole of language and reaffirms it.\u2019\n\nPossibility is an immanence.\n\n... and asking the reader grasp a poems ontology within the sum total\nof its unrealized potential, with that potential considered as the coiled\nbut ready reflex of the sign anterior to its thrust outward into refer-\nence.\n*\n\nTo suggest then that meaning be considered (if at all) as a doubleness\naround the core of the cipher: meaning as encipherment, a consolida-\ntion of the status of the vacated word; and meaning as decipherment or\nthrust towards completion of a partial sign. Meaning here, is not the\nproduct nor the attendant of a referring, not a destination outside of\nthe living event of the words and graphic shapes; it is rather the\noccasioning of a focus upon text, that environment which encom-\npasses such readings and makes them possible. In other words, lan-\nguage centered texts respond better to a sense of meaning as an\nimported context into decontextualised language zones.\n\nDecontextualization, the salient feature of language centered\nwriting, serves to return language elements to their primary mean-\nings. Within the parameters of readership what is opposed is a simple\nto a complex readability. Readability becomes complicated when lan-\nguage is made conscious of itself and of its source exterior to the\nsequential progress of the line. Andrews is especially successful at such\ncomplications, there is a striking non-gravitational effect within many\nof his pieces that rises from the multiple interlocking of parts and the\nreplacement of linear direction by a vertical and horizontal balancing\nwhich creates a tracery in spatial neutrality and highlights the coronal\nnature of the graphemes:\n\nca ja a th an ne sh th wa pe\nqu ci fo in ba wh vi re se th\neu co st cu wo al su cr ce re\nin ma vi si ba am ch qu an is\nth th cu ni se fa wo ap se th\npr st th st th th ac wh wh pa\n\nwi ha wa ti bo pr wo fe th tr\nfa sp if so th th pl fo to tw\n\nThe weight of the iconicity plus the weight of the possibilities to\nindex. Andrews here takes the word beyond its lexical base (that base\nin definition where each word operates independently from out of its\ndictionary force of isolation) to the pre verbal region of the operating\nletter.\n\nTime and Tense.\n\nTo remove reference in the way that language centered writing does, is\nf\tto radically alter the category of linguistic time. Most critically it\n\nremoves tense as a temporal issue within a text through a centering of\ntime utterly within the assertion (the happening) of each lexeme.\nCipheral time is the time of each word \u2018happening,\u2019 accumulating into\nthe total time of the text\u2019s happening itself, as text here is the duration\nof the reading.\n\npulling banters flank blonde\nfolded captain girlfriend hisself\ndrive leg chemist\u2019s punching\nfire milling cuffs naw\ncaptain madman ways roast\nbags excitedly ass bad (Andrews: \u2018The Red Hallelujah\u2019)\n\nThe self-standing word is the word which is free from imposed con-\ntext. It resides within its lexical basis, within its total content. \u2018Blonde\u2019\nholds a totality of content and a range of possible application that an\nadditional (contextualizing) phrase \u2014 the blonde hairdresser \u2014 serves\nto restrict and which, \u2018The young, blonde, hairdresser in Schumaker\u2019s\nvariety store\u2019 restricts even further. This is not to suggest by the term\n\u2018total content\u2019 the word as a generalization, or as somehow\nnonspecific, but rather to emphasize the tractable weight of the single\nword when freed from specific use; the open-endedness of its indexi-\ncality; its processual, non-commodity nature; the single word as the\nin-gathered point of infinite application. It is the ability to contain this\nkind of paradigmatic structure within the syntagmatic instance that is\nresponsible for the tremendous density in this kind of writing. In a\ngrammatical line of discourse, a word must assume a chosen context,\nand enter into a divisive labour. Freed, however, from the enforced\ncommunality that is grammar, the word approaches its own totaliza-\ntion and we are forced to encounter the word frontally as an absolute\nproperty.\n\nAs to page in language-centred discourse?\n\n\n\nPage, as before, remains an interpretive space. The page is no less than\nthe sign for attention itself. A geographical cipher. The non-referring\ngesture of the language-centered writer is hence to fill an empty sign\n(the page) with further ciphers. Text and page relate as a cipheral\npalimpsest or even cipheral pun. Cipher on top of cipher \u2014 the sexu-\nality of the emptied sign and the maximization of all possibilities of\nwhat the signs can index.\n\nWe descend into their emptiness to experience how full they can be.\nOrpheus.\n\neras\n\ntory\n\nien\nbined\n\nswer\nft\npriv\nlat\ta ge\n\nhyst\n\ntrem\n\ni h (from Piec., bruce andrews)\n\nWhen a text is perceived, it is that thing. Is there a difference be-\ntween reading and seeing this piece? What precisely is the psycholin-\nguistic experience of a translation from the seen into the read and from\nthe read into the seen?\n\nLanguage-centered writing displays language in opacity gained by\nthis subtle balancing of the literate and the perceptible. To see language\nis to experience its opacity; to read signs is to pursue their operations of\nspatial discharge. The above text is fragment only if the mind cares to\nretreat back into its familiar lexical associations and refuse to take a\nstand upon the dialectical pinion of the seen and the read. This poem is\na poem of absolute denotation, a total condition of self-reflexive sign\nstructured by aura rather than syntax and stressing the sign\u2019s own\nexcess of presence precisely because there is no operating reference. It\nis a patterned cipher whose gravity obtains from a surplus of significa-\ntion. It is over-determined and hence a presentness. It cannot be\nlocated in any category and thus is not context bound. A signifier\nwithout a signified and whose destination is inward to the center of its\nown form.\n\nIn other words the condensation of the sign: the centripetal move-\nment of the cipher into the core of its very being and executed prior to\nits being called upon as traditional vehicle programmed to an outside\ndestination. Condensation brings the experience of such texts to the\n\nsurface of the page where script meets the threshold of a reading at the\npoint of\u2018seeing signs.\u2019\n\nThe cipher. The art of the deficient message that\u2019s characterized by\nshifts in linguistic form from grammar to lexis, from closed, contex-\ntual form to open de-contextual set. Foucault, writing of the modern\ncondition of language, states it has become a thing of space: \u2018a univ-\nersal space of inscription.\u2019 Once the fallacy of the referent is revealed\nfor what it is then we are able to see language as that highly complex\nplay of signifiers detached from stable signifieds; a language no longer\nrepresenting a world outside of itself, but a language obeying its own\nconstitution and dynamic. I take cipher to be this: the natural exten-\nsion of language in our time and in the pressures, relations and con-\ntradictions of this age, beyond the referentially anchored sign into a\nmetaphysics of presence unparalleled in past writing. Shapes made to\nstay and we to experience that abidance. It is the particular gift of such\nwriters as Ron Silliman, Bruce Andrews, Clark Coolidge and Ray\nDiPalma to have provided the first instantiated phase of post-literate\nwriting; the first to understand (and to thrust out a solid poetics from\nthat understanding) of the structural divisiveness of literacy: the\nmetaphysics of its absence in the thrust of reference out of the ignored\npresence of script; and its tragic separation of reader from writer by the\nhorizontal line of\u2018communication\u2019 and the vertical axis of the poem as\ncommodity.\n\nHappy trails to that interface.\n\nNOTES\n\ni Bruce Morrissette, \u2018Topology and the French Nouveau Roman\u2019 in\nBoundary2, r.i.

Superimposed on the homeostat is a group of\nfixatives, cultural ready-mades, media phrasing, the hyperbolic naivete\nof poetic sentiment, the prayer-negotiation\/poem as visualization of Truth.\nThe work is at once a filatory of jumping threads and the impasto de-\nsign its after-band \u2014 a double exposure on one plate \u2014 her dress, like\nher language, is a galimatias of several countries.\n\n     Contrast the maieutic, parliamentary drain on poetic resource\nwhich has wide currency, the prosecution of tabloid epiphanies for which\nDouble Exposure is satiric depository (\u201d We\u2019re kept snug and amused as\nTV innards newsreels old workmates repeats and their catchphrases rerun\non similar lines below \u201d). The routine theology is cued, made implor-\ningly histrionic, and is precisely contravened by cat-calling, writing\nthe oath, with its physical counterpart the excretion. References to\npunk rock recall this profanation of the Host (the Pistols vomiting on\ntheir audience) of which the typical exemplar must be the invert Howard\nHughes with his cultivation of dead matter: hair, nails, urine. The\nprinciple of work is writing as e-limination, the expulsion of dead\ntruths \u2014 \u201d wipes away dirt like a dream \u201d \u2014 wastrel action as the only\nfreedom in art, writing as rubbish\u2014\u201d pertinent; essential; the most\nintricate presence in our entire culture \u201d (Prynne) \u2014 burning on the\ncity limits, pushing itself in every sense into the margin.\n\n     The greater part of what is still referred to as the avant-garde\nis still concerned for wheedling re-valuation, the vulgarization of\nTruth as a positive control, justice dispensed as a pill. (There is\nsupposed to be an \u2019alternative\u2019 society, an \u2019alternative\u2019 truth:\n\u201d Pretence that times are changing outside technology \u201d.) On the face\nof it, Double Exposure assigns itself to Nietzschean de-valuation of\nall values, and in fact the stages of a career in Ward have the de-\nlightful consistency of inversion; the early interest in TM leads him\nfrom the cultivated nomadics of Tales from the Snowline directly to the\nindecent politics of Double Exposure: a movement from passive to active\nnihilism, a \u2019Buddhism of action\u2019.\n\n     The commonplace poetry of to-day is inefficient through misalle-\ngation of one or another substantiation of its presence^ But new work\ncan excise the ground of any such operation by \u201d damage to \/ and peeling\nof \/ the original negatives \u201d, an ablatitious force that diminished gravi-\ntation to given meta-discourse, seen as the negative of photographic\nprint. The contemporaneity of \u2019double exposure\u2019 is exact: the way The\nOrators was, the way Behind The State Capitol still is.\n\n        ROD MENGHAM"},{"uid":"RodMengham_Raworth_1978","author":"Rod Mengham","shortTitle":"Raworth","title":"Rod Mengham | Raworth | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn6\/pictures\/023.html","text":"RAWORTH\n\n\nfrom LOGARHYTHMS\n\nTom Raworth, Logbook (1976; Poltroon Press, 2315 Carleton, Berkeley, CA;\n$7.50)\n\n\n         And I am busily sweeping up the last few words in a country\n         without an ear, whose artists are busy filling in the colours\n         they\u2019ve been allocated in the giant painting-by-numbers picture\n         of themselves, because they think an interview with the man\n         (now a physicist in Moscow) who was the boy on the Odessa Steps\n         makes a connection.\n\n\n     The connection is that imagined between something whose claim to\nmeaning is what it was recognized for, and the subject of an expropriation,\na resistance to the fading away of a subject in which the past is regulated\nby future needs. For the boy on the Odessa Steps was part of a diction\nwhich no longer obtains, and the physicist in Moscow will prevent our\nrealizing the history of that. Thus the tense in which Logbook is written\nis the post-prophetical present\u2014it will not be depleted by \u2019culture.\u2019\nAnd by that I mean what culture is recognized as being (culture at the\ncognitive level):\n\n\n         \u201dHe planted that word twenty years ago so that its weight is\n         now exactly right\u201d\u2014that\u2019s the message of \u2019culture,\u2019 the real\n         cold, science.\n\n\n     For Raworth the word is not an implantation, a seclusion of meaning\naway from processes of renovation (there are a great number of novels and\npoems officially retired) but a disclosure, in a work of dehiscence\u2014the\ndischarge of mature contents. The proper meaning of maturity as of some-\nthing instant, and not a state which you finally reach and then persist in.\n\n     If we think we understand this text it is not by way of consolation\nfor the monopoly of \u2019literature\u2019; \u2019literature\u2019 borrows its own meaning\nfrom a global repertoire and gives them only a limited territory in which\nthey can work. This demarcation is political, like a red line on the map\n\n\nignored by the elements: \"For this is the battle: between the vegetables\nand the rocks. And we are the disputed territory\u2014we, and the water we\ncome from and are.\" In fact we are the subjects of a repertoire such that\nwe can exclude ourselves from parts of it or force ourselves not to:\n\"Until finally writing becomes the only thing that is not a petroleum by-\nproduct, or a neat capsule available without prescription.\" Writing is\nthe excessive production from which more:meanings escape than can be\ncontained and given a place, and if \u2019culture\u2019 can afford to be more and\nmore intolerant, or restfully ignorant of its subversion by writing, that\nis because the massive extension of criticism has actually imposed on\n\u2019literature\u2019 a greater scope than it knew it already had, persuading us\nof its competence through an ability to account for an unprecedented\nnumber of the strange materials from which it borrows\u2014when it omits every-\nthing which it is not in order to be systematic.\n\n         It\u2019s the front room, and the queen\u2019s picture flickers into a\n         limp book called Jimi Hendrix because all books are dead &\n         we live where the edges overlap.\n\n     There are other complicities of meaning some of which rely on complete\nsubterfuge as they must to remain so fragile they can withstand the brutal\ncoherence of civility. That maladaptation of ourselves whom writing may\neffectively put back into circulation is civility in the belief we are\nconsenting members of the constituency of the book. So then it is impor-\ntant to traduce the accredited image of the book, and Logbook seems to be\nthe record of an expedition whose parade of \u2019culture\u2019 might be directly\nprovoking, and the representative value of its language could only be\ninstated by force:\n\n         Around us was the countryside of Whimsy where, huddled around\n         leaping orange fires, the natives let their cigarettes dangle\n         unlit in their mouths, thinking only petrol or butane could\n         light them.\n\nThis refers to a colonial discourse like that of Voyage au Bout de ta\nUuit where the Europeans have power through a monopoly on money and\nlanguage. We ought to note that forty years ago the question of agency\nwas still an effective anxiety, and that now the honest intervention has\nto be whimsical. The only way in which the natives can know the rules is\nthrough being guilty of a breach; this is the position which writing can\nrefuse to occupy, and it does so if it is contrary. The adroitness is a\ncondition necessary for the act of restitution in which disobedience to\nthe laws of consistency is freed from its social stigma of worthlessness\nand restored to an expressive capacity....\n\n     Intermittent form is the basis of a text which is the presence of\nhistory, exactly like a log-book: not wholly irregular but punctuated by\n\n\na regularity which is transitory, \u2019\u2019slightly charred by the slow still\nsilent instant.\u201d It has an essential readiness which is measured not by\ncoherent size but the sudden insistence of its distracted parts\u2014\u201da form\ncan be used once only.\u201d Our understanding of the text is the activation\nof these diverging parts, the instant in which their mutual pressure is\nsufficient to open the text for us.\n\nROD MENGHAM\n\n\n\n\nRAWORTH BIBLIOGRAPHY: Weapon Man (1965, broadside, Cape Goliard\nPress, London).

Yet this book projects a\nmemory not of the self, but of the self as defined by the knowledge\nwhich makes up the self, which perceives the world in which the self\nlives. And in this sense Bernadette Mayer\u2019s new work is a cosmology,\nan encyclopedia, an anatomy, which as a genre is related to Menippean or\nVarronian verse satire, from the Greek cynic Menippus and the Roman\nsatirist Varro, both now lost. The anatomy has continued in Lucian,\nPetronius, Apuleius, Rabelais, Voltaire, Swift, Rousseau, Peacock, and\nin our own century, Aldous Huxley, Wyndham Lewis, Djuna Barnes, and most\n\n\nrecently, in Seeking Air by Barbara Guest. Unlike the picaresque\u2014which\nis a satire of society, of its structures\u2014the anatomy is a satire built\nup through a presentation of a vision \"of the world in terms of a single\nintellectual pattern.\" Northrop Frye continues (in Anatomy of Criticism).\n\"The intellectual structure built up from the story makes for violent\ndislocations in the customary logic of narrative, though the appearance\nof carelessness that results reflects only the carelessness of the\nreader or his tendency to judge by a novel-centered conception of fic-\ntion.\" The shortest form of the anatomy is the dialogue, but there is\na strong tendency toward a display of erudition, of encyclopedic know-\nledge, of complications, catalogues and lists (see Burton\u2019s Anatomy of\nMelancholyTristram Shandy Flaubert\u2019s Bouvard et Pecuchet, Norman\nDouglas\u2019 South Wind^ and portions of Moby Dick,),\n\nDoes Mayer know anatomies? Perhaps not. The impulse here seems to come\nas much from her obsession with memory, from a compulsion towards auto-\nbiography that is related to the confession such as Saint Augustine\u2019s,\nBut for Mayer memory is never an end in itself. It is not memory past\nthat most interests her, but memory continuing, repeating, memory in the\npresent made new through language in Pound\u2019s sense, Mayer\u2019s art is not\na seeking for what was but what was is, and how what is was made by that\npast. Mayer\u2019s memory is not nostalgic\u2014as in Proust\u2014but is a past that\nmakes the new, makes for the new: an ending that is a beginning (\"Each\nend is a beginning\"). She seeks not for old structures, not for a re-\ncreation but for a decreation: \"I put these words on paper because they\nwere once written by me, no, I too yearn for a world without meaning.\"\nAs she previously wrote in her novel Memory, \"A whole new language is a\ntemptation.\"\n\nBut Mayer\u2019s world, the world she discovers, is not without meaning. The\npast decreated gives rise to a new created, a recreated world. As with\nAdam, Mayer calls into meaning by naming, by naming a past. Through\nmemory\u2019s order \"Hemispheres become loose in the country, there are new\nforms.\"\n\nIs this different from a Surrealist allowing the subconscious to create\nnew structures, using dream images as the basis for a new reality? Yes.\nMayer\u2019s past is not a dream, not archetypal, not mythical, but a socially\n\u2022lived experience. These are school notes, a pre-existent text rewritten\n(?) or almost intact, a life wrenched out of chronological context not\nby chance but by fact, a life perhaps not experienced as discontinuous\nbut was (and because was can only be is in memory) is in fact.\n\nNo coy discontinuity is this, no clever disassociations. Actually there\nis an attempt in Eruditio at lucidness, to see through the veil of\nexperience to a reality of flux, of life, of duration. And in this there\nis a basic recognition of the ineffectuality, of the destructiveness of\n\n\nthe written word as opposed to spoken language (re Derrida). \"There\u2019s\nno use writing down Greek words if no one is going to know what I\u2019m\nsaying.\" Mayer is always after language, then, after the reality that is\nlanguage. Eruditio is a search for that reality not as written word but\nas language, which as a thought process is the thing itself. Saying is\nthinking is perceiving is knowing. In fact, although this work may\noften seem ineffable, there is throughout a drive for an absolute clarity\nof language: \"Add up a column of numbers, it comes to William Carlos\nWilliams.\"\n\nAll of which brings us back to the genre of anatomy, which comes from\nthe Greek anatome, a cutting up, an analysis or minute examination, to\nto show or examine the position, structure and relation of the parts.\nThat is what this book is to me; it is an attempt to explain, to demon-\nstrate, to show how Mayer has come to know whatever it is she has come\nto know. And in that sense, this book is a sharing, a removal of the\nveil, an admission, an apology, a true confession.\n\nMoreover, in that it is itself a sign, an image, an emblem of language\nwhich stands for Mayer and the world she has recreated, an emblem like\nthe red letter Hester Prynne wears. Eruditio ex Memorza ends with such\nan image: \"In a painting I am a Chinese woman turning away from a bowl\nof fruit.\" Is this an Eve with a second chance, this time redeeming\nby giving up the knowledge, by releasing it? To pin the image down that\nway is to miss the point, is to turn back to the fruit and eat it. It\nis nothing more than itself, a Chinese woman turning away from a bowl\nof fruit, \"its own sure image.\"\n\n        DOUGLAS MESSERLI\n"},{"uid":"DouglasMesserli_NonPoetry_1979","author":"Douglas Messerli","shortTitle":"Non-Poetry","title":"Douglas Messerli | Non-Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/026.html","text":"\nDOUGLAS MESSERLI :\n\nThe following five \"non-poetry\" books have had a direct influence on\n    my writing and thinking:\n\n    Ezra Pound, Gaudier Brezska (New Directions, 1974, 1978).\n\n    Gertrude Stein, How Writing Is Written, ed. by Haas (Black Sparrow,\n        1977).\n\n    Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, trans, by Spivak (Johns Hopkins\n        Univ.

Horace\u2019s Ars Poetica is the fit monument to the\nliving-death practices of the Movement, the Conquest conquistadors, the\nArts Council\u2019s literary commissar, Radio Three\u2019s \u2019Poetry Now\u2019, the Dulwich\nGroup, Oxford\u2019s professor of poetry, and the rest. There would be no\npoint in lambasting their dullness and Grub Street jostlings for power\nexcept that their tastes and publicist talents dominate the Press and the\neducational system. The belief is that poetry is decoration, the accom-\npaniment of conspicuous consumption. In fact a conjugation of Horace\nwith Thorstein Veblen\u2019s The Theory of The Leisure Class (1899) can show\nthe Romanised decadence of the predatory literary bosses, and their\npatrons. Ars Poetica lays down advice and duties for the would-be\n\u2019successful\u2019 poet \u2014 decorum and good taste through genres placed in a\nhierarchy of acceptable types, adaptations of accepted models, obedience\nto fixed criteria which criticism is believed to contain. The young are\nadvised to imitate the older, to please patrons, to reject cathartic or\nany other disturbing experience in art. The poet is the servant of\npatronage. Poetry is a pastime. Greek originals are reduced from complex-\nity to consumer simplicities. The artist is a conformist entertainer....\nForm must follow social utility. The predatory class dictates the limits\nof creativity, and would place a boundary on extasy and the outward\nfigure of inventiveness. Poetry is part of leisure along with comedians\nand cigarettes, \u2019my car\u2019 and \u2019the box\u2019. In Veblen\u2019s terms, \u2019the criteria\nof past performance of leisure therefore commonly takes the form of\n\u2019immaterial\u2019 goods\u2019: \u2019shrewd mimicry and a systematic drill have been\nturned to account in the deliberate production of a cultured class\u2019. If\na poem cannot be owned, as part of property and possessions, or be a\nhymn to an established cause or cult, it should not exist. To be posses-\nsed by a poem or a performance, however briefly the catharsis may be,\nstrikes terror to the leisure class because, like the presence of the new,\nit lies outside the expenditure of energy on money, property, comfort and\ndisciplinarian hierarchy. \u2019The predatory culture\u2019 wishes to annex the\narts, to consume poetry as a luxury or to ignore it altogether or be\ncomforted by its platitudes reinforcing the status quo. To ensure the\ncorrect kind of luxury art, charity is doled out in an inflationary\neconomy, or a totalitarian one, through patronage.... \u2019But in order to\nbe respectable (poetry) must be wasteful\u2019.... In Veblen\u2019s terms, the\nneo-classical performer is governed by a \u2019process of selective adaptation\nof designs to the end of conspicuous waste\u2019: \u2019A limited edition is in\neffect a guarantee \u2014 somewhat crude, it is true \u2014 that this book is\n\n\nscarce and it therefore is costly and lends pecuniary distinction to its\nconsumer\u2019.\n\n     Within the criteria of the leisure class lies the assumption that\ndesign expresses a prior formed thought or feeling, clearly obvious to\nany untrained glance.... To the classicist, shapes are finite.,.. Compo-\nsition is a set of decisions within choices, but improvisation can be\nsimply repetition, as most poetry and jazz in established modes is: that\nis, if has become commercialized design, or it has become the fearful\nrecapitulation of minor artists. The degree of alert creativity within\nintelligence and sensitivity reaches its vanishing point and is supported\nby patronage.... The artist (can) choose against patronage and critics.\nAs Picasso is the last artist to sustain the role of Master Artist...so\nit may be that the role of Master Poet is no longer a viable position \u2014\nor has to be reinvented. Qone alternative to this tradition is the use of\nsystematic procedures as in what\u2019s sometimes called systems-art and\nsystems-poetry.] It is certainly the implication arising within Ron\nPadgett and David Shapiro\u2019s anthology of New York Poets (1970). A group\nmay use systems which group them. Projective verse poets use recognizable\nprocedures which group them as much as poets using heroic couplets in\nQueen Anne\u2019s reign or petrarchan sonnets in Tudor decades.... (Yet) poetry-\nform addiction may, quite as much as criticism addiction, result from a\nman\u2019s or a group\u2019s need for security, for a bounded sense of availability,\na defense against revolutionary art, against the artist who subverts,\ndisrupts, destroys \u2019too far\u2019.... The function of official poetry and\ncriticism is to historicize art, place it in linear succession so that it\nbecomes part of something called \u2019tradition\u2019.... The totalitarian nature\nof official criticism\u2019s inclusiveness is as vampiric as the state system\nit imitates. The New Critics of Nashville in the thirties may be compared\nwith the State Capitalist commissars of taste in the period of Soviet\nsocialist realism, as ideologically coercive predators.

They begin yet again, I hear them, yet hear nothing,\nI\u2019d like to know what they are saying, I knew. Now I seek what censors\nthem within me.\n\n     Revolt acts; indignation seeks to speak. From the start of my\nchildhood, only reasons for becoming indignant: the war, the deportation\nthe Indochinese war, the Korean war, the Algerian war... and so many\nmassacres, from Indonesia to Chile via Black September. There\u2019s no\nlanguage to describe that. There\u2019s no language because we live in a\nbourgeois world, where the vocabulary of indignation is exclusively\nmoral \u2014 well, it\u2019s those morals which massacre and make war. How can\none turn their language against them when one finds oneself censored\nby one\u2019s own language?\n\n     For a long time, I\u2019ve not known how to formulate that question, and\nnow I can\u2019t find words to answer it. Not that it requires other words\nthan ours, but that they arrange themselves spontaneously according to\nstructures which correspond to the moral order of society.\n\n     Language, like the State, has always served the same people. We\nought to distrust all of which the bourgeois say: With this system, at\nleast, we can speak. This system is already a traitor even if it has\nnot betrayed. In the context of order, in dialogue with it, one can\nonly serve it.\n\n     The police are even in our mouths.\n\n     In one\u2019s own solitude, one only holds a dialogue with oneself to\n\n\n  stylize oneself.\n\n       One does not write in order to say something, but to define a place\n  where no one will be able to declare what hasn\u2019t taken place.\n\n       Censorship gags. It reduces to silence. But it doesn\u2019t do vio-\n  lence to language. Only the abuse of language can violate it, by\n  distorting it. Bourgeois power bases its liberalism on the absence of\n  censorship, but it has constant recourse to the abuse of language. Its\n  tolerance is the mask of an otherwise oppressive and effective violence.\n  The abuse of language has a double effect: it saves appearances, and\n  even reinforces its appearance, and it shifts the place of censorship\n  so cleverly that one no longer notices it. Or to put it another way,\n  through the abuse of language, bourgeois power is made to pass for what\n  it is not: a non-constraining power, a \u2019\u2019human\u201d power, and its official\n  policy which standardizes the value of words, in fact empties them of\n  meaning \u2014 whence a verbal inflation, ruining communications within the\n  community, and in the same way censoring it. Perhaps, in order to\n  express the second effect, it\u2019s necessary to create the word SENSURESHIP\n  which by referring to the other would indicate the deprivation of sense,\n  not of speech. Deprivation of sense is the most subtle form of brain-\n  washing, for it operates without the victim\u2019s knowledge. And the infor-\n  mation cult refines that deprivation even more by seeming to stuff us\n  with knowledge.\n\n       Freedom of expression is evidently dependant on the state of\n  language. Apparently, I can say what I like, but in reality I can only\n  do so within the limits of this state \u2014 a state that current usage of\n  language conceals from us. The words, it seems, are there, always\n  available, always equal to themselves. We use them so spontaneously,\n  and they\u2019re at our disposal so naturally, that we cannot suspect them.\n  They\u2019re a currency which seems unable to be false, at least at the\n  specie level. How therefore are we to perceive the sensureship? It\u2019s\n  true that words are words and that sensureship only insinuates itself in\n  the game of their signifieds, but the words we have abused, abuse in\n  their turn. Whence, at this point, the appearance of a new ambiguity:\n  sensureship which acts on us through words (while censorship acts\n  through us against words) acts in other respects on words with a sen-\n  sureship effect: it obliterates their significance, that\u2019s to say, their\n  matter, their body. Thus we discover that the moral order aims at\n  erasing its materiality in every being, in every thing.\n\n       Shit: up to what age did I dare not say that word? And how many\n  other coarse words thus forbidden? All the words of the body. Good\n  taste is one of the morality police. It serves it. It squeezes it\n  round our throats and over our eyes. Good taste is a way of adapting\n  the death of others into the forgetting. And even here, I experience\n  my impotence to chase out my own. How can I treat my sentence so that\n  it refuses the articulation of power? It would necessitate a language\n\n\n  which, in itself, was an insult to oppression. And more than an insult,\n  a NO. How to find a language unusable by the oppressor? A syntax that\n  would send back the spiked words and tear apart the language of all the\n  Pinochets? I write. I have cries in return. There is no liberal\n  power: there\u2019s only a smarter way of fucking us. For every televised\n  fireside conversation, each of us should have replied with a parcel of\n  shit posted to the great shit at the Elysee. Who would salvage that\n  language?\n\n      Writing, trying to write, the primordial question becomes;, how to\n get rid of this? Bury syntax, comrades, it stinks! Okay, but we make\n sentences even so. Go on and speak without taking on a subject, a\n verb, etc. We seek dodges. We change our seduction. We even ask the\n reader to lend a hand instead of always letting it be. The great thing\n is that we are among the bourgeoisie and that, under such a regime,\n there are only the morals which can serve the collective bond. Only,\n in order for the morals to function, the sentence must also function,\n and the words truly say what they say. Well \u2014 that functioning is\n rotten \u2014 rotten since our fathers massacred the workers, the colonized\n and even their brothers, all the while continuing to play the good\n father. Your civilization has big teeth, o fathers, so big that it\n ended by gobbling itself. Now, we must pick over the pile of shit and\n each seek his piece of tongue\/language (langue). No history, every-\n thing\u2019s putrified!\n\n      I write whilst saying to myself: I don\u2019t want to be possessed \u2014\n and yet they trample on my back. I write against meaning, and I write\n to produce a meaning. Always the same overload, and the body is exhaus-\n ted \u2014 yes, the body of words burst beneath the weight. I\u2019d like now\n to work on the level of the sound of language. Or perhaps to miswrite\n (mecrire) as Denis Roche says, crying so rudely: \"Leave your tongues,\n little fathers (my tongue, my tongue, shit), eat your tongues, old dogs,\n while there\u2019s still time!\" But there\u2019s no more time.

But I detect an expansiveness of mood, a willingness to\nlet more, and more kinds of, things into print as if life itself, al-\nways spotlighted in a Schuyler poem, were now accompanied by a quiet\nstipulation: don\u2019t exclude. The results include more intimate detail\nabout the self (even the landscapes now seem as much about the self as\nabout the out-of-doors) ; seemingly less \"poetic\" distance between ori-\nginal notations and finished poem; less direct aiming at the sublime\n(though the poems hit that unfashionable target as much as any being\nwritten), and as a corollary, a good bit of the unlovely, the ignoble,\nand the downright embarrassing; and a bonus of rich anecdote and other\ninformation about the life of this superlative poet and the people and\nplaces in his consciousness.\n\n     The perceptive critic David Kalstone, in a review a few years ago,\nused the metaphor \"perfect pitch,\" to try to account for the magic\nSchuyler gets out of \"things as they are.\" I\u2019m not positive it\u2019s per-\nfect pitch, exactly, since there are some awkward and boring singers\nwith perfect pitch, but I agree that some such metaphor is needed. Of\nall the poets now writing, I can\u2019t think of one less open to the usual\ncritical advances, more needful of direct pointing. Schuyler\u2019s work is\nsimply beautiful, his decisions are invariably inspired decisions,\nwhether about words or about lines (he has, among many other things,\nshowed that skinny lines can be as magical and unarbitrary as lengthy\nones) or about conclusions or whatever. He is the farthest thing from\na theoretical poet (though his intelligence is formidable) and his\nmarvels are subtly marvelous. Which makes it very hard to talk about\nhim. Invariably in trying to do justice to the beauty on the page,\none is reduced to saying: Look! Look how tangible, how remarkably\n\n\nclear, how moving, how masterful, how original. (Anyway, try explain-\ning the dynamics, let alone the beauty, of a line carried across not\nmerely the carriage-return but across and around the syntax, when the\narrangements are subtly varied, absolutely right and yet seemingly\nspontaneous, set down in just the way they occurred, which we know can\u2019t\nbe true\u2014at least not all the time?) As contemporary a poet as he is,\nmixing the highest with the lowest, often casual to the point where one\nfeels, oh well, another Schuyler poem\u2014feels it for a while, until the\npoem strikes\u2014he is contemporary, even experimental, in ways that are\neasy to miss; more so in that his poems imply, clearly draw upon, the\nriches of the poetic past. All of which has made his critical reputa-\ntion far less than it should be. One hopes that finally this will\nchange, with the help of a new publisher, the best, Farrar, Straus.\nEven so, it must be added that reductive, rampaging and non-ostensive\ncritics need not apply. Maybe a metaphor from painting\u2014or tennis? \u2014\ncan be tacked onto perfect pitch, to round out the picture: he makes\nperfect placements (Chardin), never tries to out-power (Connors). The\nmagic is in the touch, the sheer handling.\n\n     Schuyler\u2019s language, his intimate relationship with words, is one\nof the chief areas of his subtlety. He is as interested in language as\nin what his language refers to and evokes, but the spotlight is so\nunemphatic that all that the words do on their own can be missed. If\nYeats and Elizabeth Bishop are lapidary, Schuyler\u2019s musical precision\nhas the juicy lightness and sway of stems and leaves; no less perfect\nbut more spontaneous, more like life itself; not life talking through\nhim (as it presumably does through certain poets) but talk \u2014 art \u2014\nwhich is a part of life rather than something over on the other side\nwhich has given rise to speculation about imitator and imitated, ways\nof reconciliation, etc. So that Schuyler\u2019s poems are words; but in the\nsame way that the flattest of paintings are paintings rather than simply\npaint, his poems are a multitude of things besides. He continually re-\nminds one of all that poems can be and do, all that can happen between\nthe start of a poem and its conclusion. Yet even the more obvious\neffects, such as the jokes and the sharp wit that occasionally surfaces,\nare never apart from the poem: they\u2019re there as parts of poems, which\nhave to do with life, which is color, weather, growth, objects, feelings,\nmemory, structure, gossip, intelligence, humor, language, all.\n\n     The book contains a sequence of poignant poems written at the Payne\nWhitney Clinic in Manhattan\u2014in the middle of which, remarkably, the\npoet can (1) call himself \"Jim the Jerk\"; and (2) ask, as naturally as\nyou would ask about the weather, the $64 question: \"What is a poem\nanyway?\" When it comes to the title poem, 60 pages long in prosy lines\nmany of which are long enough to be two lines, it becomes clear that\nSchuyler can do just about whatever he wants. \"The Morning of the Poem\"\nis an outgrowth of his other long (so we thought) masterpieces, \"The\n\n\nCrystal Lithium\" and \"Hymn to Life.\" The style is what might be termed\nhis Ongoing style, and the poem is an Excursion: from Western N.Y.\nState to Chelsea, Manhattan; to Europe; to childhood; through the poet\u2019s\nmajor and minor concerns, moods, memories, pet peeves, love affairs,\nspecial landscapes; with epic digressions and sometimes dazzling trips\nof the switch. Taking up more than half a book, it is amazingly sus-\ntained. Whereas his shorter poems normally grow out of very specific\nsettings, with the poet often literally sitting in the middle, here\nhis memory and associations work to make past situations immediate:\nhis entire life somehow becomes the specific setting. There is a tone\nof nostalgia, even wistfulness \u2014but also a mood of acceptance which\nincludes the regrets and difficult times. Not philosophical or reli-\ngious acceptance, he\u2019s not that kind of poet; but acceptance. This is\nhow things are, played upon a guitar that is turquoise, or aqua, with\nsun-drenched frets.\n\n\n     In a characteristically modest way, Schuyler writes that he wants\n\"merely to say, to see and say, things \/ as they are.\" But we can\nhardly take that \"merely\" at face value \u2014 in fact the only conceivable\nway to take it is the way Yeats used it in \"The Second Coming\": abso-\nlutely. For all the pure observation and diary jottings, which are\nindeed central to his method as a poet, and which include plain or off-\nhand statement (sometimes determinedly, or even perversely, so?) clearly\nnot in the same league with his most inspired, one is hard put to find\nanything that doesn\u2019t work. And in the middle of hunting, one comes\nupon a small gem like \"Footnote,\" or a larger one like \"Song\" (\"The\nlight lies layered in the leaves ...\"), or the haunting\u2014for once\nthat horrible word really applies\u2014\"Korean Mums.\" If this is the morn-\ning of the poem, the forecast for the rest of the day must be glorious.\nOr as this quintessentially modest poet was moved to say, one and only\none time (in a wonderful poem that was omitted from this book but will,\nI hope, be in the next): \"Many \/ think that I am modest: \/ they could\nnot be more mistaken. \/ I\u2019m a great poet: no other way.\"\n\nCHARLES NORTH\n"},{"uid":"CharlesNorth_NonPoetry_1979","author":"Charles North","shortTitle":"Non-Poetry","title":"Charles North | Non-Poetry | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/027.html","text":"CHARLES NORTH :\n\n1.

T. PRINCE\n\nF. T. PRINCE, Collected Poems (The Sheep Meadow Press, c\/o Horizon, 156\nFifth Avenue, New York, NY 10010; $4.95)\n\n\n     This small but extraordinary poetic life\u2019s work was cavalierly dis-\nmissed by the NY Times reviewer last spring. Attention was paid to\nPrince\u2019s WW II poem \"Soldiers Bathing\"\u2014this would seem to be party\nline\u2014but that was about it; and I suspect that the set-piece aspect of\nthat poem rather than its inherent beauties is what is keeping it alive.\nThe truth is that Prince\u2019s poems, the best ones, are among the marvels\nof English language poetry, and that this South African-born poet with \/\na handful of brilliantly performed, emotionally and musically rich poems\nredeems buildingsful of modern English verse from the arid intellectu-\nality it is famous for.\n\n     I see Prince as the passionate historian, the passionate scholar,\nemphasis everywhere on passion, which sometimes breaks through the\nscholarly reserve but most often smolders just beneath it, with the re-\nsult that the poems are charged with feeling plus the sense of a struggle\nto hold it back. His inspiration is largely from books. His heroes,\nwhether speakers of dramatic monologues or subjects for meditation from\nthe outside, are historical personages, most often exiles, from native\nland, from civil rights, from youth, from love. And yet upon this con-\nventional base he builds poems that are absolutely original, unique for\ntheir voice, their music, their diction, their quality of feeling, and\nmost strikingly, for their amazing baroque (mannerist?) syntax, which,\n\n\nwithout abandoning its referential obligations\u2014 indeed, which succeeds\nin the most subtle nuancing\u00bb playing off itself, qualifying, extending,\nreversing \u2014 clearly becomes a prime element for its own sake, and finally\na part of the \"meaning\" of the poem in a way we have come to recognize\nas distinctly modern.\n\n     Prince\u2019s unquestionable masterpieces, \"Epistle to a Patron\" and\n\"Words from Edmund Burke,\" appeared in his first book, printed in 1938\nwhen he was 26. As his poetry develops, the rhetoric for its own sake\n(which it both is and isn\u2019t) becomes more and more in the service of\nfeeling, until in the major poems of the 1970\u2019s, \"Memoirs in Oxford,\"\n\"Drypoints of the Hassidim,\" \"Afterword on Rupert Brooke,\" and \"A Last\nAttachment,\" a pared down, much more transparent language is used to\npresent feeling, almost as if Prince had made a conscious resolution to\nput \"childish\" things behind him. Feeling is the key, perhaps it\ndeserves to be called the theme, of the whole book, which fittingly\ncloses with a virtual ode to feeling on the subject of that curious\ncase Lawrence Sterne and his emotional excesses.\n\n     As much as I admire the final group of poems, I wish he hadn\u2019t\nabandoned the bravura. It seems to me that at its height, Prince\u2019s is\na poetry of conjunction (count, for example, the \"and\u2019s\"), and of appo-\nsition: once it gets going, permitted sufficient space and freedom,\nphrases and clauses unroll in marvelous cadences, continue beyond any\nbounds of \"good writing\" until, at least a part of the time, conven-\ntional meaning seems to be just along for the ride. Prince handles\nintellectual matters, of which there are many in the poems, in the\nmanner of the metaphysicals for whom \"thought was an experience\": who\nfelt their thought. His breathtaking images and figures\u2014 \"civil struc-\ntures of a war-like elegance as bridges,\" \"chambers like the recovery\nof a sick man\"(!), \"She is light and dreadful as a spear, she too leaves\na gash,\" (!!)\u2014are as ingenious as any poet\u2019s I know, and yet remain\nsensuous, tied to their base in concrete reality. Which is to say that\nPrince, the Milton and Shakespeare scholar, in his best poetry is a\nbrilliant poet. It seems to me that we feel his thought as well, just\nas we feel and savor his weighty, opulent language.\n\n     In general, although there are some beautiful ones, the weaker\npoems are the short lyrics, where too much Donne, too much Yeats, too\nmuch Verse, or too much convolution in too small a space obscures the\nintent. (If you turn the tables on language, you have to be prepared\nfor language\u2019s partial revenge.) And, at least for me, the last poems\nremain problems. I\u2019ve always found the \"Memoirs\" affecting, a kind of\nPrelude working through early difficulties and trying to make sense of\nthem, including the decision to be a poet; but it\u2019s a curious poem.\n(The current version seems tighter, better than the original one.)\nWritten in a simplified language, in a rimed, metered stanza taken from\nShelley, it has a curiously archaic feel to it: it seems, finally, more\non the side of exercise de style than genuinely modern poem. The other\n\n\nthree, \"Drypoints,\" \"Rupert Brooke,\" and \"A Last Attachment,\" represent\na different genre, almost (one might call it biographical essay in\nverse), and are similarly affecting and similarly problematic. One ad-\nmires the craftsmanship, the deft coilaging from source materials,\nalong with the sensitive treatment of subjects and will to cut through\nreceived opinion; yet one remains\u2014I should say, I remain \u2014 unsatisfied\nby them. None quite transcends its subject matter, as do the great\nearlier poems (to which I would add, certainly, \"The Old Age of Michel-\nangelo\" and \"Chaka,\" and probably \"Soldiers Bathing\"). They\u2019re very\ngood, but Prince\u2019s extraordinary gifts as a poet create extravagant ex-\npectations. Which brings up the continuing, fascinating (to me) question\nof clarity and reticence: is repression good for the poet (as distinct\nfrom the patient) and if so how much. Marianne Moore\u2019s advice to be as\nclear as your natural reticence allows you to be, at this point seems\nonly a part of the story. The difficulty in letting feeling out, ex-\nplicit in the \"Memoirs\" and implicit throughout \u2014 in his exiled or\nabandoned heroes, his virtual obsession with isolation and loss\u2014some-\nhow was responsible for the earlier poems\u2019 emotional charge. Once\nfeeling makes it out into the open, no disguises, the scholar seems to\nregain the upper hand: decorum \"gets by\" passion. I can\u2019t think of a\nhappier find, for anyone, than this poet\u2019s hitting upon the dramatic\nmonologue with its built-in distancing and licensing, post-Browning and\npost-Pound. It let him produce the sinewy, sensual (actually quite sexy)\nterrifically inspiring poem's he should be famous for.\n\n        CHARLES NORTH\n"},{"uid":"MaureenOwen_ReviewsandNotes_1980","author":"Maureen Owen","shortTitle":"Reviews and Notes","title":"Maureen Owen | Reviews and Notes | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/011.html","text":"\nRACHELLE BIJOU, Entrance to the City (Buffalo Press, 15 Laight Street,\nNew York, NY 10013; $2)\n\nMost poets lead at least two lives.

(This refers to capital with the capital L.)\n    Yesterday I borrowed Picabia\u2019s Lagonda for a drive through the Bois.\n    A heavy mist enveloped the park so that we could barely discern the\n    outline of a few silent figures making their way among the sycamores\n    and elms. Emerging at Porte de Neuilly the air grew suddenly clear and\n    ahead to my right I noticed M pushing a perambulator before her with a\n    distracted mien. Her hair fell disheveled about her face, her clothes\n    were threadbare, and every few steps she would pause briefly and look\n    about as if uncertain where she was. I tried many times to draw her\n    attention with the horn, even slowing down at one point and crying her\n    name out the car window, all to no apparent effect. Passing I saw once\n    more (and as it developed, for the last time) the lenticular mark on\n    her forehead and explained its curious origin to my companion, the\n    Princess von K, who in return favored me with her wan smile. We drove\n    on directly to the Chateau de Verre where the Princess lived with her\n    younger sister and a few aged servants. The chateau itself was\n    encircled by the vestiges of a moat now indicated only by a slight\n    depression in the grass at the base of the walls. Or: we drove for\n    hours through the small towns surrounding Paris, unable to decide among\n    various possible courses of action. Or: they have unearthed another\n    child\u2019s body bringing the current total to twenty-eight. Or: nine days\n    from now will occur the vernal equinox. Yesterday in the artificial\n    light of a large hall Ron spoke to me of character hovering unaccept-\n    ably at several removes above the page. The image of the Princess and\n    of M who were of course one and the same returned to mind as I congrat-\n    ulated him on the accuracy of his observation. L knitted this shirt I\n    told him, and carved the sign on my brow, and only yesterday they\n    removed the tree that for so long had interfered with the ordered flow\n    of language down our street. Capital is a fever at play and in the\n    world (silent I) each thing is real or must pretend to be. Her tongue\n    swells until it fills my mouth. I have lived here for a day or part of\n    a day, eyes closed, arms hanging casually at my sides. Can such a book\n    be read by you or me? Now he lowers the bamboo shade to alter the\n    angle of the light, and now she breaks a fingernail against the railing\n    of the bridge. Can such a text invent its own beginning, as for\n    example one\u2014 two\u2014 three? And can it curve into closure from there to\n    here?\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nA FOLLOWING NOTE\n\n\nThe problem is that poetry, at least my poetry and much that interests\nme, tends to concentrate on primary functions and qualities of language\nsuch as naming and the arbitrary structuring of a code\u2014its fragility\u2014\nthe ease with which it empties (nullifies?) itself or contradicts what\nmight simplistically qualify as intention. (And I might add conversely,\nits tyranny\u2014how it resists amendment.)\n\nPoetry seems to inform politically (this being a poetry that does trans-\nmit material of some immediate as well as enduring freshness) beyond\nits aspect as opinion or stance. Thus a Baudelaire, Pound, Eliot et al\nmay render a societal picture of transcendent accuracy. Note of course\nthe political \"intelligence\" of Shakespeare\u2019s Tudor apologies, of\nRacine\u2019s hierarchical poetics, of Dante\u2019s vision. It is clear that\npolitical \"rectitude\" is not necessarily equivalent to political \"use\"\nin a larger sense, though we can also find instances where there is a\ncoinciding of poetic and immediate historical impulse, where in fact a\npoetry transmits its energy from a specifically political moment. Para-\ndoxically I am thinking of a politics that inheres, such as Vallejo\u2019s,\nin contrast let\u2019s say with the more practical motives of much of\nNeruda\u2019s work.\n\n\nPolitics seems a realm of power and persuasion that would like to\nsubsume poetry (and science, and fashion, and...) under its mantle, for\nwhatever noble or base motives. Yet if poetry is to function\u2014politi-\ncally\u2014with integrity, it must resist such appeals as certainly as it\nresists others.\n\n\nThe call to language in a poem does not begin or end with its discursive\nflow and does not give way to qualified priorities. Not to make of\npoetry a \"purer\" occasion, simply to give credit to its terms and the\nrange of possibilities it attends. Poetry seems a making within discete\ntemporal conditions, and I would happily dispense with the word \"cre-\native\". Poetry is profoundly mediational and relative and exists as a\nform of address singularly difficult to describe or define.\n\nA poet\u2019s political responsibility is human, like that of a cabinet-\nmaker or machinist, and his or her activity is subject to similar\nexamination. Synchronically the results are predictably various. We\ntreasure and perhaps survive by those moments when the poetic and\npolitical intelligence derive from an identical urgency and insight.\nRecently I came across Terry Eagleton\u2019s quotation from an article by\nMarx in the Rheinische Zeitung, \"form is of no value unless it is the\nform of its content.\" \"Simple,\" as Zukofsky used to say. And is it if\nit is?\n\n"},{"uid":"MichaelPalmer_fromNotesforEchoLake_1978","author":"Michael Palmer","shortTitle":"from Notes for Echo Lake","title":"Michael Palmer | from Notes for Echo Lake | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn5\/pictures\/017.html","text":"\n\n        PALMER\n\nfrom NOTES FOR ECHO LAKE\n\n        1\n\nHe says this red as dust, eyes a literal self among selves and picks the\ncoffee up.\n\nMemory is kind, a kindness, a kind of unlistening, a grey wall even,\ntoward which you move.\n\nIt was the poet\u2019s wife who remarked that he never looked anyone in the eye.\n(This by water\u2019s edge.)\n\nThis by water\u2019s edge.\n\nAnd all of the song \u2019divided into silences,\u2019 or \u2019quartered in three\nsilences\u2019.\n\nDear Charles, I began and again and again to work, always with no\nconfidence as Melville might explain.

It goes without saying that dissonances\n  and noises are welcome in this new music. But so is the dominant seventh\n  chord if it happens to put in an appearance. A sound does not view itself\n  as thought, as ought, as needing another sound for its elucidation, as\n  etc.; it has no time for any other consideration\u2014it is occupied with the\n  performance of its characteristics: before it has died away it must have\n  made perfectly exact its frequency, its loudness, its length, its over-\n  tone structure, the precise morphology of these and of itself. In view,\n  then, of a totality of possibilities, no knowing action is commensurate,\n  since the character of the knowledge acted upon prohibits all but some\n  eventualities. An experimental action...does not move in terms of approx-\n  imations and errors, as \u2019informed\u2019 action by its nature must...it sees\n  things as the are: impermanently involved in an infinite play of inter-\n  penetrations. Being unforseen, this action is not concerned with its\n\n\n   excuse. That is to say, art is described as being illuminating, and the\n   rest of life as being dark. Naturally, I disagree. If there were a part\n   of life dark enough to keep out of a light from art, I would want to be\n   in that darkness, fumbling around if necessary, but alive. As for the\n   quality of irritation, one might say that it is at least preferable to\n   soothing, edifying, exalting and similar qualities. Its source is, of\n   course, precisely in monotony, not in any forms of aggression or emphasis.\n   It is the immobility of motion. And it alone, perhaps, is truly moving.\n   The responsibility of the artist consists in perfecting his work so that\n   it may become attractively disinteresting. It is better to make a piece\n   of music than to perform one, better to perform one than to listen to\n   one, better to listen to one than to misuse it as a means of distraction,\n   entertainment, or acquisition of \u2019culture\u2019. If the mind is disciplined,\n   the heart turns quickly from fear towards love. One does not make just\n   any experiment, but does what must be done. It is evidently a question\n   of bringing one\u2019s intended actions into relation with the ambient unin-\n   tended ones. The common denominator is zero, where the heart beats (no\n   o\u207fe       to circulate his blood). Of course \u2019it is another school\u2019 \u2014\n\n  this moving out from zero. To begin with, accept that a sound is a sound\n  and a man is a man, give up illusions about ideas of order, expressions\n  of sentiment, and all the rest of our inherited claptrap. What I am\n  calling poetry is often called content. I myself have called it form.\n\n  It is the continuity of a piece of music. Continuity today...is a\n  demonstration of disinterestedness. That is, it is a proof that our\n  delight lies in not possessing anything. Each moment presents what\n  happens. All I know about method is that when I am not working I some-\n  times think I know something, but when I am working it is quite clear\n  that I know nothing.

There is a dense array of\ntechniques, neatly laid out. The ten pieces (not counting the short verse preamble and coda) alternate\nmodes: prose and verse. Individual pieces employ specific formal devices, such as quotation marks,\nparentheses, truncated sentences, etc.\n\n\n         A blunt, seemingly inescapable verse preamble opens the book:\n\n\n                   Prove to me now that you have finally undermined\n                   your heroes .... Now  become\n\n                   the person in your life. Start writing autobiography.\n\n\nThis seems quintessentially direct, but the beginning of the sequence proper would dispel any\ncertainty a reader had as to Watten's relation to 'autobiography.' 'Statistics' begins:\n\nThere is no language but 'reconstructed' imaged parentheses back into person 'emphasizing constant' explanation 'the\ncurrent to run both ways.'\n\nHere, person and language are in a constant state of reciprocal definition. The existence of words is\ndenied ('there is no language'), then they are given a secondary existence ('reconstructed'), then this is\nqualified (put into 'parentheses'). The primary state is some sort of null point, which then becomes\nlanguage, which then becomes writing, which then approximates person. But each step along this\npath is more of an erosion than a transformation:\n\n'It' makes itself 'by definition' into 'word,' missing the point 'writing,' wanting as 'further' point 'a persona' clearly named.\n\n\n\n  Both Steve Benson's discussion of Kathy Acker and Bob Perelman's review of Barrett Watten are excerpted from booklets\ndocumenting the writers-in-residence program at (and available from) 8o Langton Street (San Francisco, CA 94103). of\nrelated interest, and recommended to our readers, is the 'Talks' issue of Hills magazine (Nos. 6\/7; $5 from 36 Clyde Street,\nSan Francisco, CA 94107). Edited by Perelman, the issue features talks by Bill Berkson, David Bromige, Watten, Benson,\nWilliam Graves, Warren Sonbert, Douglas Woolf, Michael Davidson, Fanny Howe, Ron Silliman, and the editor.\n\n\nThe least questioned term in this progression is writing:\n\n\nThose 'automatons' exist who have by 'progress into the ground' lost use of 'the raised surface' of writing. Circumstances\nof this writing assume 'a recording' will disappear, that 'self' cannot be identified as 'preoccupation with voice' or 'replaced\nwith words.'\n\nIf this is autobiography, it is the story of writing writing itself. Although the piece began with words\nfrom my talk, 'The First Person,' the one word not found here is 'I,' which incorporates, or cancels\nout, or solidifies the tensions between self and language. Watten clearly wants those tensions\nexternalized.\n\n         The quotation marks which pepper the writing heighten this tension. They function in a\nnumber of ways, all of which complicate the soup. First, they are a distancing device, occurring\nsomewhat at random. They also add distance as ironic qualification, implying the antonym of the\nword they bracket, as when someone says: Thanks for the 'help.' They also imply that the words are\nquoted from someone. But, given the fact that every sentence here questions the linkage between\nperson and language, quoting somebody seems like a dubious enterprise.\n\nSimultaneously with techniques of distancing, there is a strong, complex commitment on Watten's\npart toward what is being said. One of the clearest instances is in the third piece, 'Prison Life.' The\nprose here is inundated with parentheses, but I'll first quote part of it omitting them:\n\nThus he became a grammarian, drowning individuals in streaks of diagonal whites, arranging accidental happenstance 'any-\nwhich-way.'... And as he man-handles these pre-ordained pages the lines of print curved and seemed to crawl ... as if masses\nof 'worker' ants were invading a sugar bowl in his hands ... Their white masks to be shattered by various streams of their\ndiscomfort...an inch-by-inch thrash of language ... \u2018his' entire interest in sound was in theoretical fact losing the effect of\ndirecting events to the 'desired' 'reading'...He sees now history not through interpretation but death.\n\nThe gist is clear: history is violent and cannot be viewed with detachment. Becoming a grammarian\nmay initially smack of Joycean aloofness (the artist, invisible behind his work, indifferent, paring his\nnails), but here the artist, his materials, and his art are all part of the convulsive flux. History cannot\nbe aestheticized, nor can a desired reading be achieved.\n\n         And, in the actual fact of the text, the parentheses obliterate any notion of what a desired\nreading could possibly be. I detect a fierce glee on Watten\u2019s part on how many different\nmonkeywrenches he can throw into his syntactic machine:\n\nEach use (cement) of isolation (never turning) studies of same (clothesline) (laid-back posture) (against facts as such) was an\ninch-by-inch thrash (divided into virus blocks) of language (inverted subject, moving from accretion of names) (lights on\nlamps) features foreknowledge (without absolute) the point (to lack, or be without) disclosure separates (one makes two, in\n\n\na voice) brought down (deformities sinister) against itself (left to record) (no buildings left intact) fighting fire (separation of\nchurch and state) with fire (number).\n\nEach parenthesis can be construed as explanation or metaphorical extension, but the overall effect is\nchasms rather than bridges. The reader is asked to become a grammarian and is brought up against\nthe limits of single-sense syntax. Watten is making sure the lines of print will 'curve and seem to\ncrawl.'\n\n         The effect is speedy, funny, hysterical, but not random. This is an important point to make,\nand it extends to the whole book. What makes 1-10 compelling and not merely a neat toying with\ngrammar? The answer lies in the way Watten has been able to blend statement with its antithesis, to\ntruncate or distort it without destroying it completely, so that the reader gets both the statement and\nthe tensions and entropy that stalemate it. in 'Prison Life,' to read that history means people suffer\nand that the artist and his art are not immune, we get treated in the parentheses to metaphor,\ninterruption, snide Califomia-isms ('laid-back posture'), twisted quotes from Olson ('against facts as\nsuch'), dictionary language ('to lack, or be without'), civics subjects ('separation of church and state'),\netc., \u2014 none of which, finally, is irrelevant to the (huge) problem under attack.\n\n         Watten also writes in less overtly problematic modes. In 'Non-Events' the surface is lively\nand immediate, and often quite funny:\n\n                           Thousands of post-war pink lampshades\n\n                                    bear emblems of avant-garde design.\n\n                                    The captains of geological strata\n\n                           are nailed to the fragile picture show.\n\n                           inside the arena tension drips from aura\n\n                                    of cinematic trees. Infantile rage\n\noverpowers the eyeless specialists' church.\n\n                           Fair-weather mirages erase machine-made books.\n\nThe texture is non-stop declarative sentence. They're not long, but what these sentences declare is\ncomplicated. And each sentence in the 25 similar stanzas seems to be trying to say the same thing,\nwhich is: a kind of hologram-like satiric scatter of the present tense, the world we live in. It's a\nlandscape of dislocated industry, widely diffused political repression, and mass media sludge peppered\nwith various jargons.\n\n         The vocabulary is involved with several areas: the physical scene (\u2018machine-made books\u2019\n\u2018post-war pink lampshades\u2019); institutions (churches, the media); branches of knowledge; political\njargon ('the captains of...'); psychology ('infantile rage' 'tension'); art ('picture show' 'opening lines'\n'narrative'). Each sentence mixes at least two of these areas in an effective intuitive way.\n\n\n          This puts pressure on the individual words. They then react in either of two ways.\nSometimes they seem specifically referential in a quick, laconic way:\n\nStraight-laced\n\n                            subterranean pavilions replace original talent\n                                     killed in car accident\n\nequalling, for me, James Dean vs. the Moscone convention center. Or, the\nwords become densely opaque:\n\n                            Hard-core iron cracks the perma-frost\n\n                            table-land with vertical plumb-line of radio.\n\nDegrees of hermeticism will vary from reader to reader, but the general mechanism is clear. It's as if\nthe words within the sentence are on separate tracks and can move toward or away from the reader.\nThe end of the poem confirms this notion: 'The manual is rewritten one word at a time.'\n\n          The sentences are mostly 6-12 words long; the grammatical order is usually\nsubject\/predicate; line breaks seem more for visual neatness than aural scoring. At its most intense,\nthis monochromatic declarative emphasis resolves to statement-statement-statement. So one accepts\nthese sentences almost effortlessly. Then one has to deal with the war of words going on inside:\n\n                            Eye-opening narrative purifies throwbacks\n                            pining for arcane illumination. Agitated\n                            scrabble self-destructs its matrix.\n\n                            Dream flux breaks down to a priori slogans.\n\nSuch sentences stretch normative grammar, but far from effecting its overthrow, they actually depend\non it. The opening of the fifth piece, 'Real Estate' typifies Warren's position: 'The drillground\nendures to revise the worst effects of former studies' monstrous parade.' I read 'grammar' into 'the\ndrillground.'\n\n          In 'Non-Events' each sentence is a replica in miniature of the whole poem. In other parts of\n1-10 a contrary strategy is used, with none of the sentences saying what the piece as a whole says. In\n'Position,' the fourth piece, rather than being hyper-ventilated, the sentences seem truncated,\nincomplete, self-frustrating. They depend on each other for completion: 'Each is a unit,\/ and all else.'\nBut more emphasis is placed on their individual incompletion: 'Lies,\/\/ Extension of screen.\nGrammar\/ signifies refusal\/ to correspond\/ Multiple cracks\/ spread out. A sequence of\/ obstacles\nblocks\/ the memory of facts.'\n\n\n          A conventionally lyric sentence such as 'Branches touch cloud\/\/ At the bottom of the well' is\nimmediately countered by 'Print monitors illusion of depth.' What seems to be aimed at here is \u2018A\nmethod to invent disbelief.' These sentences refuse, emphatically, to allow anything to be read into\nthem. The reader is instead directly to focus on the gaps in between: 'The skeleton at\/\/ The border\ninstructs. Spread\/ of the fingers\/ between keys. Telephone poles\/ standing on disputed ground.'\n\n          This movement away from embodiment of statement within the sentence reaches its extreme\nin the sixth and seventh pieces, 'Silence' and 'Exposure.' From 'Silence':\n\n                                      The given sight\n                                      none will he have.\n\n                             A picture in part of, to make\n                             then destroy it. The sun shines\n                             directly into eyes'\n                             decline, do not see. Disguised\n                             as what it did\n\n                                      And meant no noise.\n\nAt first glance, 'Exposure' completes the systole. The sentences are truncated, closed. What starts as\nstatement can go nowhere:\n\nThe crystallization of ground into. Retreating selection and drift. A man standing on a column under shadow of. Accidents\nof electrostatic charge ... Concentric flights lead to.\n\nBut this piece also contains a number of charged, conflicted autobiographical statements: 'I'm in this\nright now.\u2019 \u2018Normal timespan leaves no time for.' \u2018Autocritique absorbed in length of days.\u2019 \u2018Being a\nself-portrait.' This is a funny mix of acceptance and refusal of being identified as the agent doing the\nwriting; plus a bit of the (very self-preoccupied) Horatian sentiment of 'ars longa; vita brevis'\n(Art:long;life:short).\n\n          On one level, Watten jealously guards his writing from his 'self.' Up to this point in the\nbook there has been no surface narrative of daily life, description of the author's state of mind, etc.\nBut, on the other hand, even a work like 'Exposure' can be read as being intensely autobiographical.\nThe way this works is hinted at in one of its sentences: 'By enhancing neutrality of sound betrays an\nopposite that is recognition of itself.' I would take 'itself' to be the writing and 'an opposite' to be the\nself. Near the end of the piece this tension becomes explicit:\n\nExtensions persist to unbroken chain, gradually supplanting any mistakes. Continue to what crudely I aped. Meaningless,\nuninteresting, useless boxes .. Because I am not talking in small, agitated jerks. (But, of course, he is) Oblong reflectors\ntwist the shapes. Separate positions capable of voice.\n\n\nIn the penultimate sentence, both the 'reflectors' and the 'shapes' can be read as either the author or\nthe sentences.\n\n         It may seem odd at first, but there is an analogy between Watten's position here and that of\nShelley, who was echoing (and modifying) the ancient theory of writing as inspiration when he said:\n\nThe poet and the man are two different natures; though they exist together they may be unconscious of each other, and\nincapable of deciding upon each other's powers and efforts by any reflex act. \u2014 quoted in M.H. Abrams, The Mirror and\nthe Lamp\n\nIt's an analogy, not an identity, because Watten rejects, vehemently, the notion of 'the poet.' Or,\nmore precisely, the abyss of glamorization one can fall into while apostrophizing said being. In 1-10\nthe agent doing the writing is said to be impersonal ('Separate positions capable of voice') and is\nusually identified as 'the writing' itself, or 'it.' This terminology, suggesting the writing as self-\ngenerating, also suggests that Coleridge with his notion of the imagination as an organic, teleological\nprocess, is the more closely related ancestor here. But the general sense that the person is not the one\ndoing the writing remains strong and is congruent to part of the Romantic aesthetic.\n\n         This creates conflicts, as Watten very consciously espouses the Modernist aesthetic, with its\npush toward scientific knowledge of the structures of writing, and its concomitant assumption that\nthe writer should know what he or she is doing, and do it, straightforwardly. 1-10 is a Modernist\ntitle, implying the completion of some basic investigation. The highly systematic approach to the\nsentence and the way the techniques are separated out confirm this. The conflict, as I've been\npointing out, takes place within the sentence.\n\n         And it is the basic pulse of the book. Since Watten does not use much narrative or discursive\nargument, the rhythm becomes of reiteration of sentences. (Though there are more or less tenuous,\ncomplex connections between sentences.) The effect is that each sentence is a hit, or resolution of the\nprimary tension which has to be arrived at over and over. To quote from the book: 'The train\nceaselessly reinvents the station.'\n\n         In the eighth piece, 'Mimesis,' the surface is overloaded rather than undercut, a return to the\nimpulse of 'Non-Events.' The writing is now capable of incorporating (or reinventing) the physical\nworld:\n\n\n                   Assemble blocks, ramps, nets, prop them up with broken\n\n                            Equipment, an elastic language one could translate\n\n                   Into good photos of a table standing upright on level ground\n                            Color, shape, height, size, are revised and corrected\n\n\n                              'Is it speakable?\u2019 ...\n\n\nAt the end of the poem, there is a hint of a discussion of the effect this writing has on the body,\nthough this is followed by a gesture of disavowal:\n\n\n                     Once learned thought vanishes ...... inventing address\n\n                     Or its apparition if exhausted, a stream of uniform elements\n\n                               Could be this coherent sentence, ascending spinal column\n\n                     Searching out retinal charge, opaque black paper, solar fruit\n\n                               A priori contraries in serial jumps from one to ten\n\n                     Could hide this little man, having no intention to be useful...\n\n\nThis tentative approach to the physicality of poetry can be seen in the last poem, 'Radio,' which\nbegins: 'Conviction fills the body\/ The presence of dead souls\/ flute-like at the base of the ear.' But\ntoward the end, poetry is disembodied, and the mechanical aspects of intelligence are seized on: 'The\nmachine never tires.\/ Edges of stations start to come in.'\n\n         I'll close with some quotes from 'Protection,' the penultimate piece. It's the most relaxed\npiece in the book, even a bit narrative at times. It can be read, in places, as talking about Watten's\nfeeling for the process of writing:\n\nHe works rapidly, and soon a beautiful city is built in seven successive layers. The wilderness turns up again, and you turn\naway... He had always wanted to be a landscape painter. Time seen as image is time lost to sight. One is left with a trowel\nand a lot of empty flowerpots. Nothing is more common than for the meaning of a word to change, for the population to\nchange place. Even as the eye is moving across the page. There is no 'state of mind,' he is firmly convinced. Everything in\nthe world is present to him then . There was desire piling up shapes so quickly it got in the way.\n\nIt's getting too close to home, time to change voices. Here he ascribes meaning to a meaningless shape. Stones of the lake\nwith two names. Language makes a home, not the other way around.\n"},{"uid":"BobPerelman_A24_1979","author":"Bob Perelman","shortTitle":"\"A\"-24","title":"Bob Perelman | \"A\"-24 | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn8\/pictures\/006.html","text":"\n\n\u201dA\u201d-24\n\nThe difficulties \u201dA\u201d-'24 imposes on its performers and audience are enor-\nmous. They stem directly from Zukofsky\u2019s poetics: \"An integral \/ Lower\nlimit speech \/ Upper limit music.\u201d The words function two ways at once:\nas phonemes, and as syntax, meaning, story.\n\n     The structure of the piece insists on language\u2019s double ply.\nThere\u2019s music playing, Handel\u2019s \u00a3Bach, Z\u2019s expected choice, wd have been\ntoo \u2019good\u2019, too complicated & distracting?^ , sturdy, straight-forward\nrhythm, clear never quite to the point of obviousness, the vertical\narchitecture (harmonies) and the horizontal (melody, counterpoint)\nalways hearable. 4 voices (Thought, Drama, Story, Poem) are scored\ninto this steady pulse as precisely as if the piece were a quintet for\nstrings and keyboard. Phonetically, the words are treated as music.\n\n     But, quoting Act I, Scene I, \"Blest \/ Infinite things\/ So many\/\nWhich confuse imagination \/ Thru its weakness \/ To the ear \/ Noises. \/ Or\nharmony \/ Delights \/ Men to madness \/ \u201d (Spinoza), the syntactic side gets\nstretched. It\u2019s often difficult to speak the meanings vividly due to\nthe number of rests scored into each vocal line. And when the musical\nrhythm is quick enough to allow the line to near speech, the listener\nhas the problem of the vertical overlay of the other 3 voices. [Occa-\nsionally (end of first scene) different voices splice without much over-\nlay to sound one multi-syntactic phrase\/sentence (a bit like Webern),\nbut it\u2019s aa exception. Not the point of the piece\/]\n\n\n     The theory of language approaching music should allow for an\napproachable \u2019verbal harmony\u2019. But the analogy misleads. Discounting\nexternals (timbre, octave spacing, etc.) music (standard Western for\nthe moment, the kind Z seemed mainly concerned with) works with a voca-\nbulary of 12 tones, units. English uses, say, 300 phonemes, and they\naren\u2019t the point, but rather the 500,000 words that are elusively pinned\nto them. Not to mention syntax\/sentences.\n\n     Language doesn\u2019t occur in time the way music does. Music is\nstrictly sequence, absolutely dependent on time. Language merely uses\ntime to embody itself in a string of phonemes, the meaning occurring\nboth during the sounds, and after they have vanished. In music, a ver-\ntical cross-section is unambiguous at every point. The units are\ninstantly \u2019transparent\u2019, so to speak. A g sounds like a g, always, thus\nallowing Bach to write such complicated single voices and put as many as\n6 of them together into such exciting and \u2019inevitable\u2019 harmonic order,\nan ability Zukofsky loved him for.\n\n     But language doesn\u2019t work that way. A phoneme doesn\u2019t sound like\na word, a verb won\u2019t necessarily reveal itself as such until some, or\nmany, more phonemes have sounded. Phonemes, the units of \u2019verbal music\u2019\naren\u2019t transparent, can\u2019t be superimposed without ambiguity. What the\near tends to do on first hearing \u201dA\u201d-24 is switch rapidly from voice to\nvoice. The quality of all 4 modes of Zukofsky\u2019s writing is immediately\nand ubiquitously apparent, his \u2019sincerity\u2019 [see \u201dAn Objective\u201d, II], his\ncare in choosing and joining words.\n\n     But to fully appreciate the rhymes, harmonies, congruences takes\nrepeated hearings, reading each part separately, joining them to their\noriginal contexts. \u201dA\u201d-24 echoes minutely and vastly. There are imme-\ndiately hearable phonetic rhymes, syntactic rhymes (e,g. pp. 167-8,\nThought: \u201din case he should attempt an escape\u201d; Drama: \u2019\u2019but now I go\u201d;\nPoem: \u2019\u2019not many of us will get out of it alive.\u201d), but many more echoes,\nrepetitions, allusions that are widely separated. The most compelling\ncongruences are the largest. In the last section, Fugues: Thought:\nHenry Adams\u2019 life\/writing; Story: a particular instance of Z\u2019s life\/\nwriting a single sentence; Drama: Z\u2019s dramatization of himself as a\nyoung man; Poem: nature as creator\/created. Plus Adams\u2019 marriage\/ Z\u2019s\nmarriage\/ the Son\u2019s romance with the Girl, etc., etc., etc.\n\n     Ultimately, hearing \u201dA\u201d-24 will lead to the totality of Zukofsky\u2019s\nwork. As he said, a poet writes one work all his life. \"A\u201d-24 really\nis \u2019\u2019Celia\u2019s L.Z. Masque,\u201d a most accurate portrait of him. [Not sure,\nby the way, how much of the scoring and\/or text selection is hers\/his.J\n\n     Clearly, everybody hears all the sound of the piece. But Zukofsky\nis trying to hook up the physical instantaneous unconscious undistorta-\nble act of hearing with the fullest possible range of thought (all of a\nlife). Performing and hearing \u201dA\u201d-24 presupposes a thorough knowledge\nof Z\u2019s work, an ecstatically dilated time sense in which every syllable\n\n\ncontinues sounding until they all have resolved each other, and an eter-\nnity in which the whole work, is present in any of its sounds.

One must admit that for the most part these\n    questions, too, have been elaborated only episodically and fragmentarily.\n    A technique which today receives even less consideration is that of elliptical\n    perception, by which the listener fills in (again on all linguistic levels) what-\n    ever had been omitted by him as listener. We have also failed to appreciate\n    properly the subjectivism of the hearer who fills in the elliptic gaps cre-\n    atively.\u00b9\n\n\nThe listener tends to \u201cfill in\u201d or weave into any elliptical speech act certain\nelements of his or her internal experience. This new formulation, at that\npoint existing only within, as Jakobson and Pomorska term it, \u201cthe sub-\njectivism\u201d of the listener, functions momentarily as a \u201ctransitional object\u201d\nor area of potential space between the listener and the speaker (I will discuss\nin detail the psychoanalytic concept of the \u201ctransitional object\u201d and its appli-\ncation to contemporary poetry in section 2).\n\n     The effect of the \u201caural ellipsis\u201d in poetry allows that, at certain points,\nthe poem may exist within an indeterminate site of significant verbal experi-\nence that is simultaneously physical and mental, objective and subjective,\nheard aloud and read silently, emanating from a specific self yet also from a\nnonspecific site of identity, coming toward comprehensibility and disinte-\ngrating into incoherence. This analysis or representation, we may find on\nclose examination, frequently corresponds to specific moments of everyday\nexperience far more accurately than the fictions of perception proffered un-\nder official categories of self\/identity determination and factual authentica-\ntion. Another function of the aural ellipsis in poetry may be to manifest and\nmodel an emerging paradigm shift in the combining and layering of lan-\nguages as the world moves rapidly toward global forms of communication.\nIt is possible that the emergence of the \u201caural ellipsis\u201d in poetry presages\nthe coming of ever more widely shared forms of language by subliminally\nteaching us how to intuitively apprehend at least the rough outlines of\nmeanings, both manifest and latent, of verbal constructs, by means of de-\ntecting, tracking and decoding their rhythmic presentations alone. This may\nbe achieved in part by further developing, in listening to contemporary po-\netry, the everyday practice of evaluating the connotations of utterances by\nmeans of sensing the speaker\u2019s speech rhythms, whether halting, uneven or\ntonally nuanced, as, for example, with irony, humor, or sarcasm.\n\n     When reading or listening to the words of a poem with an open form\nof attention, it does appear possible, at times, for the reader to decipher\nsubliminal levels of significance that follow latent streams running appar-\nently parallel to the explicit content, or to sound out encoded message con-\ntent by tracking meanings primarily through the apprehension of patterns\nof rhythms and sounds. This effect seems particularly palpable in such\nworks as the avant-garde classic Trilce by C\u00e9sar Vallejo:\n\n    999 CALORIES.\n\n    Rumbbb . . .

But no.\n\n    Who like what\u2019s going neither more nor less.\n\n    Who like the happy medium.\u00b2\n\nA clear concern with related issues can be found in as early an American\npoet as Emily Dickinson:\n\n\n    I felt a Cleaving in my Mind\u2014\n\n    As if my Brain had split\u2014\n\n    I tried to match it\u2014Seam by Seam\u2014\n\n    But could not make them fit.\n\n    The thought behind, I strove to join\n\n    Unto the thought before\u2014\n\n    But Sequence ravelled out of Sound\n\n    Like Balls\u2014upon a Floor.\u00b2 \u00b3\n\n    My earliest awareness of the existence of the aural ellipsis came in read-\ning, for the first time in the middle to late 1960s, certain works of such\npoets as Jackson Mac Low, Robert Greeley, Bernadette Mayer, John Ash-\nbery, and Clark Coolidge, as well as the writing and early performance\nworks of Vito Acconci, the essays and \u201cnonsite\u201d sculptures of Robert\nSmithson, and the films of Michelangelo Antonioni and Jean-Luc Godard.\nIn the key early works of all of these artists great attention is paid to formal\nelements that effectively permit these works to be experienced by the reader\nor viewer as \u201cholding environments\u201d (a term I discuss below), a possibility\ngreatly enhanced by the use of found and invented forms of language and\ninnovative conceptions of the relationships among perception, language,\nand reality. In contrast, these works are not so improvisatory as to lack\nsignificant content, unity, and structure. The relationship or balance be-\ntween elements of recognizable content and structure and those of semantic\nand structural innovation create good conditions for the presence of the\naural ellipsis. Uses of abstract-expressionist, surrealist, and other innovative\ntechniques foregrounding the juxtaposition of words and images, paradox,\nambiguity, and enigma, encourage readers or viewers to bring into aware-\nness and project their own experiences, conscious and unconscious, onto\nthe works, enhancing their usefulness as transitional objects.\n\n\n2\n\n\nIn a much discussed review of John Ashbery\u2019s Selected Poems published in\n\n\nSulfur in 1987, Sven Birkerts wrote: \u201cJohn Ashbery\u2019s Selected Poems: that for-\nlorn codex, garden of branching paths, termite tree of the late Millennium\n. . . The assignment was to review it, and I find I cannot. To review is to\nhave read and to be looking back. I have read at, toward, near, but never\nwith that cinching tug of understanding. I have moved my eyes and felt the\nslow dispersion of my sense of self. I have been flung back into the bore-\ndom and rage of childhood, when the whole world seemed to rear up\nagainst me, not to be had or understood.\u201d\u2074 What interests me in this is not\nonly Birkerts\u2019s evident tone-deafness to Ashbery\u2019s remarkable poetic music,\nbut also the fact that Birkerts frequently has many valuable insights to offer\nand that there may be one buried in this otherwise dismissive diatribe. Note\nthat Birkerts describes with great feeling, and some poetic evocativeness,\n\n\nthe experience of being transported back into childhood. He is perhaps un-\nconsciously alluding here to the child\u2019s whole ambivalent experience around\nsymbiosis, the necessary early psychological stage of merging with maternal\nand paternal figures that can introduce (among many other crucial experi-\nences) feelings of helplessness and depression. He quotes the following pas-\nsage of one of Ashbery\u2019s poems, \u201cWe Hesitate\u201d:\n\n    Once they come home there is no cursing.\n\n    Fires disturb the evening. No one can hear the story\n\n    Or sometimes people just forget\n\n    . . . Like a child.\n\nBirkerts goes on to say \u201cI could go over this a hundred times and it would\nmean nothing more that it does on a first reading\u201d (146).\n\n     Since I have poor Birkerts here involuntarily on a figurative psychoana-\nlytic couch, I might speculate that he is in a state of \u201cresistance.\u201d If this\nconjecture is correct, the resistance probably is connected with the kind of\nanxiety Birkerts described earlier as the \u201cslow dispersion of my sense of\nself.\u201d In psychoanalysis we observe that the reason that people frequently\n\u201cresist\u201d change in living, and in analysis, is that it can be painful to revive\nthe memories that must be elicited and connected with on a feeling level if\none is to ultimately understand the past and move on. Why \u201cdispersion . . .\nof self\u201d? Because this is exactly the feeling one has in a state of merging.\nDoes the Ashbery text in fact encourage an experience of merging? I feel\nthat it does. I might even agree with Birkerts that, in a certain important\npsychological sense, \u201cAshbery\u2019s poetry works backward along the evolution-\nary spiral, undoing\u201d (Birkerts, 148). Where I completely disagree with Birk-\nerts is when he asserts that \u201cthis is an enterprise that repudiates sense and\nmocks our faith in the sufficiency of our language structures\u201d (148).\n\n     Birkerts\u2019s failure to follow up his own carefully documented responses\nto Ashbery\u2019s poetry to a point where he might have connected with it more\nfully can be taken as an exemplary case of a kind of flight from what I\nbelieve to be a paradigm shift not only in the style of much valuable poetry\nbeing written today, but also in its functions on many planes\u2014social, psy-\nchological, linguistic, philosophical, artistic, and cultural. Apparently, what\nBirkerts wants from his experience of contemporary poetry is the traditional\ncritical opportunity to use close intellectual reading of poetry as a way of\ninterpreting it and ultimately finding that most satisfying of rational experi-\nences, closure. This is primarily an intellectual process. But much effective\ncreative work today, particularly in the field of poetry, cannot be appreci-\nated and enjoyed by reorganizing it conceptually. Perhaps this is because\nmany, if not most, of the innovative artists and poets of our time are less\ninterested in their works being interpreted as representing or reflecting spe-\ncific ideas and ideologies, than in having their art work provide something\nanalogous to what the British psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott called a \u201chold-\ning environment,\u201d a context that makes available to poets and other artists\n\n\nand to their readers, listeners or viewers freely juxtaposed modes of paying\nclose attention to external and internal experience. This opening or freeing\nof forms of focusing in turn makes possible an intensified collaborative shar-\ning (between a poet and listeners at a reading, for example) in the effort of\norganizing otherwise anomalous, disparate and incommunicable percep-\ntions into patterns of meaning that can be further articulated, refined, and\nbetter understood, in an ongoing process. To understand what Winnicott\nmeant by a holding environment we must first examine his concept of the\n\u201ctransitional object\u201d:\n\n    I have introduced the terms \u2018transitional objects\u2019 and \u2018transitional phenom-\n    ena\u2019 for designation of the intermediate area of experience, between the\n    thumb and the teddy bear, between the oral eroticism and the true object-\n    relationship, between primary creative activity and projection of what has\n    already been introjected ... By this definition an infant\u2019s babbling and\n    the way in which an older child goes over a repertory of songs and tunes\n    while preparing for sleep come within the intermediate area as transitional\n    phenomena, along with the use made of objects that are not part of the\n    infant\u2019s body yet are not fully recognized as belonging to external reality'.\u2075\n\nNote that Winnicott here includes sounds, both audible and imagined, as\ntransitional objects.\n\n    Winnicott\u2019s discovery of the transitional object resolves, or takes to a\nnew level, an issue in Freudian psychoanalysis that seems to have left Freud\nin an unclear state as to the reasons why art exists. He could only explain it\nas a kind of \u201csublimation\u201d or substitute for the sexual instinct. For him, the\nartist was a neurotic person who felt the need to substitute fantasies for\nreality. Winnicott\u2019s understanding of what he termed \u201ctransitional objects\u201d\ncomes out of his work as a pediatrician as much as his work as a psychoana-\nlyst, as well as from his participation in the work of a school of psychoana-\nlysts known as the \u201cobject relations\u201d school, which includes Melanie Klein,\nW. R. D. Fairbairn, and Harry' Guntrip. In his theoretical work, as well as\nhis technical recommendations to child psychoanalysts, Winnicott greatly\nfurthers our understanding of the continuity between the needs of the child\nand the needs of the adult in creating, as he called them, \u201cillusions.\u201d A sense\nof how to apprehend this continuity is exactly what is missing in Birkerts\u2019s\nunderstanding of Ashber\/s poetry. Winnicott\u2019s insights not only provide\nus with a better understanding of the healthy uses of artistic products but\nalso the important and necessary function of art in creating holding envi-\nronments and \u201ctransitional objects\u201d for life long use. Winnicott says of the\ntransitional object (his emphasis): \u201c0\/the transitional object it can be said\nthat it is a matter of agreement between us and the baby that we will never ask\nthe question: \u2018Did you conceive of this or was it presented to you jrom without?'\u00b9\nThe important point is that no decision on this point is expected. The question is\nnot to be formulated\u201d (Winnicott, 12). This quality of the indefinite origin of\nthe transitional object for the infant is reflected in die psychological and\n\n\naesthetic functions of indeterminacy and ambiguity in the art object or in\nthe poem that is appreciated and enjoyed by die adult. Winnicott also\nstates: \u201cIt is assumed here that the task of reality-acceptance is never com-\npleted, that no human is free from the strain of relating inner and outer\nreality, and that relief from this strain is provided by an intermediate area\nof experience . . . which is not challenged (arts, religion, etc.). This inter-\nmediate area is in direct continuity with the play area of the child who is\n\u2018lost\u2019 in play\u201d (13). When Winnicott speaks of an \u201cintermediate area\u201d or a\n\u201cthird area,\u201d what he is speaking about is an area that is neither strictly\nsubjective or objective: \u201cThe place where cultural experience is located is\nthe potential space between the individual and the environment (originally\nthe object). The same can be said of playing. Cultural experience begins\nwith creative living first manifested in play\u201d (100). The discovery of the\ntransitional object revealed some of the key social and psychological func-\ntions of the contemporary art object in extending psychological develop-\nment throughout life.\n\n    For Winnicott, the experience he calls holding is one provided for an\ninfant by a \u201cgood enough\u201d parental \u201cfacilitating environment.\u201d During this\ntime the infant is gradually introduced into reality or the \u201cobjective\u201d world\nby means of die parents allowing for the infant\u2019s, and later the child\u2019s, total\ndependence, gradually shifting into partial dependence, and finally indepen-\ndence. For the child to develop this independence the parental figures must\nbe capable, however, of tolerating the infant\u2019s need for feeling a degree of\nomnipotence, and to permit and empathize with die need on the part of\nthe infant and later the child, for the use of \u201cmagical\u201d transitional objects as\nan intermediate protection and support during the transition from the\nmerged, omnipotent state, to die more vulnerable and self-reliant indepen-\ndent state. The transitional object facilitates a means by which the child and\nthe parent can paradoxically (and often unconsciously) hold on to each\nother and let go of each other at the same time. Similarly, the contemporary\npoem that functions as a mode of providing a holding environment makes\nit possible for the reader to imaginatively hold on to the poem and to let\ngo of it at the same time, thereby enhancing the listener\u2019s associative filling-\nin of elliptical gaps (the aural ellipsis).\n\n    Winnicott\u2019s application of his discovery of the transitional object identi-\nfies, names, and authenticates an area of human experience that is simultane-\nously physical and mental and not exclusively either, and that does not rely\non any notion of \u201cspirit,\u201d as does, for example, the concept of the \u201ctalis-\nman.\u201d The need for knowledge, concepts, and principles to enunciate the\nintersections or boundaries among language, consciousness, objects, and\nother less apprehensible and specifiable areas of experience has long been\nstruggled with in philosophy and phenomenology by such figures as Plato,\nPascal, Hegel, Kant, Moore, Wittgenstein, Husserl, and others. Aspects of\nthe philosophical and literary theories of Walter Benjamin seem to me com-\nplementary to Winnicott\u2019s ideas; in particular, his concept of the \u201caura\u201d and\n\n\nhis use of the Paris arcades as physical evidence for his theories about society\nform important parallels. Benjamin seemed very concerned about finding\ncorrelatives in the physical world, types of evidence, for his literary theories.\nAlthough there is not sufficient space in this context to explore this at\nlength, a few citations from Benjamin might be enough to suggest a usefill\nconnection between the relatively recent work of this important critical the-\norist and the important \u201cobject relations\u201d psychoanalytic theorist, Winni-\ncott, in specifying an area of poetics that in the past could only be ade-\nquately encompassed by employing concepts more closely related to\nreligion and mysticism.\n\n     In discussing the role of architecture in the life of the private citizen\nunder Louis-Phillipe, Benjamin writes: \u201cThe private citizen who in the of-\nfice took reality into account, required of the interior that it should support\nhim in his illusions . . . From this sprang the phantasmagorias of the inte-\nrior. This represented the universe for the private citizen. In it he assembled\nthe distant in space and time. His drawing-room was a box in the world-\ntheatre . . . The interior was the place of refuge of Art.\u201d\u2076 What interests\nme here is Benjamin\u2019s focus on the fact that die need for illusion by the\n\u201cprivate citizen\u201d had become regularized in relation to the use of everyday\nobjects. He was able to effectively demonstrate this by his explication of the\nrelation of the place of illusion to the functions and forms of everyday decor\nin the eighteenth century. This understanding of the process of psychologi-\ncal transformation of everyday objects of human habitation into a stage set\nfor illusion or play is akin to the way Winnicott understood the human\ntendency to transform sounds, language, and things into psychological envi-\nronments for human transition and growth. Benjamin\u2019s profound insights\ninto the functions of the \u201caura\u201d at times come very close to apprehending\nand characterizing the area of experience that Winnicott later identified and\nnamed \u201cthe transitional object\u201d: \u201c \u2018Perceptibility,\u2019 as Novalis puts it, \u2018is a\nkind of attentiveness.\u2019 The perceptibility he has in mind is none other than\nthat of the aura. Experience of the aura thus rests on the transposition of a\nresponse common in human relationships to the relationship between the\ninanimate or natural object and man. The person we look at, or who feels\nhe is being looked at, looks at us in turn. To perceive the aura of an object\nwe look at means to invest it with the ability to look at us in return\u201d (Benja-\nmin, 148).\n\n     Benjamin\u2019s acute sensitivity to the human propensity to transpose hu-\nman qualities into natural objects by means of attentiveness to their auras is\nuncannily close to Winnicott\u2019s conception of the transitional object. Like\nWinnicott, Benjamin describes the aura as existing in an intermediate state\nwhich is both human and nonhuman, subjective and objective. Benjamin\nattributed to Baudelaire particular insight into this phenomenon, twice\nquoting the following lines from \u201cCorrespondances,\u201d from Fleurs du Mal:\n\u201cMan wends his way through forests of symbols \/ Which look at him with\ntheir familiar glances\u201d (Benjamin, 140, 149).\u2077\n\n\n     Benjamin\u2019s apprehension of the \u201caura\u201d and Winnicott\u2019s elucidation of\nthe \u201ctransitional object\u201d provide contemporary conceptual frameworks for\ngrasping an aspect of human experience that previously was essentially the\nprovince of religion and mysticism. For thousands of years, shamans in\ntribal cultures have been chanting at least partially improvised, frequently\nfragmented, elliptical phrases, often when the shaman was in an altered\nstate, as an important aspect of healing rituals.\u2078 The American Shakers\nwrote over ten thousand spontaneous hymns in the course of a few decades\nof prayer meetings. The use of otherwise meaningless syllables of sound\n(like Om) figures importantly in Buddhism and other religions.\n\n     \u201cThe Spirit is the Conscious Ear\u201d wrote Dickinson (poem 733, p. 359).\nWhile for many, notions of the mystical or spiritual are no longer adequate\nconcepts for evoking certain otherwise unnamable yet powerfully influential\neffects of the sounds of words in poetry, terms like the transitional object or,\nin this context, the aural ellipsis can underline how from birth to death par-\nticular poetic uses of spoken or sung ellliptical language seem to inspire in\nus some needed access to otherwise inaccessible and incommunicable realms\nof experience.\n\n\n3\n\nIn an unguarded moment of reverie I find that I am not only listening to\nthe Debussy Images for piano but I am simultaneously listening for some-\nthing that is further to be heard. I think of Rilke:\n\n    Voices, voices. Listen, my heart, as hitherto only\n\n    saints have listened, so that the mighty call\n\n    lifted them from the earth; but they kept on kneeling,\n\n    these impossible ones, and paid no attention\u2014\n\n    so hard they were listening.\u2079\n\nI encounter this theme frequently in the works of contemporary artists. The\npoet and filmmaker Abigail Child puts it like this:\n\n    Listen! provocatively\n\n    that\u2019s your spirit\n\n    that\u2019s your fucking consciousness.\u00b9\u2070\n\nCharles Bernstein\u2019s poem \u201cSubstance Abuse\u201d contains a passage that focuses\non the key issue of freedom and improvisation in poetic listening. As is\nfrequently the case in his work, the boundaries between critical writing,\npoetics, personal self disclosure, and poetic revelation are blurred and many\nof the issues surrounding what I am terming the aural ellipsis are discussed\nand evoked:\n\n    Nothing tires a vision more than sundry attacks\n\n    in the manner of enclosure. My thoughts toss\n\n\n    trippingly on the tongue\u2014an immense excuse\n\n    for proportion [perforation]. What I am saying\n\n    here will only come out in joinings:\n\n    but to loosen the mind, limber it for\n\n    bounding. What does ear contain\n\n    that norming senses lack? A resolution\n\n    in the air.\u00b9\u00b9\n\nThe stillness within Lynne Dreyer\u2019s call for listening is poignant and reso-\nnant:\n\n    It was the voice. It was the\n\n    voices of people I had known\n\n    before. It was my own voice. I\n\n    wanted to watch you. The\n\n     children are cruel. They find\n    nothing changed. They find\n    silence.\n\n         Yet something increased in\n    sound. You sat down and for\n    the first time in your entire life\n    you listened and heard some-\n    thing that had nothing to do with you.\u00b9\u00b2\n\n     In certain readings of poetry I am hearing something parallel but other-\nwise mysteriously inaccessible, compared to what I am listening to when\nlistening to becomes listening^ I can frequently perceive this effect of aural\nellipsis when the poetic text accommodates itself comfortably to what I\nsense to be the actuality of everyday, nondeliberate thought, or what I call\n\u201caverage thought.\u201d Jakobson writes: \u201cQuite fragmentary in the most relaxed\nthinking, inner language may be only partial even in deliberate cogitation.\n\u2018Sentences,\u2019 says Egger, \u2018may be condensed. These words . . . have full\nmeaning only for the individual who conceives them . . . Synthetic expres-\nsions such as \u2018Wretch\u2014! Another\u2014! Never\u2014!\u2019 are sufficient, even without\nexplanatory context, when we\u2019re talking to ourselves.\u201d\u00b9\u00b3 Everyday, nonpur-\nposive thought weaves its way through memories, assertions, emotions, re-\nflections, observations, generalizations, comparisons, ellisions almost instan-\ntaneously and frequently with very elliptical uses of language.\n\n     Many of the poems of Paul Celan might well illustrate the powerful\npoetic use of the aural ellipsis. In the poem \u201cAnd with the Book from Ta-\nrussa,\u201d which begins with an epigram from Marina Tsvetayeva\u2014\u201cAll poets\nare Jews\u201d\u2014Celan writes:\n\n    . . . Of the woods\n\n    Untrodden, of the\n\n    thought they grew from, as sound\n\n     and half-sound and changed sound and terminal sound, Scythian\n         rhymes . . .\n\n\n      . . into the realm,\n    the widest of\n    realms, into\n    the great internal rhyme\n    beyond\n    the zone of mute nations, into yourself\n    language-scale, word-scale, home-\n    scale of exile.\u00b9\u2074\n\nIt appears that Celan is defining here with great poetic precision what I\nhave been describing as the aural ellipsis and the development of an interna-\ntional language of thought and sound, \u201cthe great internal rhyme \/ beyond \/\nthe zone of mute nations.\u201d With this internal access, words and languages\ncan become a shared \u201czone,\u201d on one accessible scale, where all \u201cexiles\u201d can\ndiscover a common \u201chome.\u201d\n\n      Works of poetry that can be characterized as effective mediums for the\naural ellipsis tend to be works that permit listeners and readers to discover\nand determine many of the structural elements of the poem for themselves,\nradrer than foreground the narrative or didactic elements that provide the\nillusion of purpose, realism, or verisimilitude. There is a distinction that can\nbe made between written works that can be appreciated by means of ordi-\nnary silent reading and those in which each word should be heard read\naloud or individually sounded out aloud in the mind. With the latter works\nreaders are encouraged to experience the poem by sounding it out internally\nin a process of concentrated, yet freely imaginative listening and reading\nrather than only hearing it as something closer to grammatically conven-\ntional speech that can be fully explicated. It is in this sense that the aural\/\noral ellipsis encourages listening to poetry as a holding environment within\nwhich the gaps among thought, language, and sensory experience must be\nbridged by the listener. Rather than only being asked to observe and com-\nprehend a pattern of thinking, here listeners and readers, by means of a\nprocess of close, but freely imaginative, listening, are encouraged to actively\nparticipate in it.\n\n     Certainly, of all the poetry written today, Jackson Mac Low\u2019s work best\nexemplifies, particularly in its consistency of perspective and literary innova-\ntion, the presence of the aural ellipsis. My first readings of the poems from\nThe Pronouns, in 1966-1967, provided my earliest definitive experience of\npoems wherein tire rhythmical, aural, and visual functions of words within\nthe poem were equivalent in significance and aesthetic impact to any literal\nmeanings those words might have had at the time of reading them. This\nequivalence was extended to tire rhythmic structure of the lines and to the\nmovements of the eyes in rhythmically reading the words on the page. I felt\nthat I was recognizing here directly that there was a gap or aporia in the\nsenses among hearing (which includes mental, imagined hearing as much as\nactual physical hearing), seeing, and touching in everyday life. Here, coordi-\nnated or combined sensory experiences replace perceptions that are simply\n\n\ndisparate or discrete. The precision of this effect seems to have at least\npartly resulted from Mac Low\u2019s system of recycling his literary source mate-\nrial, which involves the use of randomizing methods, techniques that he has\nbeen evolving and experimenting with throughout his career, and master-\nfully employs in such recent books of poems as Bloomsday.\u00b9\u2075\n\n     In November 1967 I learned that Mac Low had extended this system\nof equivalences into the sphere of political action, when I met him for the\nfirst time at a demonstration sponsored by the War Resisters League at the\nWhitehall Street Induction Center. I found an equivalence between the way\nMac Low accentuated the transformation of identity in both the subjective\nand objective realms, in this case, the poetic and the political. In The Pro-\nnouns the pronoun itself, as a part of language, becomes an allegorical ele-\nment of the sociopolitical dynamics of the dances. Mac Low has to date\ncontinued to be intensely interested in the performance aspect of his poetry,\na fact made abundantly clear in his innumerable poetic and music perfor-\nmances that have remained a crucial aspect in the development of his poetic\nwork for over forty years.\u00b9\u2076 As he put it in his \u201cReflections on the Occasion\nof the DANCE SCOPE issue\u201d (dated 8\/29\/74): \u201cSince 1954 I have made many\npieces\u2014simultaneities for voices &\/or instruments, poems, plays, musical\nworks\u2014which call for active creative collaboration of performers and\/or au-\ndience. My reasons for liking this type of composition has not changed\nmuch since I wrote the statement . . . \u2018An \u201canarchist\u201d does not believe, as\nsome have wrongly put it, in social chaos. He or she believes in a society\nwhere there is no frozen power structure, where all persons may make sig-\nnificant initiatory choices in matters affecting their own lives. In such a\nsociety coercion is at a minimum & lethal violence is practically nonexis-\ntent.\u2019 \u201d\u00b9\u2077\n\n    The aural ellipsis, then, in The Pronouns is that area of the listening\/\nreading experience that provides a holding environment in which to im-\nmerse oneself and participate in the complex, transformative interrelation-\nship between self and other: he = she = they = you = all = I = it = we = one\n= thou = ye = this = diose = these = that = somebody = someone = anyone,\nand so on, as each of these pronouns replaces the previous one in a collec-\ntion of poems employing lines all in imperative form to be used as instruc-\ntions for the dancers. The result is partly one of static\/moving simultaneous\nconnectedness with the whole of experience, compared with the limited per-\nspective available from the standpoint of the specific identity of the writer\nor the reader alone. At this boundary, hearing and seeing, looking and lis-\ntening are interrelated and are paradoxically, dynamically in tension with\none another. Since the reading must take place in time, its music or its\nperformance will trace a trajectory of its own that may or may not be equiv-\nalent to one or another of the senses\u2014thus another sense, or mode of per-\nception, is evoked. Hearing Mac Low perform these works, of course,\nmakes these effects all the more accessible and apparent.\n\n    It is not only the concept of identity that is being displaced, in this and\n\n\nother works by Mac Low, but it is in the presumption (the sometimes\nnecessary illusion) that identity is, in actuality, completely separate from\nanything else. We are becoming what our perceptions make of us, and in\nthe aural, elliptical holding environment of the poem we can locate an ori-\nentation to experience within which we can let go of the specificity of the\nself and all of its officially documented narratives to enter into a world peo-\npled by unexpected definitions, determinations and relationships:\n\n    You are alone & start out by being a wire,\n\n    & you seem to have a purpose,\n    going about, as you do, being a unit.\n\n    Soon you\u2019re doing things to make a meal,\n\n    & then you\u2019re doing something as in the West,\n    as if you were \u201cawaking yesterday when the skin\u2019s\n    a little feeble\u201d:\n\n    you blacken something\n    while you write with a bad pen,\n    & smoke,\n    letting potatoes go bad\n    before you match a few parcels.\n\n    Being earth,\n\n    you harbor poison between cotton or go from\n    breathing to a common form,\n    testing different things,\n    touching them,\n    sponging them,\n    going under them,\n    numbering them,\n    wheeling them,\n    schooling them,\n    getting them.\n\n    You end up by giving enough of anything to anyone,\n                 (from \u201c4th Dance\u2014Being a Brother to\n\n                   Someone\u201411-17 February 1964,\u201d 17)\n\nOne of Mac Low\u2019s central concerns is to find ways to write that bypass\nthe limitations of the self. Another innovative and influential poet deeply\nconcerned with displacing the central role of the poet\u2019s identity in the pro-\ncess of writing poetry, particularly by placing close attentions to the\nrhythms and sounds of language, is Jack Spicer. In his Vancouver Lectures\nJack Spicer refers to Cocteau\u2019s film Orpheus in which the poet (as Orpheus)\nappears to be receiving his lines from a car radio. Spicer wrote about the\nprocess of writing poetry as receiving a kind of \u201cdictation,\u201d transmission or\n\u201cmessage from Mars.\u201d\u00b9\u2078 Perhaps another way to understand Spicer\u2019s con-\n\n\n\ncerns is to recognize that the poet\u2019s role has changed in contemporary life.\nWhile at one time the poet\u2019s central role was to declaim his or her beliefs,\nexperiences, wisdom, and ideas eloquently or adamantly through lyrics and\nnarrations in a kind of public speech or song-making, for many poets these\nnotions of a poet\u2019s essential role are no longer completely apt. Frequently,\nthe poet seems to view his or her expressive function more as a medium or\na \u201cconduit\u201d as Barrett Watten has phrased it.\u00b9\u2079 The poet is a researcher who\nmust listen closely to the sounds and voices of actuality to discover where\nthe poetry may exist within it. In an interview with Joan Retailack, in re-\nsponse to a quote from Theodor Adorno (\u201cThe greatness of works of art\nlies solely in their power to let those things be heard which ideology con-\nceals\u201d), John Cage said: \u201csomething that you just quoted leads in another\ndirection as though there were a subject. As though it was about something.\nWhich could be the emotions. Ideology would conceal by relationships.\nAnd those things being heard would be, so to speak, speaking the mysteri-\nous language of the unknown! (laughs) Which music could be imagined as\nbeing able to do. (laughs).\u201d \u00b2\u2070\n\n\n4\n\nOne of the clearest contexts in which to identify the efficacy of the poetic\naural ellipsis is in the poet\u2019s use of found language. The poem of found\nlanguage provides for both the poet utilizing it and the listener or reader\ndeciphering it a holding environment in which the poet\u2019s identity, beliefs,\nand personal ideology are not usually obvious as a central aspect of the\ncontent. The poetic impact in such cases arises mostly from juxtapositions,\nboth between the words of the poem and between the words and the\npoem\u2019s formal devices as well as the listener or reader\u2019s efforts to close the\nelliptical gaps between the words, ideas and fragments of narrative in\nthe poem. A passage from a recent poem of Joan Retallack may serve as an\nexample:\n\n     erratums for the tummy La La tin erratum neuter past errare all history\n     lies behind before Poetique Terrible delete as\/like Duchamp as Fred\n     Astaire to read epit ess pref b iv b neut p pple sundry errats\u2019 distended\n     verse to wander err erratic nudging ers root erratum rrroneus erroar The\n     World\u2019s a Book \u2019Tis falsely writ . . . et . . . cet . . . era\u00b2\u00b9\n\n     Drawing from the content as well as the form of errata slips, Retallack\ndeftly performs the alchemical magic of the found-language artist, at the\nsame time uncovering the potential transformative energy implicit in the\nrecognition of all error and distortion, be it typographical, spoken, philo-\nsophical, or perceptual. This energy is released by means of a similar access\nroute to the unconscious discussed by Freud in The Psychopathology of Every-\nday Life. Retallack transforms the scraps of language usually hardly glanced\n\n\nat into poetry that contains rhythmically complex music, wit, philosophical\nsweep, visual grace, presented in a linguistic environment of dynamic com-\npression. Retailack\u2019s method of drawing attention to each letter by means\nof using the reader\u2019s natural tendency to notice printed errors, to sound\nthem out internally and to associate to them freely, partly in order to detect\nthe unconscious meaning in these parapraxes, or slips of speech, is clear in\nthis passage. Although the reference is not mentioned in a list of source\nincluded with the text, I detect some echoes of Finnegans Wake, by James\nJoyce, which would certainly be one of the earliest examples of the inten-\ntional and frequent employment of the aural ellipsis, and certainly one of\nits literary origins.\u00b2\u00b2 Although the lines are drawn from various sources,\nthis in no way limits either the ideas or the vibrant lyricism of the language.\nErrata suite, by utilizing words as they appear to us in the inchoate flux of\neveryday experience, very much including the experience of silent and spo-\nken reading, as well as associative thinking, creates a kind of music that\nchallenges us to listen to the entire complexity of experience in its full den-\nsity. This is, of course, difficult poetry to read aloud and to hear read aloud.\nBut the process is valuable because it creates an opportunity to transform\nwhat might otherwise remain incommunicable internal experiences into\nconcrete, albeit fluid forms of external expression. This is what Jakobson\nmeans when he writes, \u201cThe principal vehicle for the displacements of the\nequilibrium [of language] are the elliptical and expressive aspects of lan-\nguage. The changes that attempt to reestablish the destroyed equilibrium in\nthe system of language play an essential role in the passage from the old\norder to the new\u201d (Jakobson, 179). At poetry readings where such poems as\nErrata suite are read aloud, and listened to conscientiously, both poet and\nlisteners are working together collaboratively to expand the boundaries of\nspoken and written language.\n\n    Another poet who has been central in opening up the exploration of\nelliptical tedhniques in poetry is Clark Coolidge. His book Space, published\nin 1970, is a classic in the masterful use of an aural elliptical form of writing\nand has been broadly influential. It was in reading and rereading this work\nalong with Ashbery\u2019s The Tennis Court Oath, Mayer\u2019s Story, Mac Low\u2019s The\nPronouns and Berrigan\u2019s The Sonnets that I first sensed that a new type of\npoetry had emerged, one that freely employed linguistic constructs in both\na visual and an aural form to evoke and evolve novel metalanguages. The\nmost evident aspect of these new metalanguages for me was that in reread-\ning the poems they seemed to transform themselves right before your eyes,\nkaleidoscopically refusing to stay in one place, or to be seen from one per-\nspective, and were extremely rich in aural associations. As with the greatest\ntraditionally written poems, returning to them one again and again redis-\ncovers a new poem, only in the case of these works this effect is greatly\nintensified. The poem \u201cthese\u201d from Space illustrates Coolidge\u2019s deceptive\nsimplicity of language and the deft lyricism that persists through the de-\nmanding absence of ordinary meaning:\n\n\n    Bers phone the the.\n\n    Give showed mail ing.\n\n    The on won so.\n\n    Ly fetch wonders note.\n\n    It\u2019s a gim, a de.\n\n    On the know, the on, the don\u2019t.\n\n    Back how\u2019s is backs.\n\n    To one it, it irons.\n\n    Ops a ed, a are any this.\n\n         Don.\n\n\n        Trucks one.\u00b2\u00b3\n\nThe reader is encouraged to try sounding out these words internally or\naloud. A few minutes of relaxed experimentation should make it obvious\nthat it is nearly impossible to focus on listening to these words without\nattempting to fill in the gaps. Although the end result of the experiment\nwill probably not lead to a grammatically clear sequence of statements, spe-\ncific and identifiable sound images will emerge. The poem provides a sound\nand visual structure for innumerable possible variations. It is in this sense\nthat this work is so apt as a holding environment within which the reader\nmay cocreate his or her own version of the poem while sounding it out\nwithin the aural ellipses of the given text. To read and particularly to hear\nthis type of work read by the poet encourages the listener or reader to\nparticipate actively in the performative aspect of the work. The reader or\nlistener is invited to become a participant in the creation of the poem\u2019s\noverall aesthetic context and its meaning.\n\n    It is no surprise, as was the case in one of the earliest, if not the earliest\npractitioners of the aural ellipsis, Gertrude Stein, that poets interested in\nsuch techniques would be interested in creating works for performance. Fi-\nona Templeton, who is now best known for her on-site performance work\nin such pieces as Tou\u2014The City,\u00b2\u2074 which worked on the novel premise of\nbeing presented to an audience of one (each audience member made a sepa-\nrate appointment and the piece took place on site in Times Square), pub-\nlished her work London in 1984. Fiona Templeton was born and raised in\nScotland and then lived for several years in London before moving to New\nYork. In this work her writing teems with echoes of her native uses of lan-\nguage and, in its inventive constructions, evolves a rich metalanguage of its\nown:\n\n    Come miss eagle be ladies barking come model by lick\n    not end hey I burn primary came well hip bone went be\n    heart be oval be fig madly hermit lamp shakes a curt\n    comb out prior and we win if cull be a coin mere fit\n    yell do mere sit red we gate else John come on me\n    pages me came man\u2019s came combs down in me in deer\n    hurt chit be he plastic great Marx and fish well silks in \u00b2\u2075\n\n\nIn this work, as in Coolidge\u2019s above, each word resounds tellingly with\nevery other word in the piece, not just in a linear sense, but on every plane,\nin any order or direction you might read it. At the same time, because of\nthe density of the sound and visual images, the passage can echo and reflect\ninnumerable facets of the settings and the actions being evoked. Every read-\ning is unique, densely layered, and the possibilities for reading the work\naloud greatly enriched, as the structure as well as the vocabulary allow for\nmany alternative readings on the part of the performer, as well as an imagi-\nnative, though demanding opportunity for interpretive and creative partici-\npation on the part of the listener. As in Coolidge\u2019s poem, Templeton\u2019s piece\nuses mostly simple words of one or two syllables that maximize and inten-\nsify the rhythmic continuity as well as the overall rhythmic, sonic, and musi-\ncal structure of the piece.\n\n     Other poets who have used found and invented language to create\ninnovative poetry that elicits unique forms of listening include Frank Kuen-\nstler, Armand Schwerner, Hannah Weiner, Don Byrd, Ray DiPalma, Mar-\nshall Reese, Madeline Gins, Bruce Andrews, Tina Darragh, P. Inman,\nDouglas Messerli, Rod Smith, Mark Wallace, Kim Rosenfield, and Robert\nFitterman. The poetically sophisticated use of found language by some of\nthe most distinguished experimental contemporary poets suggests that an\nimportant function of contemporary poetry is to present readers and listen-\ners with the sites and materials of the poem so as to invite them to copartici-\npate in its creation. In this sense, the writing of contemporary poetry has a\ntendency to become a more and more collaborative process, with the cre-\native functions of writers and readers becoming less and less distinguishable\nfrom one another, and, in a sense, even from poets and listeners, or writers\nand critics. These texts point the way to telling us how poems arc created\nand how to listen closely to our reponses in order to discover the experien-\ntial sites of the poem\u2019s constituent materials.\n\n    The found poem accentuates the physicality of the poem in both its\nwritten and heard forms. Hearing the aural ellipses within the poem of\nfound or invented language is also like discovering, by means of internal\nsoundings, openings in an otherwise impenetrable mass. Also, the found\npoem, like the recent scientific discovery that a meteorite uncovered long\nago may contain evidence of previous life on Mars, is a kind of proof that\npoetic life is \u201cout there,\u201d that it objectively exists and is embedded in every-\nday life. It is a piece of evidence that is also a site of language as poetry in\nsitu. As in the case of the Martian meteorite, the section of found poetry\noften looks and feels like a hefty \u201cchunk\u201d of the raw material from which\nthe poetic substance might be mined, in part by sounding out, by listening\nto where the raw poetic element within the substance might exist. In that\nsense, die aural ellipsis is the place where the tuning of die mind to the\npoetic wavelength takes place. And, in fact, for the time that your poetic\nreceiving \u201cradio\u201d remains on that wavelength it seems that it might ema-\nnate\u2014at least in small quantities\u2014from many other proximate sites. As you\n\n\n                    The Aural Ellipsis and the Nature of Listening -=_ 69\nlook out at the universe from the vantage point of the aural ellipsis it ap-\npears that disparate elements available in many kinds of places, times, and\ncategories might be placed in each other\u2019s proximity to see if a spark of\nconsciousness across the gap might engender the sounds and flash of po-\netry. By highlighting the possibilities of the poetic process within found\nmaterial, the poem also accentuates its potential for the listener to experi-\nence it as a transitional object because the found material itself has both\nsubjective and objective aspects.\n\n    The increased interest on the part of poets and readers in poetic con-\nstructions that can serve as transitional objects is an indication that the field\nof poetry and the culture with which it is engaged are going through a\ntransitional period. As with individuals, transitional periods of culture are\ncharacterized by the intensification of conflict around issues of identity and\nan intensified search via experimentation for new structures. An example in\nhuman development is adolescence. Experimentation with values, behaviors,\nand identities makes possible the discovery of modes of living around which\nnew senses of identity can be crystallized. The same process holds during\nsocial and cultural transitions, periods like ours characterized by conflict, the\ndissolution of old forms, experimentation, and the search for new forms.\nThis includes the creation of new structures, partly by means of incorporat-\ning within them a synthesis of the usefill parts of existing structures.\n\n    The environment of the found poem frequently elicits experiences of\nsensory overlap or synesthesia where close listening and reading give way\nto a combinatory apprehension of meanings, associations, and perceptions\nby all of the senses. One of the reasons that poetry readings are so im-\nportant in the evolution of contemporary poetry is that the full effect of the\npoem cannot be experienced until it is heard aloud, preferably in a group\ncontext where responses can be shared and discussed among the listeners\nand often with the poet herself. Since frequently the value of contemporary\npoetry is not so much in unraveling the thematic aspects of the poem but\nin offering a holding environment for the evocation and cocreation of inno-\nvative modes of language and communication, the poetry reading is one of\nthe key contexts for contemporary poetry to be shared and understood, and\nfor its effects to be disseminated. In this sense, much contemporary poetry\nis akin to music in that it is one thing to read the musical notations to\noneself but it is quite another to hear the music performed. The perfor-\nmance of poetry as a public event formalizes the poem as an artistic object\nevery bit as much as its publication. Just as photography helped to free\npainting from its traditional function of graphically depicting external real-\nity, the invention of recording techniques has transformed the poetry read-\ning itself into a potential publication event. The aural or video recording of\na reading is just as significant as a permanent document of a poem as a\nprinted version. Recording techniques have helped to free poets to become\nmore interested in experimenting with sound just as painters were helped\nby photography to be free to experiment with image, color, and form.\n\n\nWhile this is true for the oral performance of any type of poetry, it is partic-\nularly crucial in the type of poetry I am characterizing as embodying the\naural ellipsis, because it is in hearing the poem read aloud, particularly in\nthe voice of the poet who wrote it, that the listener has the best opportunity\nto understand the poet\u2019s specific intentions in selecting the sounds of the\npoem, as well as finding tire most apropos, rhythmic interweaving of his or\nher own inner stream of thinking and language into that listening. Reading\nthe poem later, the listener then has the opportunity of comparing the po-\net\u2019s manner of visualizing the poem as written text vis-\u00e0-vis the poet and\nlistener\u2019s combined realization of the poem read aloud. Listening, of course,\nalways includes the thoughts, feelings, and associations to the poem of the\nlistener.\n\n    The complex nature of the relationship between thinking and listening\nis at the heart of the experience of listening to poetry. The aural ellipses of\nthe contemporary poem ensure that there will be spaces for invention on\nthe part of the listener, and that the reading of the poem will not only be\nthe public presentation of ideas, but will function as a medium for what is\notherwise incommunicable between one mind and another. This is all the\nmore important in contemporary life where there is so much talking and so\nlittle listening. Not only is listening becoming a lost art, but there are fewer\nand fewer opportunities to learn how to listen. Listening to nearly any tele-\nvision or radio talk show will prove this in a few minutes. At the same time,\nthis avoidance is understandable, given that we live in a world that pounds\neveryone constantly with excruciating emotional trauma, much of it fre-\nquently presented in the media in an almost unbearably blaring and glaring\nmanner. It should be no surprise to anyone that under these circumstances\nthe failure to communicate, or the wish to find ways of avoiding communi-\ncation, are pandemic. In such an environment, a key survival skill is the\nability to sometimes turn off the external environment\u2014to not listen. There\nis so much to communicate and so little time and energy available to listen\nin an atmosphere of constant trauma and anxiety.\n\n    Working their way through the poem of found language, or any poem\noffering the open spaces of the aural ellipsis, persistent readers and listeners\nhave no choice but to talee the time to listen to each word as if they were\nhearing and following the meandering, intuitive steps of Benjamin\u2019s Baude-\nlairean^twww finding their ways through the Paris boulevards and arcades.\nListeners to such poems must learn to mentally and emotionally weave and\nbob, to be comfortable hearing and reading both randomly and stealthily,\nto discover, as if by accident, previously inaccessible areas of language and\nthought. At times risky or potentially subversive, at other times offering a\nsense of integration, purpose, and insight, the aural ellipses of the contem-\nporary poem invite listeners to respond with their own inner resonances, to\ntake the poem to its immediate and relative subjective and objective realiza-\ntion. The result is nothing less than a radical transformation in the architec-\ntonic topology of the text\/sound relationship.\n\n\nEpilogue\n\nListening is living in time. It is allowing time for the events of living to register\nthemselves in us. \u201cStop to listen\u201d\n\n     I am interested in the way insignificance transforms itself or is tran formed\ninto significance or vice versa, the way specificity is changed into the general and\nthe other way around. Inside an old language we may no longer understand\nsomething can be hidden. The smallest fragment of part of the thing we are look-\ning for . . . language itself is the translation. I wanted to speak in an unknown\ntongue ... in my wildest dreams. But, even now, so soon after, I can't remember\nwhich way it went, it was so long ago . . . Pm not asleep . . . whichever way I\nam going.\n\n     Something is wrapped around me like a shell... I wanted to smash things\ntoo ...

The meaning of an\ninterval of experience is defined throughout by the implied or covert\nmeaning of its end. The tension of an interval arises out of the anxiety\nof evolving a meaning for an event. Ravel confounds this process not by\nemploying an obsessive doubting or repetition of themes, but by allowing\na focussed uncertainty to remain. The rhythms are not halting or arbi-\ntrary yet they may be felt as not quite intended or distracted but determ-\ninedly so, not just tentatively. He gains the continuity ordinarily\n\n\nobtained through a form that tantalizes with eventual resolution by arous-\ning different levels of dreaminess and wakefulness. We wake from a dream\nto enter, clearly, a daydream.\n\n        *\n\n     Writing ordinarily stresses its function of \"righting\" the meanings\nof words and word combinations. But the graphic materials of writing\nalso have a mapping and marking function. As records are evidence, the\nreified word is a token of identity.\n\n     The sign distributes the imaged perception as an imprint transfer-\nable to the \"scratching\" of thought against the cave walls of the mind.\nSigns transmute imaged perception into thought: at the terminus points,\nalways approximate, always tautological.\n\n     Each subdivision of an interval is discrete when it is noticed over\ntime, but the remaining subdivisions are more blurred when specific ones\nare selected for focus. Similarly, a grapheme within a nominal phrase\nsuch as a headline or a title would be conditioned by the phrases subse-\nquently selected for emphasis. In present consciousness any subdivision\nof an intervallic constellation can exist in any combination of the three\ntemporal dimensions or are apperceptively consigned to temporal mutability.\nThe same is true for the relativity between intervals of script and all the\nhierarchical organizations within the text. The more general inscription\n(such as a headline, a title or a chapter, or the capital letter at the\nbeginning of a line in a poem) conditions the mode of focussing the relat-\ned text. The equivalent in remembering is the hierarchical arrangement\nof significance. The base word of significance is sign.\n\n     Poetry is a graphic form of unrighting the publicly codified coloca-\ntion of grapheme with symbolized ordinary writing and speech usage and the\nimaging function of the mind. The conceptual experience of a poem causes\na reconnection with the acausal, atemporal conceiving of meaning by reap-\nportioning the relative values of the scalar organizing function of the\nperceiving process and the inscriptive, defining level of pre-conscious\nverbal imaging.\n\n     It is a certain tone I am after, embellished by persistent varying\nshades of association. I repeat it as I am hearing it in a kind of sus-\npended listening, paying attention to and allowing to dissolve certain\nobsessive memories. Deductions, or rather, reductions or vapors like\nthese, afterwards seem immediately familiar, pre-cognitive, felt through-\nout an extended deja-vu atmosphere during an imploded time sequence. The\npuzzle is attempted only once in order for the observers to immediately\nwitness its decomposition. It is a simultaneous recording, unwinding and\nplaying, joining and dismantling, similarities momentarily continuing to\nhold sway throughout or just long enough after an initial and suddenly\nheightened series of contrasts. Such points of connection are heard in\n\n\nspecific invariable tones and intervals. The names of these sounds and\nfeelings may be the objects and words memories attach themselves to. But\nthe feelings that yearned for those names, the ones that offer themselves\nlater as keepsakes are really more memorable. Not the images which are\nnow absent, but the thawing and sketching around that in coming times\nwill be added to the fondness which grows around such replacements for the\nquality of the actual event.

Poetic\ncomposition is an activity which subtly alters the rules that govern\nthe relationship between the ordering of thought and allowing it to\nswoon into reverie. Remembering is at its base a connective mode of\ncognition. From this is expropriated its power to order, to value, to\nrecord, to create, to historicize, to catalogue, describe, recreate,\nmake safe, controllable and distant, - to signify.\n\n        *\n\n     As many times as I try to grasp my solitude, I am abruptly thrown\ninto the image of the Other and its absence, mute spectator. Or just as\nsuddenly to stop, trapped in the spectacle of my fear of his\/her absence,\nthe patient, responsive, loving Other situated at the side of all that\nis depriving. To switch so suddenly is to plunge into the mercy of a\nsimple truth: as neutral as the irrational is the subtly perfect, the\npreposition of all imposters, clown of confusion, enigmatic signature of\n\n\nincomprehension.\n\n\n                                       *\n\n18.

As in ordinary thought, to read need not be simply to sys-\ntematically connect mental processes to their current contexts but to\nother, related aspects of present or past experience. Such an idiosyn-\ncratic variation in reading any text is inevitable, especially in re-\nreading.\n\n     Memory becomes history when the impact of events is such that the\nremembered event is still having its impact when the memory is trigger-\ned and is more multiply caused by immediate necessity. History is\nnecessary when memory threatens to fail. Memory is aroused by emotional\nand physical need. As culture (apparently) changes more rapidly, more\nattention must be concentrated on the meaning of the shifts. When we\nare insecure about the memory function we invoke historical (ordering)\nparadigms.\n*\n\n     Sometimes I allow somebody else, in some way, to speak through me.\nI know the somebody else is me, but I also know that some information\nis coming through that perhaps was picked up peripherally, or has been\nforgotten and is silently colliding and thus combining with something\nelse.

I live in a world of signs which acausally\ndirect my consciousness. Thought is writing, just as thinking is proto-\nlinguistic. Thought is reading just as listening enforces a transposition\nof an interval of related sounds into a specific inner focus of attention.\nWriting silences a babel of voices each of which calls attention to its\nown point of origin. At the root of all comprehension exists an indeter-\nminate number of possible meanings which are coming into being, into\nconsciousness. All understanding or visual or aural recognition contains\nwithin it an underlying chaotically disordered core in flux, moving as\na system of connected points toward an entropic state of inertia, a stable\npattern.\n\n     All systematized language is oppressive insofar as it supports ideo-\nlogically based repression. Repression serves psychic economy. To\n\"forget\" the origin of a meaning, or its specific and unique context,\nis to suppress energy directed towards associative expansion and purposive\nexpression, that is, the purpose is blurred as is the associative gestalt.\n\n     Thinking, reading and writing are forms of preconscious play. Think-\ning itself, which is imagined to accompany reading, is synchronistically\ntilted, one moment toward, the next, away from, experience. Like speak-\ning, reading and writing, thinking is imagined to be a translation of\nexperience. But this translation does not completely evolve apposite\nto experience. The sign constantly displays its maddening ability to out-\n\n\nwit its supposed \"associated\" thought, and as its creator seizes on the\nreminiscence of its genesis, the acausal connecting process of associa-\ntion determines the actual signification. This eventually becomes the\n\"meaning\" of the experience. These meanings ordinarily are interpreted\nin intervallic measures or \"beats\" of time. Meaning entropically moves\ntowards \"familiarization,\" which is static, rather than \"defamiliariza-\ntion\" which is nascent, and closer to the fulcrum of the acausal axis of\ninterval (instance) and pattern (generalization).\n\n\n     You lose the actual qualities of the experience when you try to be\ntoo precise about the specifics of each interval of the flow. Any exhaus-\ntive rendering becomes a compilation of instances. The historical per-\nspective makes instances appear less improvised than they actually are.\nThe decisive moment, the dramatic realization, is itself a heightening\nof the particular instance from a valued perspective. One examines what\none wants to know thoroughly again and again. This is called testing,\nexperimentation.\n\n     We wait and try again. We measure and take note. We generalize and\nenumerate. We sift through. This sifting, this remeasurement of experi-\nences, one combined with another leads to connections which are imbued\nwith the feeling of discovery, that are remarkable.\n\n     Now, as I look out through the porthole of this ferry, even from this\ndistance, I am thinking that one small rectangle of graduated color,\nyellow white to pink to black, to specks of, pinpoints of, electric white\nlight to blue, brings to light, to mind, the entire dawn.\n\n\nNICK PIOMBINO"},{"uid":"NickPiombino_WritingandExperiencing_1980","author":"Nick Piombino","shortTitle":"Writing and Experiencing","title":"Nick Piombino | Writing and Experiencing | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/043.html","text":"\nWRITING AND EXPERIENCING\n\n\n     Writing is unbounded by paradigms, and its paradigms are subsumable\nconsumed by its forms. Associations to a poem\u2019s instances are not fixed\nby its formative instants, to the intervals of perception, thought and\nexperience the words designate. Another reason why, technically, the\npoem and its elements have no history, no precedents. The poem and its\nelements revive an obsolete definition of that word: prognostication,\npresage, sign. The words prophesy their return in other spheres of\nexperience. They are repeated as a mirror reproduces a silent effigy of\nan object and as one harmonic liberates and proliferates its possible\nmodulations. The preceding transformations appear to lead inevitably\nto a moment, a lyrical configuration that is not only discrete but is\nalso an interval, a transitional point in a rhythmic succession of mo-\nments.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     They repeat themselves, not as a mirror echoes its content, but as\none harmonic sound liberates a set of possible related modulations, and\nsimultaneously lends those previous to it the quality of having engen-\ndered something unique and specific despite the irrefutable evidence of\nthe senses that the moment was not discrete but was part of a continu-\nity.\n\n*\n\n     Ravel and Debussy: The musical dissolve- sudden sonic wipe outs of\nthe interval just heard- sudden lyrical expression or quick aside in wri-\nting, a parallactical mode of self-definition.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     The functions and character of paradigms in poetry are both quali-\ntatively and quantitatively different than in any other writing. Aes-\nthetic intentions are usually paramount, whether the actual instances\ncited are expressed for historical, emotional, musical, visual, philo-\nsophic, political or personal impact. In no other art are these rela-\ntionships so delicately balanced and so easily misunderstood. In and\nof itself, for the poet, the production of any poem, or any element in\na poem constantly brings the question of the purpose of the paradigm\ncited immediately to the fore. For this reason, the pulls are strong\ntowards the Scylla of historicity and the Charybdis of obfuscation.\nIn the former the paradigm seems clear: like the poet, the poem moves\nthrough the media of time and experience. Since there is no para-\ndigm for poetry- or experience- this is possible and technically\nacceptable. But the danger here is that a paradigm is, in a hidden way,\neven in a deceptive way, being re-introduced. That paradigm might run\n\n\nlike this: since I am a poet, my consciousness is a poetic process and\ninstants of that consciousness are markings on a map of my poetic geog-\nraphy. Again, technically, this is true, and even necessary to take\ninto account when writing poetry. But when this mode is established as\na paradigm there is a radical reduction in the scope of a poem and the\nscale of the elements are too rigidly established on a one-to-one basis\nvis-a-vis each other.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     The chant and the song elude the limitations of linear narration\nby means of the \u2019\u2019haunting\u201d refrain. Through harmonic, repeating, re-\nverberating, echoing and iconographic alternation the \u2019\u2019flicker\u201d effect\nof language transcends the \u2019\u2019flat\u201d character of historicism. To histori-\ncism, ambiguity is a threat, as is projection, because it is experienced\nas intrusive, too immediately and suddenly intersubjective, and not\neasily subject to the ordinary processes of remembering.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     The mutative relationship of poetry to art is akin to that of\nphilosophy to science, science to technology, technology to the art of\ncommunication, art to language arts, etc.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     The problematics of space= the problematic of the human relation-\nship to space.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     The same for matter and time.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     What is the relationship of this to the appeal of density, or rapid\nexperiences of strong emotional impact directly juxtaposed against the\nmaterial facticity of language ?\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     \"[My sense of language is that it is matter and not ideas- i.e.\nprinted matter.

Experience is fixed through re-enactment and is sustained\nby emotional memory. Writing and experience have dissimilar flows,\npartly caused by their dissimilar mediums- one static, non-human and\n\n\ninorganic, the other utterly physical and recognizable by movement.\nOnly the experience of reading adds an experiential character to writing.\nIn any case, like a forgotten ruin or monument, it continues to haunt\nus in its facticity as object. But writing is best understood unread,\nor most recognizable by its paradoxical relationships to memory, and\nthereby to actual experience. Writing is characteristically monumental,\nnot so much in memory, but in reading, particularly in re-reading. So\nthat re-reading adds a new dimension to reading- the characteristically\nparallactic quality in poetry is related to its projective devices.\nThese give an overtone, an afterimage to the time directly before and\nafter reading poetry, of meaning that is akin to the meanings derived\nfor assessing experiences, but not its exact double.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     The prevailing distinction between poetry and rhetoric illustrates\none ordinary instance of the au courant literary distinction between\n\"writing\" and \"writing about.\" But the difficulties some people have\nwith fragments in art is a similar aesthetic reaction that prefers the\nextended prose piece- which apparently has all the virtues of the energy\nimplicit in a rhetorical flow of writing without rhetoric\u2019s disposabil-\nity- to the \"short poem.\" So \"writing\" would be synthesizing its own\nstructure while \"writing about\" would somehow be presupposing some ex-\nternal referent or axis of explanation. Poems are universes because of\nthe parallactic relationship of words between and words within;languages.\n\n\n                                    *\n\n\nThe poem and the reader are equidistant from the meaning of the poem.\n\n\n                                    *\n\n\n     My secret: to know that I am withholding something.

Historicism allies itself with words, knowing its actual\nscale values but distrusting its changeability (translate instability).\nTaking language truly seriously as a partly known, unknowable form of\nenergy is instantly recognizable to historicism as an antithetical\nchallenge. Historicism debunks efforts to reify poetic language, ex-\ncept sometimes in art and art history (as in the manifestoes of Dada).\nWords closely seen are mirrors of consciousness, tones of thought and\nfeelings, traces and bones of human experience and not simply mechanical\nreproductions and manipulations of the processes of memory, of the visu-\nalization of the causalities of historical development, the interlocking\nlinks of historical narrative, the imagistic jig-saw puzzles of tradi-\ntional poetic formalism.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     Even though most fiction and theater would have it the other way\naround, there is actually no point in personifying the essences of human\nexperience. Reenacted experience, if it is to speak to us in a language\nthat has authentic possibilities of extension, a conceivable actual\npracticability for intersubjective contact, cannot simply mime the \u2022\nfaces, gestures and expressions that seemingly originated its conception.\nIt is for this reason that poetry is ultimately the most realistic of\nall human expressions in that it places absolute realistic clarity and\nempathy about psychological, political and existential experiences to\nthe side of encompassing, in all its variable senses of exemplification,\nthe pure essence of experience. Of course in purely temporal terms,\nthis is a very long range view of practicality. Other sorts of practi-\ncality certainly have their uses for human endeavors. Still, the signs\nof these gestures, the naming of moments that codify instantaneously\nhuman communication - \"we all see this\"- we imagine we connect to those\nfeelings in memory. Memories are followed by language like paths lead-\ning in from various directions. Though the faces of those moments are\ntheir histories, the inner core of consciousness is not a film or mirror\nbut a series of hieroglyphs. It is a map- a specific array of markings-\nlines and points and variable distances and durations: ever wandering,\noboes babbling in counterpoint in memory following the motive of the\nmain and developed themes curiously dogging them. Wandering touches of\nfelt experiences enfolded by the inner thoughts surrounding them-not\none-not even a thousand voices could fully characterize that resolution.\nIt is heard in one voice, but it is spoken at once in all languages\nthat is its own language.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n\n     Poetry reconnects the occurrence and the instance.\n\n\n     parallax- the apparent change in the position of an object re-\nsulting from the change of direction or position from which it is\nviewed.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     tide day- at any point the time between two successive high tides,\n                                    *\n\n     We can get an approximation of experience in words in that memories\nbecause of their ambiguous character, in the reading and relating of\nwords to the subtleties of actual experience, reenact the meanings\nwe applied to experiences, just as we reenact the meanings we apply to\nthe sequence of words. When we say to ourselves, in reading, \"That's\nhow I feel\" or \"That's how I see it myself\" we are often tempted to\nunderline the words we were reading when we experienced the feeling of\ncomprehension. Yet then, strangely, when we return to read the under-\nlined words reading that particular passage doesn't still hold the\nmeaning we had imagined it held.\n\n\n            *\n\n\n     \"There is no need to be astonished at the part played by words in\ndream-formation.

Memories and awareness of the\npresent collapse into an experiential field composed of verbal presences\nwhich can be re-sounded for various interpretations and alternative direc-\ntions. Both in writing poetry and in free association one listens for\nmeanings rather than directing the thought process in a purposive way to\nget to them.\n\n    When a poet chooses the moment he will inscribe on the page the\nlettered representation of what he wishes to present to be read, he\nbecomes the creator of his own reading. As he rereads he can experience\nthe moment he chose to move from the position of listener to his own\nthought to that of recorder. These signs he makes to re-read are the\nhieroglyphic constructs by which he hopes to disclose the experiential\n\n\nprocess simultaneous to its construction. Not that the line or the poem\nis merely a \u2019\u2019slice of thought\u201d corresponding to the naturalistic construct\nof a stage upon which the writer re-enacts a narrative representation of\nhis conception of existence. The very choice of moments for writing poetry\nis part of the mysterious flow of attention alert in the mind of the poet\nto the tides and currents of his own perceptions. By means of his poems\nhe attempts to catch his thoughts in their nascent state, malleable, yet\nin a way that their original sense may be maintained. When he abandons\nthe possibility of authenticity, celebrates the inevitability of masks\nand roles, \u2019\u2019plays the game\u201d or imitates what he imagines would be successful,\nhe is resting from his more difficult work of finding clues to the solution\nhis unconscious keeps presenting to him in various kinds of puzzles and\ndisguises. Aware of the silence which ever more deeply underlines his\nutterances, drawn on by the music represented by these letters from his\nunconscious, by a kind of retrograde movement of language, he is led closer\nto the other voices of his self. Finding ways of noticing these thoughts\nat the moments of their inner presentation, he may isolate momentarily\nwhat is ordinarily most immediate to his experience but otherwise most\nelusive. When we read poems we simultaneously listen to our personal\nassociations as well as the intended meanings of words. \u2019\u2019Words are notes\non the keyboard of the imagination.\u201d (Wittgenstein) And Freud: \u201dIt is\nonly too easy to forget that a dream is a thought like any other.\u201d Like\nthe sequential motifs in dreams, a poem\u2019s meaning often appears to be\nmore verbal than literal, resonating with meaning rather than describing\nit. Sometimes sequences in poems (and dreams and thoughts) can be drawn\ntogether like fragments in a collage, to open another implied area not yet\nfound. What is before can become what is next (to). For example, in\nwriting poetry the very next thought may seem technically inacceptable\nbut allowed to remain in the poem may later reveal an otherwise hidden\nintention.\n\n     In psychoanalysis attempts toward free association reveal to the analy-\nsand emotions which underlie his everyday conflicts. These verbalizations\nare interpreted by the analyst and the analysand with the goal of proli-\nferating the analysand\u2019s awareness of alternatives. Sometimes these\nfeelings correspond to the strong emotions the poet experiences while\nwriting. While observing and directing the thought process experiences\nof subjective and objective comprehension fuse and alternate, accelerating\nthe mind towards associations of various types of meanings, intensities\nand emotions. Language demands to be said, heard, felt and comprehended\nall at once out of the sphere of choosing actions and immersed in the\nconsciousness of its own tremors, intentions and implications.

For this reason, remembering continually transforms the effect\nof specific associations and images on the meanings or symbolic values\nwe assign to them as we write and reread what is written. Since remem-\nbering causes such transformations by overlaying, condensing, and dis-\nplacing associations, this process prevents permanent linking of images\nto specific associations* Such mutability as to the length of time\nimages may be linked to specific associations in the thought process\nalso makes it possible, in writing, by such methods as juxtaposition,\naural association, repetition, and physical placement in the text, to\nalter their character, symbolic value or relationship to the composition\nas a whole (their \u2019\u2019scale\u201d). Written images, as mental projections, are\ncontinually re-scaled against other images by the transformation of\nlexical associations as the composition proceeds. The harmonic, rhyth-\nmic and symbolic value of images undergo changes in scale depending on\nthe lexical and aural associations chosen by the reader or writer to be,\nat any given moment, their signal source or \"key\".\n\n    Of all types of writing, poetic discourse, like the psychoanalytic\ntechnique of free association, most tends to cause the experience of\nremembering to be idiosyncratic, personal, and dehistoricized. By the\nlatter term, I mean that the stories or fantasies elaborated from the\ntexts or associations may be constructed or deconstructed at any given\nmoment by current associations. The method of free association flattens\nout the relative value of images by placing them in a one-to-one rela-\ntionship to consecutive fragments of ideas, unlike purposive forms of\nthought patterns fixed by sequential ordering. Chance and random\nsequencing of images can have a similar re-synchronizing \/ de-synchroni-\nzing effect, by causing shifts between coded message readings of the\nfragments and the intermittently phased current \"readings\" of present\nimages looped into signal words and thoughts. Specifically the diffi-\nculty in poetry with imaging is that after-images often tend to be\nsustained in remembering much longer than is necessary for the most\nmusical, rhythmically modulant grouping of sequential or juxtaposed\nsigns. Too clear a statement, meaning or purpose might scale down, for\n\n\ninstance, a group of signs so radically as to make their source over-\ntones too minimal to have any impact on the composition as a whole.\n\n    When word, object, sign and trace synesthetically embrace the mind\nand the page, associating symbol with its mark, title, token, signal,\nand glyph, symbolic values\u2019 rigid hold on meaning is weakened. The\nimage\u2019s source then can again have a monitoring, signalizing effect on\nthe way meanings and intensities of meaning are assigned. The modally\ntransformable image is one that is subject to the shadowing, tinting\neffects of one meaning juxtaposed against another, layered on and under\nit, like the creation of an approximate sign in lieu of foregoing any\npossibility of recollection. Or one fixed sequence of meanings may be\ntransformed into another register by creating new associations to a\nmutation or variation of the text, like reversing one part of the\nsequence and allowing one set of symbols before that part and after\nthat part to remain the same. In writing this may be an alteration of\nsyntax within a customary phrase which can be translated back again\nwithin the thought process simultaneously or almost so, as the text is\nread, just as an inflection or modification in speech might entirely\nalter the character of an expression in relation to a purely syntactical\nform of the same idea. Again, the resulting transmutative effect would\nbe caused by the feedback between a meaning and an intentionally added\nreframing of its tonal value affecting a shift in its remembered,\nhistoricized meaning.\n\nNICK PIOMBINO\n"},{"uid":"NickPiombino_WritingandRemembering_1979","author":"Nick Piombino","shortTitle":"Writing and Remembering","title":"Nick Piombino | Writing and Remembering | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/017.html","text":"\n            WRITING AND REMEMBERING\n\n\nHistory is a catalogue of endings but poetry speaks of being, of\nbeginnings. Through an experience of linguistic re-creation by Immer-\nsion in a semantic continuous present of simultaneities, echoes,\nsymbols, variously shaded fragments of raw and refined perceptions, the\ntext (and its corresponding thought process) is momentarily liberated\nfrom its history (memory) and from its history-making function (remem-\nbering) . This is why poetry is uniquely free, compared to related\ndisciplines like philosophy and psychology, from its own history. Its\nelements, including its formal properties, are subject to aesthetic,\nbut not temporal, critiques. There is no linear historical conceptual\ndevelopment \u2014 only a process of eroding and building.\n\n    Poetry tends to have an ambivalent relationship toward any temporal\nfunction to which it is assigned. Unlike most other human endeavors,\nat certain moments, often its best ones, it cloaks itself in obscurity,\nwithdraws from everyday life and takes the form of a static, receptive\nobject. A process made to be acted upon, germinative, wood and oxygen\n\n\nwaiting to be ignited by a determinant, but not necessarily parallel,\nflash of thought\u00bb And this is how it transcends history and is not\nonly to be recognized and remembered, but contemplated, like the Sphinx.\n\n        Writing as remembering is nominative, ordering, and elicits from\n    its reading a fixed, functional relationship. But poetry can be\n    composed of any number of continuously altered, modulated and interre-\n    lated emotional tones, purposes and intentions. These real, apparent\n    and illusory intentions are usually consciously parodied, at least at\n    some point in a poem, if not in its form, creating still another\n    shifting ground of contexts.\n\n        Historicity, that is, legitimizing or authenticating the raison\n    d'etre of a work or text by establishing its historical relevance or\n    historical significance as a document or art historical event, binds\n    language to fixed significances by ordering its syntax into descrip-\n    tions of familiar or unfamiliar sequences of related perceptions or\n    memories. Language, though bound to time like this by its passive\n    connection with the process of recall can be made to listen to itself.\n    Again and again heard differently, through its poetry, language directs\n    attention to its plastic and iconographie qualities by means of a kind\n    of lexic hovering in and around and subterranean plummeting through\n    meaning and memory. Familiar connotations, meanings and connections\n    fade into apparently new ones, ones otherwise too close and familiar\n    to sense and feel.\n\n        To read poetry is to enjoy a mimetic gesticulation towards the\n    thought process, to demand from it alternatives to ordinary remembering\n    and comprehension. In this elusive, decorous, ceremonial absence of\n    significant reportage, history is a minor character in a timeless\n    masque enacted in the evolving theater of language.\n\n        NICK PIOMBINO\n"},{"uid":"NickPiombino_WritingandSelfDisclosure_1978","author":"Nick Piombino","shortTitle":"Writing and Self-Disclosure","title":"Nick Piombino | Writing and Self-Disclosure | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn3\/pictures\/012.html","text":"\n        WRITING AND SELF-DISCLOSURE\n\n\n     With the publication of The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), Freud\nreframed and refined an enigma which haunts most literary efforts to\ncombine a revelation of self and other: can, and if it can, how does\nthis aspect of literature help anyone else? He showed that by analyzing\nhis own dreams by use of an associative method of interpretation he could\nheal his own neurosis. In a uniquely psychological fashion Freud\nsucceeded in convincing many members of his own generation of contempla-\ntive readers, and many of those of succeeding generations, of the value\nof self-reflection. By transposing his findings into a viable mode of\nintersubjective discourse, he proposed a vehicle found in practice to\nrelease previously inhibited psychic energies. Like an artist, an\nanalysand with the help of his analyst, by disclosing his inner psychic\nprocess, would connect with the core of his being and by completing this\ncircuit, re-integrate his personality.\n\n     Just as the Senoi Indians discovered and exploited in their group\nreveries, Freud found that an effort to probe the unconscious has\ndistinctly healing effects. Like the shaman, the poet experiences the\nhealing power of the act of writing through the reading and rereading of\ntexts. Now, with parallel concerns, the psychoanalytic theorist, (cf.,\nthe work of Harry Guntrip) can return to the group the labyrinth of\ncommon self-deceptions concealed in unconscious mental processes.\n\n     For poets, and readers of poetry, a technique of sharing dreams is\nreadily available\u2014through the exchange of texts. These texts are reve-\nlations of a poet\u2019s direct encounter with the process of creating a\nlanguage structured in a way commensurate with his personal need to\narticulate his perceptions. The mapping of this path for the contemporary\npoet is often dotted with islands or cities of personal disclosure\u2014over\nand over he names himself because it is through this successive identifi-\ncation of selves that he literally knows where he is. He can no longer\nidentify with any other family names but his own. The other is no longer\nbrother or sister or son or daughter, another symbol on another herald,\nbut simply the legend of another map of the same terrain.\n\n     The boldest of contemporary poets are often the least shy about\nrevealing themselves. What saves, for example, John Ashbery\u2019s poetry\nfrom its own formalism is its readiness to blurt out its author\u2019s human\nvulnerabilities. Whether his lines or sentences are fragmentary (as in\nThe Tennis Court Oath) or sustained and elaborated (as in Three Poems) y\nI feel the presence of a willingness, even if it might sometimes appear\nunexpected, or arbitrary, to share his humanness with me. This is what I\nhear in what others might describe as \"obscure personal associations.\"\nHe confronts the possibility of a voluntary withdrawal on the part of his\nreader because of embarrassment or confusion. We see ourselves in this\nbecause we know that we have also consented to turn away at times from\n\n\n   the painful clarity of identifying, for example, certain kinds of access\n   to hidden truths about ourselves. A voice in one of Ashbery\u2019s poems\n   mutters \"\u2019Once I let a guy blow me.\/ I kind of backed away from the\n   experience.\u2019\"\n\n        The contemporary poet discovers his formal matrices through a\n   process of self-disclosure that is contiguous with his creations. This\n   process reveals to him the form that is hinted at in his conscious and\n   unconscious intentions at the outset of the poem, and what he knows\n   intuitively about how this particular work fits into his more long range\n   formal intentions. The thoughts that occur as he is creating the poem,\n   like the details of the interpretation of a part of a dream, on first\n   sight may seem disconnected, fragmentary, insignificant, often best illu-\n   minate the reader (for the poet, self-reminders) about his intentions.\n\n        Yet these self-disclosures put a discomforting pressure on our\n   willingness to trust this bizarre demand for confidence. From the begin-\n   ning of the poem we realized that not only may he disappoint us but he\n   might also mislead us. Out of this conflict and tension, sensing the\n   pull of his reader\u2019s anxiety and absence, the poet evokes from his being\n   remnants of his private existence to remind us, along the way, of his\n   particular vulnerabilities. Yet it is just this process which is likely\n   to wrench the poem from the domain of convention and rhetoric. Such\n   resonances may add to his poetry more authentically and spontaneously the\n   harmonic overtones and kaleidoscopic facets that are perhaps more tact-\n   fully obtained through irony, baroque vocabulary, deliberate primitivism,\n   camp naivete and \"dumbness,\" repetition and charm.

The argument runs like this: a child,\npausing before his book, falls into a reverie. This daydream, composed\n\n\nin part of excessive thinking about power and mastery and a concurrent,\nif hidden and counter-pointed theme of loss, an anticipated, almost yearned\nfor loss, becomes equated with a particular visit to the ocean on an over-\ncast day. The objects employed in his fantasy are transposed harmonically\nand modally into its emotional leitmotifs. The visual complements the\nemotional tense but cannot surpass it. The child is not exhaustively\nreading the seascape. His eidetic imagery is fastened to the concepts\npreceding it. Entranced as he is in his thoughts, his actions contribute\nto an air of unselfconscious movement. A momentary breakthrough of sun-\nlight between clouds interrupts the melancholy quality of his meditations\nand the spell is half broken, because we see him again engaged in reading.\nOr is he merely seeing the printed words, his gaze still directed within,\nas the sound of the sea thunders loudly into his consciousness and the\nvoices and activity and movement rush into his field of attention.\n\n 2.

He likes maxims, tautological\nwitticisms that temporarily acquit and illuminate with guided opacity the\nsteady pointed shadings toward the outcoming familiarity of the chosen\npuzzle: is he dreaming of the words themselves, divided as they are with\neach selected entry seal illustrated in a deluxe edition of signs?\n\n 4.   \"They can see right through me,\" thinks the child.

The arbitrary,\nhuman, cultural determination of the symbolic categories or code which\nunderly judgments of utility or means-ends pragmatics is reduced, in\nthese theories either to an uncritical naturalism or to an individual-\nistic utilitarianism that merely reproduces the mystified world view of\nbourgeois society. Accordingly, Sahlins\u2019 goal, in the end, is not merely\nto assert the primacy of the symbolic but to render a cultural account\nof bourgeois society itself.\n\n     En route to this analysis of the \"symbolic structure in the material\nutility\" of bourgeois society, Sahlins critically examines the\n\"practical reason\" implicit in several schools of anthropological thought.\nWhile acknowledging\u2014 indeed taking his cue from \u2014 Marx\u2019s own early\ntheoretical realization that human beings produce a \"mode of life\"\nthrough their transformation of nature, and do not produce merely out of\nsome biological necessity, Sahlins finds that Marx\u2019s actual analyses of\ncapitalist production in the Grundrisse and Capital reduce this \"cult-\nural\" moment to a predicate of production rather than seeing the cultural\nor symbolic coordinates of the mode of production itself. For example,\nwhile Marx lays bare the symbolic core (\"fetishism\") of the exchange-\nvalue of commodities, he seemingly is blind to the cultural construction\nof use-values and the needs or utilities they supposedly satisfy, render-\ning this aspect of production a self-evident, pragmatic, and transparent\nresponse to \"natural\" human needs...\n\n     That Marx attributes human needs and the motivation to produce use-\nvalues to satisfy those needs to a naturalistic and pragmatic rationality\nleads Sahlins to find in Marx\u2019s \"pre-symbolic\" anthropology an essential\ncontinuity with the \"bourgeois economizing\" found in other theories of\npractical reason: \"...the species to which Marx\u2019s \u2019species-being\u2019 belongs\nis Homo economicus...Maxx's concept of human nature is a metaphor of\ncapitalist rationality.\" And just as Baudrillard, in The Mirror of\nProduction, sees Marx\u2019s theory as the culmination of political economy\nand calls for a move to the analytical level of symbolic exchange, so\nSahlins concludes that \"...production is the realization of a symbolic\nscheme,\" and points the way toward a cultural analysis which might give\n\n\nus a \"...theoretical account ...for production as a mode of life...\":\n\n      By the systematic arrangement of meaningful differences\n     assigned the concrete, the cultural order is realized also\n     as an order of goods. The goods stand as an object code\n     for the signification and valuation of persons and occasions,\n     functions and situations. Operating on a specific logic\n     of correspondence between material and social contrasts,\n     production is thus the reproduction of culture in a system\n     of objects.\n\n      At least two related modes of symbolic praxis, as it were, follow\nfrom this cultural problematic. There is, first, the analytical task\nof uncovering the symbolic base of capitalist production, the coding of\npeople and objects that underlies and is reproduced in production.\nSahlins himself begins this structuralist task in the book\u2019s final\nchapters by outlining symbolic accounts of the production of food\n(focusing on the cultural categorization of edible vs. inedible animals\nthat precedes the actual production of food) and of clothing (focusing\non the fact that both whole costumes as well as constituent elements\nlike line, cut, color, etc., are coded by class, sex, occupation, time-\nof-day, and spatial differentiations that themselves precede and\ndetermine what clothes are produced). In addition, though, a\nless academic mode of symbolic praxis is implied in this cultural per-\nspective on capitalist production. For if there is a relative autonomy\nto the cultural logic ordering the mode and relations of production,\nthen deliberate action aimed at transforming that logic \u2014 or at least\naimed at uncovering it and its contingency and biases and, so, delegiti-\nmizing its \"natural\" authority \u2014 may make good political sense. In\nother words, when seen as symbolic transformation that will alter the\nvery context of production, the process of changing consciousness appears\nas anything but quietistic, and the workplace becomes only one potential\nlocus for political action.\n\n"},{"uid":"JedRasula_fromPoetryintheTropicsAPoliticalHistoryofPoetics_1982","author":"Jed Rasula","shortTitle":"from Poetry in the Tropics: A Political History of Poetics","title":"Jed Rasula | from Poetry in the Tropics: A Political History of Poetics | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1982","date":1982,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":4.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEvol4\/pictures\/035.html","text":"\n                from Poetry in the Tropics: A Political History of Poetics\n\n\n\n\n            Jed Rasula\n\n\n\nThe monster of the text: that a voice has vanished like buffalo from the prairie grass, and all that\nremains is an industrialized stubble.

Not just etymology, not compacted meaning by multilingual\noverlays and transparencies and depth-charges of unpredictable magnitudes of detonation, but a\nsyntax that ripples along inside the words themselves rather than between them. To read the Wake or\nUlysses demands not a literacy of multilingual or multicultural reference, but a loose drifting of such\nliteracies as tattered ends, the attention of the normal stage-scenic phantasy brain thrown out like\nexposed wires, brushing and drawing against the rough sensation of the tongue and the rounded\nsensuous interior of the ears where aroused language fecundates and rings bells, beats on anvils, rides\nstirrups \u2014 the phantasy of scene or person or act exposed to the movement of the language as it\nturns half startled on itself and sees itself speaking behind its own back, opens its mouth in\namazement and releases its exposure-like sparks dragged out of the friction of that difference brought\nto speech and writing by the width of a man or woman's body compacted into the thin plank of the\ntongue.\n\n                                           \u2022\n\nThe old proposition that the life was the truth and the poetry was an inferior life, an 'expression of'\nor a 'representation of' that 'other' life, created an imbalance that made poems susceptible to extra-\npoetic ideologies. Allegory was its major syntactic motor. A poetry of the tropics could only finally\nidentify itself and its own condition when this familiar habit, or garment, of poetic language, was\nremoved: i.e., when the poem disrobed and the breath of its composition and the breathlessness of its\nreaderly climaxes were identical or at least occupied the same space, the same surface.\n\n\nPoetry always demonizes the impulse to understand, and leaves words as boundaries, inscriptions at\nlimits, terminal points like electrical conductors confining and utilizing barbaric energy in a context\nof precision. This is why there's always so much voodoo of the typology, the 'style' of the poem, the\nway the words buoy up a posture on the moving torque of the poem's sea-drift. Type is the literalism\nreaders treasure, identifying comprehension with an exact sign, with the scar that won't recede, the\nname that will live in the minds of men forever, and so forth.\n\n                                          \u2022\n\nA text is shot full of holes. A breath roams around in there, offering its windpipe, its hole where\ntexture gushes or where meaning drains away. The poem's only permanence is its zone of crossings,\nits types which melt and decompose in the compost of the poem. That compost is a topos which is\ntropical, the place of poetry, and the de-composition of the poem is where and how it twists its other\ndemonic meanings in the reader's mouth as a palpable ventriloquism. How it turns around\nunintended obverses of the types the poem presents. How the poem's action, like the 'action' of a\nrevolver, is a continual discharge in the total body-mass of whose mixtures certain things are only\npartially seen. And this persistence in willing a partial seeing, which is an encompassing of the\ncontinually-missing, lacking, invisible or uninterpretable \u2014 this partiality of the object to seem to\nhave another side, is the margin at which poems slice off so decisively from prose, which promises\nthat all it wants to deal with will be forthcoming in a linear motion, and will have nothing to do with\nthe adjacencies, peripheries, perimeters and textual boundaries which poems by nature adhere to as\nresidual graffiti.\n\n                                          \u2022\n\nAt the level of the infinitely small, perception and cognition are constantly rethought into prehuman\nforms, as if language itself preceded the human and in the history of which people were an\ninterruption, arrogantly trying to possess and utilize and profit from their speech. In a work like \u2018A\u2019\nthere is no thinking but rather a remarkable condensation of wisdom. It proposes a poetics of\ncondensation and density. And the effort in reading it would be to attain a vista looking out over the\npre-views of language, the pre-human ability of language to generate specifically human abilities, a\nprospect in which articulation awakens in the mouth or hand only through a nourishment which\nvigorously distills the speech, burning its energy instantly back into humus, ground, base.

Where in earlier\nsocieties the artistic activity was directed to socially regulated func-\ntions of a group such as performative situations or practical gestures\nfor public and semi-public occasions \u2014 today the compelling basis of\nwriting begins at a point of alienation from any socially explicit occa-\nsion. Which fosters the link with reading \u2014 that now, writers are readers\nfirst and their isolateness maintains them even against their will as such.\nThe only clear \"writers\u201d would be those putting their work directly into\nmarket, working on a deadline, a definitive readership standing by to man\nthe reading-boats. Writers without such an immediate market are in the\ndamning circumstance, more often than not, of trying to insist on them-\nselves as not readers, against all odds, in service of the fetish of\noriginality. So the task is now to move towards a more affirmative stance\n\n\nas readers, to make of the act of reading the art that it in fact is.\nREADING IS TRADITIONALLY THE MOST NEGLECTED OF ALL ARTS. Because it\u2019s the\nmost abused. The psychological struggle that should concern us is not\nthat of individual writers overcoming \"the burden of the past\u201d (Bate,\nBloom) but individual readers overcoming the burden of the present, which\nis to view reading as a fallen, passive, irresponsible but entertaining\nstate. This is the reader-as-junkie. What presently seems to count among\nwriters is that the writing be psychologically valuable to the writer, but\nthis is simply to increase the hold solipsism always wants to maintain on\nus. The corrmmality of the reading\/writing circuit is composed entirely\nof readers, not writers. If all writing were to cease right now, the\nfantastic load of the already-written would be more than sufficient to\nsponsor a new race of genius speakers and rhetoricians and conversationa-\nlists. I think we\u2019re at a point where we can actually say (probably we\u2019re\nthe first people in history to get to this point) that there exists enough\nwriting already. To affirm one\u2019s position as a reader is to pronounce\noneself willing to work with other people rather than work for them.\nAlways this haunting sense, that in writing you\u2019re doing somebody else a\nbig favor, while reading is just a solitary unrelated selfish act. A per-\nspective we\u2019ve got to understand is writing as a selfish indulgence in the\nnotion of originality. Originality, while not a useless word by any means,\nis profoundly artificial. Insofar as the \"original\" writer becomes the\naristocratic dispenser of trinkets, originality has got to go. To be a\nreader is not to be unoriginal, not to be a primitive under instruction of\nthe civilized author, not to be a castrated writer. To be a reader is to\nbe the willing receptor of transformative agencies destined to either\nalter or confirm one\u2019s position in a social circuitry. To take this on as\nresponsibility is to be willing to regulate one\u2019s Desire as an individual\nenergy occurring within a social field. To persist in the writerly fantasy\nof originality is to succumb to the hideous fantasy of reproduction without\nsex. This is all becoming too familiar to be true, or is it? A \"personal\nnecessity\" that tries to mesmerize everybody into keeping their distance,\ndoing their \"thing\u201d, and hoard their fantastic experience of reading in\ntheir private strongbox of thought, is no longer necessary. My hope is\nthat we\u2019ll come to be less willing to confuse this with writing, and under-\nstand writing again someday as a function of repetition, of which reading\nis the clearest sensual link we have with the invisibility of Desire.\n\nJED RASULA\n\n"},{"uid":"JedRasula_TheMoneyoftheMind_1979","author":"Jed Rasula","shortTitle":"The Money of the Mind","title":"Jed Rasula | The Money of the Mind | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/037.html","text":"\nJED RASULA :\n\n\nTHE MONEY OF THE MIND\n\n(The Economy of Literature by Marc Shell, Johns Hopkins University\nPress, $10.00)\n\n\". . . why did coinage, tyranny, and philosophy develop in the same time\nand place?

What are\nthe relationships among verbal, monetary, and political representation?\"\n(p. 152)\n\n\nThese fetching questions come at the end of Shell\u2019s Economy of Literature\n\u2014 an honest placement because the book could hardly answer them in 150\npages; and in fact it functions as a kind of preparatory course for\nbringing such questions within range of intellectual audibility. The\nbook is loosely organized, consisting of largely independent chapters on:\n(1) the Gyges ring motif in Herodotus and Plato; Plato, Heraklitus and\nthe metaphor of money; (2) a history of the origins of monetary inscrip-\ntions (as a poetic language); (3) Aristotle on economy and aesthetics;_\nSophocles\u2019 Oedipus as an intensive scrutiny of the Greek homonyms teohne\n(skill), tyche (luck), teknon (son) and tokos (human offspring); (4)\nRousseau\u2019s fable of the fox and the grapes; (5) Ruskin\u2019s fascination\nwith the notion of an economy of literature. The last two chapters seem\nto be thrown into the book simply to signal the fact that occasional\nlatecomers have given thought to the relationship between poetic and\neconomic production which so vexed the Ancients. The distance between\neach of the chapters works, however, because Shell is not presenting a\nthesis but elaborating a sequence of analyses (generally philological),\ndemonstrating a way of thinking, and injecting into an imaginal realm\nthe potential for a continued alert consideration of the issues he\nraises. No thesis, but rather a phrase which declares nothing as it\nstands, diffused throughout the book: \u2019\u2019the money of the mind\u201d (Marx\u2019s\ntag for logic). This mental currency has as its project the production\nof a supplementary human \u2019\u2019nature\u201d (or, an alien order of things). As\nhe says, \u2019\u2019Philosophy and money both order the \u2019other\u2019 arts and are about\n\u2019worth\u2019 (although in different senses).\u201d (p. 25) They are not quite so\ninnocuously \u2019\u2019about\u201d, they\u2019re also of. Philosophy and money are productive\nof human natures and systems even while they attempt to retain their\nstatus as neutral regulators. Shell has made what may be the only\nsupplement to Derrida on the relationship between thinking (the money of\nthe mind) and image (the impress on the mind\u2019s coins). He literally\nexamines coins as texts (the book photographically reproduces 32 of\nthem), and he mounts his study on the myth of Gyges the slave whose king\nrequires him to watch the queen undress so he can confirm her beauty.\n\nThe queen gets wind of this, enlists Gyges\u2019 aid in killing her husband,\nand he becomes king himself. It\u2019s in his paranoid occupancy of his\nformer master\u2019s throne that he invents coinage, bureaucracy, and\nsubsequently tyrannizes the kingdom. \u2019\u2019This invisible being (an ancient\nWizard of Oz) introduces written communications to protect his position.\u201d\n(p. 18) \"Written communications\u201d = coins, tests, philosophy (or\nconvertable mental currency). \"The development of a bureaucracy\nsupposes two fundamental social conditions: the development of forms of\nsymbolization, such as money and writing, and the relative invisibility\nof the ruler.\"\n\n     The Economy of Literature, as the title suggests, is about poetics.\nTraditionally, poetics has been obsessed with the mechanical apparition\nof the visible, the \u2019art-object\u2019, the artifact. But as Shell reminds,\n\n\n\u2019\u2019Poetics is about production (poiesis) . There can be no analysis of\nthe form or content of production without a theory of labor.\u201d (p. 9) In\nliterary theory, labor has been repressed or made invisible, and in fact\nit now comes forward to tyrannize the product, making the product (the\npoem) not the consequence of labor but the inexplicable result of a\nmagical expedition into the world of appearances (Merwin and Strand, for\ninstance, seem to fuel this mesmerized fascination). Current American\npoetry too comfortably mimics the dominant cultural ideology to produce!\nproduce! Questions of market and audience are generally only diversions\nfrom the more fundamental analysis of labor. Logic, money and tyranny\nwere united in ancient poetic theory to become a poetics of invisibility\nwhose end (to cite Aristotle) is the production of that which does not\nexist in nature rather than the just distribution of that which does.\nIn a society straining at the bit to use nuclear energy where solar\nwould do as well, such a perspective is marvellously appropriate. But\nfor Aristotle, says Shell, \u2019\u2019Poetry is a counterfeit human production as\nvexing as incest.\" (p. 101) To be counterfeit is not necessarily bad if\nthe prevailing currency supports a tyrant. In fact this would appear to\nhave been the fulcrum of successive avant-gardes. A traditional\nmotivation of poetry has indeed been a kind of linguistic incest, the\ndesire to occupy another person\u2019s words. Whenever poetry, like Gyges,\nobserves another man\u2019s wife undressing, a reactionary diplomacy sets in\nlike a virus: mind mints money, minces words, and poetry refuses to\nacknowledge the nature of the labor that produced it and the community\nof laborers within which it has to exist. Criticism stops being a\npoetics (i.e. \"about production\") and becomes instead an alternative\ncurrency (which tries to work out an exchange value with poetry on a\nstrictly commodity level). Shell\u2019s book is a useful challenge to\nlanguage-thought-full poets, because in practice as well as theory an\noverdeveloped attention to language can make it, too, a commodity\nsubject to the tyranny of\u2014\"X\" (which, like the sphynx\u2019s riddle, has\ntwo arms, two legs, and forges signatures).\n\n\n\n\n"},{"uid":"KitRobinson_ArmantroutExtremities3Views_1979","author":"Kit Robinson","shortTitle":"Armantrout: Extremities (3 Views)","title":"Kit Robinson | Armantrout: Extremities (3 Views) | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn7\/pictures\/017.html","text":"\n\nAn eternal, singly framed.

In place of a\n     primitive \"order of custom,\" he confronts the \"stony law\" & \"cruel\n     commands\" Blake wrote of\u2014\"the hand of jealousy among the flaming hair.\"\n     Still he confirms, with Gary Snyder, the presence of a \"Great Subculture\n     ... of Illuminati\" within the higher civilizations, an alternative tra-\n     dition or series of traditions hidden sometimes at the heart of the\n     established order, & a poetry grudgingly granted its \"license\" to resist.\n     No minor channel, it is the poetic mainstream that he finds here: magic,\n     myth & dream; earth, nature, orgy, love; the female presence the Jewish\n     poets named Shekinah....:\n\n          ... the female, the proletariat, the foreign; the animal and\n          vegetative; the unconscious and the unknown; the criminal and\n          failure\u2014all that has been outcast and vagabond must return\n          to be admitted in the creation of what we consider we are.\n\n\n          In the Jewish instance--as my own \"main main\"\u2014I can now see, no\n     longer faintly, a tradition of poesis that goes from the interdicted\n     shamans (= witches, sorcerers, etc., in the English bible) to the prophets\n     & apocalyptists (later \"seers\" who denied their sources in their shaman\n     predecessors) & from there to the merkaba & kabbala mystics, on the right\n     hand, & the gnostic heretics & nihilistic messiahs, on the left....\n\n\n   This follows roughly the stages (torah, mishnah, kabbala, magic & folk-\n  lore, etc.) by which the \"oral tradition\" (\"torah of the mouth\") was\n  narrowed & superceded by the written. But not without resistance; says\n  the Zohar: \"The Voice should never be separated from the Utterance, & he\n  who separates them becomes dumb being bereft of speech, returns to\n  dust.\" An ongoing concern here....\n\n   COMMENTARY: Gematria is the general term for a variety of traditional\n  .coding practices used to establish correspondences between words or series\n  of words based on the numberical equivalence of the sums of their letters\n  or on the interchange of letters according to a set system.... (While\n  numerical gematria & letter-coded temurah come easily in a language like\n  Hebrew which is written without vowels, the possibility of similar\n  workings in English shouldn\u2019t be discounted.) The numerical method\u2014\n  gematria per so\u2014typically took aleph as one, beth as two, yod as ten,\n  kuf as 100, etc., through tav (last letter) as 400\u2014although more\n  complicated methods (e.g., reduction to single digits, etc.) were later\n  introduced. Non-numerical methods included (1) anagrams, or rearrange-\n  ments of the letters of a word to form a new word or word series, as \"god\"\n  to \"dog\" in English; (2) notarikon, the derivation of a new word from the\n  initial letters of several others & vice versa, as \"god,\" say from\n  \"garden of delight\"; & (3) temurah, various systems of letter code, e.g.,\n  the common one in which the first half of the alphabet is placed over the\n  second & letters are substituted between the resultant rows, etc., in\n  search of meaningful combinations.\n\n        Processes of this kind go back to Greek, even Babylonian, practice,\n  & early enter the rabbinic literature. But the greatest development was\n  among kabbalists from the 12th century on, who used it both to discover\n  divine & angelic names & to uncover correspondences between ideas & images\n  by means free of subjective interference. When set out as poems, the\n  resemblance of the gematria to a poetry of correspondences in our own time\n  is evident, as also to instances of process poetry & art based on (more\n  or less) mechanical formulas for the generation of both simply & extended\n  series of permutations & combinations....\n\nTHE BODY    NOTHING LIGHT      HE & HE     \nThe reward.

I used to do them in my head because no\ncompendium, no gathering was available to help me map the territory that\nwas opening up to us. As a kid I inherited a large desk with a sheet of\nglass on top, beneath which I would slip in pages of poems\u2014my own &\nothers\u2019\u2014& pictures, etc. that I had been coming across in the stuff I\nwas reading. I used to arrange them to form \u2019\u2019shows\u201d of works that seemed,\nby juxtaposition, to inform each other. I also typed up poems from dif-\nferent places & times & kept them in a series of folders marked anthology.\n\n\nThat was from high school days & stopped sometime in college, when I\nstarted to buy books & be deceived by other people\u2019s arrangements.\n\n    When I reawakened in the later 1950s I discovered Blake saying: \"I\nmust either create my own \u2019system\u2019 or be trapped in another\u2019s\u201d\u2014for which\nyou might substitute the word \u2019\u2019anthology.\u201d (The danger of being trapped\nin your own system as well is more subtle but nohow out of the picture.)\nI got quickly into doing my own press (Hawk\u2019s Well) & magazine (Poems\nfrom the Floating World). But the magazine was really an anthology & I\nsubtitled it, in my mind at least, \u201dan ongoing anthology of the deep\nimage.\" In it I brought together contemporary work with work from else-\nwhere that I felt was along the same track. The idea was that we weren\u2019t\ndoing something new (which we were) but were getting back in our own\nterms to fundamental ways of seeing & languaging from which we (the\nlarger \u201dwe\u201d of the western enterprise) had long been cut off.\n\n    I otherwise dislike anthologies\u2014the ones, I mean, that perpetuate\nthe orders of a limited past & by so doing hold back the real work of\nthe present. On the whole I feel better about the kind of anthology that\npresents a new move in poetry, like a well conceived magazine or like a\ngroup show in the visual arts. But, except for the contemporary side of\nAmerica a Prophecy, I haven\u2019t felt myself pulled in that direction either\nbut remain distrustful of the rigidities & career tactics implicit in the\nform. My own concern has been with interpretations of past & present\u2014\nthe present foremost but not sufficient in itself. In other words I\u2019ve\nlooked for a way of measuring our works & selves against the possibili-\nties of a poetics that\u2019s big enough to account for human creativity,\nhuman language-making over the broadest span available. I have an idea\nof history\u2014or a feel for it\u2014that guides me & that changes in the\nprocess of pulling it together.\n\n    David Antin describes me (both in the anthologies & in poems like\nPoland\/1931) as \u2019\u2019walking backwards .. . moving away from the things that\nhe\u2019s leaving ... but keeping his eyes on them while backing toward the\nnew terrain, which I suppose he only sees directly when it joins the rest\nbehind him.\u201d The perspective, which seems true enough to my experience\n(if you add a little forward twisting of the head from time to time), led\nme (with hints from predecessors like Tzara & others) to the discovery\nof lines between past & present, lines overlooked before that transmitted\na crypto-tradition (or series of such) throughout the world. The lines\nled from poem to poem like strings of light\u2014from past to present or,\nwhen I turned my head, from present to past. What I saw as poetry was\nconditioned by what we make as poetry today. The question invariably\ncomes up: why are those sounds in the Navajo chant taken as a \u2019\u2019poem\"?\nAnd the answer: because Hugo Ball or Kurt Schwitters (or you name them)\nopened that domain for us. But when they did they also pointed to a\npossible human continuity that had been broken or at least obscured: a\nnon-semantic form of utterance to which they were now calling our atten-\n\n\ntion. I have, in taking a look for myself, only continued the process,\nmaybe made some of it more overt.\n\n    For this, \"anthology\" seemed like a terrific instrument, as a means\nfor exploring & keeping before us the dimensions of our humanness--even\nwhere our explorations lead us to a language seemingly devoid of meanings.\nI was drawn first to a search for instances (\"primitive\" & \"archaic\") of\nwhat was, what seemed\u2014if anything\u2014an overly meaning-full area of mind:\nthe world of \"images,\" of what James Hillman more recently speaks of as\nthe \"royal road of soul-making\" (Keats\u2019 term), or image-making, where\n\"to \u2019be in soul\u2019 is to experience the fantasy in all realities & the\nbasic reality of fantasy.\" I knew it would be there & I sighted it: the\nmultiple ways it shows up under the turns & twists of the particular\ncultures that attend to it.\n\n    Yet once I was into Technicians of the Sacred, the discoveries\nexpanded in the process of searching them out. In particular I began to\nassemble\u2014under section titles like \"A Book of Extensions\" & \"A Book of\nEvents\"\u2014works that were different from but strangely like* our own exper-\niments with language, structure & performance. In 1964 I had started a\ngroup of my own pared-down quasi-minimal pieces called \"Sightings\" that\ndidn\u2019t need more than a word or two to be operative:\n\nCages (i)             Cages_ (iv)          Cages (vii)                \nWires.

And a third thing, which I would be less than honest to\ndisguise\u2014that I\u2019ve felt (in maybe all the anthologies but Revolution of\nthe Word) a sense of the book as a poem, a large composition operating\nby assemblage or collage: my own voice emerging sometimes as translator,\nsometimes as commentator, but still obedient to the other voices, whether\n\"out there\" or \"in here.\" In A Big Jewish Book I\u2019ve carried it (or it\u2019s\ncarried me) the furthest: a bigger space & less \"my own\" than Poland\/\n1931, say, in which I was likewise using procedures like assemblage. The\nrange (unlike Poland) is the totality of the imaginably \"Jewish,\" both\ndiscovered & invented; & the collages & commentaries are more varied &\npersonal & run right through the book (not reserved for a special section\nonly). That follows, I suppose, from the assumption that my own partici-\npation here is clearer\u2014at least different\u2014than in Pumpkin or Technicians.\n\n    The space is big enough to do it all, but in the end it isn\u2019t the\nidea of (so-called) \"Jewishness\u201d that most concerns me\u2014rather a specific\nset of language plays, feats of word magic & language-centeredness (in\nits most profound sense) that come to a visible point within the illusion\nof the ethnically specific (the Indian in Shaking the Pumpkin, the Jewish\nhere, etc.). What it brings me to in this one (the third of the volumes\nresponding to ethnos) is a place where I can deal with the grapheme, the\nwritten word & image as such, which seems suddenly to be as primal as\nspeech is\u2014in the sense that all language doings are present in our first\nemergences as human beings. Or, as I quote Jabfes there: \"The book is as\nold as water & fire.\"\n\n    Having gotten that far, I can now go back to the worlds of Technicians\n& Pumpkin & find it there also, can play with what intrigues me most in\nDerrida, that wild statement that \"no reality or concept would correspond\nto the expression \u2019society without writing.\u201d\u2019 The issue, then, has\n\n\nalways been language\u2014language & reality, nothing else\u2014& the dichotomy\nof speaking & writing is, if no further specified, another con to keep\nus from our wholeness. Concerns like that\u2014of language & wholeness\u2014\nwould seem to hold the work together; at least if you want a sense of\nwhere I\u2019m going.\n\nJEROME ROTHENBERG\n\n\n\nROTHENBERG ANTHOLOGIES BIBLIOGRAPHY: Technicians of the Sacred:\nA Range of Poetries from Africa^ America^ Asia^ & Oceania (1968).\n\nShaking the Pumpkin: Traditional Poetry of the Indian North Americas\n(1972).

A\nlarge table beside it very carefully and a puzzle emphasizing arrangements of energy for new ideas and\nthen the creation which slowly drifts through the room explains he had discovered that it quickly\nconceives of an assertion of the same place with a perspective that suddenly looks like it came from an\nexamination of attention that wanted to become known as a fable. Appearances apparently had been\na sensation.

For the individual it can sanely mean only \"poem-writer\":\n\"... his writings make him a poet, not his acting of the role,\" Frank\nO\u2019Hara wrote\u2014not that there\u2019s any role to act anymore, so the choice\nisn\u2019t so noble. The only true choice I see (after rejecting out of hand\nthe ways of the academy) is in how to think about it\u2014whether to see\noneself as a member of a little tribe of atavists or band of subversives,\non the one hand, or really completely alone and slipping through the\ninterstices of the world, on the other. I aspire to think the latter way,\nwhich has the advantage of opening on the most nearly total freedom.\nAdmittedly, it is also close to thinking nothing at all.\n\n\n    It is, with all due modern irony, the course of the Sublime. The\neconomic and, outside its craft-ghettos, the social insubstantiality of\npoetry may be fecund if, looking them in the eye, one continues to take\npoetry seriously. There is a certain light-heartedness in this, as in\ncontemplating the present world \u2014 for instance, that it is inhabited now\nby 4 billion or so of us humans\u2014and in treating one\u2019s individual life,\na thing of no consequence, seriously nonetheless. Now, the Sublime is a\nthought you can make nothing of\u2089 which is the point. It\u2019s an escape from\nthe toils of any other thought, any minor seriousness\u2014and that would\ninclude all attempts to justify the vocation of poetry. It is precisely\nin being unjustifiable in present \"real\" terms\u2014meaningless in relation\nto the minor seriousness of a given social order \u2014 that poetry may have\nsomething\u2014some deep, funny, surprising consolations\u2014to offer.\n\n    This is why poet clannishness distresses me: people just throwing\naway their one and only significant advantage in rites of terminal petti-\nness and boredom. That advantage is a detachment, and a stamina, for the\nhighest existential fun\u2014licensed irresponsibility of thought. What\ncould be better?

Later this possibility defined itself\nclearly for me.\n\n     Until now the literary innovations of Marinetti and the other Futur-\nist poets used more or less the conventional typographical characters, as\nwell as mathematical symbols, arranging them according to emotional laws.\n\n\n     One would have thought this was a basic innovation, when in fact it\nwas only partial, and more apparent than real.\n\n     If we want to express a new realism which is a synthesis of our\ntime, we must create a new lyricism, expressed with new tools, forged\nfrom A to Z and entirely different from those used until now.\n\n     We, the painters, destroyed painting a long time ago (painting as\nit was known from the Renaissance to our time). Now it is time for you,\npoets and writers, to destroy literature.\n\n     We must renew our tools, forge new ones which correspond to our\nneeds.\n\n     Hence in your domain you must enlarge your means; that is, add new\ncharacters or new typographical expressions to those already in use, to\nsuit the need for a synthesis of the absolute realism which is our goal.\n\n     I\u2019m not thinking of any new pictorial system : we mustn\u2019t confuse\nimages and appearances, the representation of ideas and the representa-\ntion of forms.\n\n     Until now, written literature has used the same sounds as the spok-\nen language, which is where I think it errs. Since the realism we seek\nis never separated from external reality to the point where it no longer\nhas anything to do with it, we will have to find special signs to ex-\npress this realism, signs totally invented and accepted as conventions,\nand which will express not an act, for example the fact of running\n(exterior life), but the idea of running (interior life).\n\n     When I say idea I do not mean it in the sense of appearance; for\nthat one need merely depict two legs in the process of running.\n\n     The idea of running is in fact much greater than the appearance\nof the running. The idea is limitless, universal.\n\n     It is commonly known that the first written language was with pic-\ntures. To communicate, one drew an animal, an object, a being or what-\never. This process led not only to a generalization of the idea, but\nalso, to a formal expression, better suited to express a universal con-\ncept than a practical need.\n\n     In time, these methods of expression for our way of life were per-\nfected, and now we must put them aside to find methods of expression\nfor our art. By that I don\u2019t mean we should go back to writing with\npictures, although this barbaric medium is extremely attractive and it\nis impossible to renovate without becoming barbaric again, even unwill-\ningly. Even then this self-expression through signs representing\nobjects would become a sort of symbolic writing.\n\n     The method of using new methods of synthetic lyricism to express\nthe intense realism of our emotions was suggested to me fr* my drawing\n\"parolibero\" in which I voluntarily associated closed forms and acute\nangles with particular words, round shapes or obtuse angles with other\nwords.\n\n     Just as we have colors and shapes in painting which synthesize,\nfor example, all of spring, or simply joy, or warmth, etc., we also\n\n\nFormes qui ne repr\u00e9sent pas une danseuse en mouvement, mais le mouvement\nen tant que sensation dynamique elle-m\u00eame (1913)\n\n\n have in literature methods which reunite groups of lyric elements, or\ndynamic literary continuations.\n\n      For instance, in \"parolibero\", the drawing in question, the sensa-\ntions of luminous penetration in the two electric searchlights, to which\nare associated the penetration of two Mauser bullets as they whiz\nthrough space, are rendered by the contrast of two acute angles meeting\nat their tips.\n\n      Every analogical sensation associated with the idea of brutal pene-\ntration can be rendered by two acute angles.\n\n      In this same area of the drawing, for the onomatopoeia szszszszsz...\nexpressing the whizzing bullets and the violent beam of light, I had to\nwrite the letters with little dashes instead of continuous letters. For\nme these dashes had a value of intensity (quantitative), just as I ob-\ntain a plastic intensity with brush strokes using analogous colors in a\nshape. To carry this intuition even further we need to construct new\nsigns expressing qualitative quantities. Then these signs would become\nconventional and the work would be understood. After all, aren\u2019t num-\nbers, letters, subdivisions of time and space all conventions?\n\n      Each period should have its new conventions, or else we are all\ndoomed to simple narration. The goal of literature is to find images\nthrough words, just as that of painting is to evoke appearances through\nshapes.\n\n      Obviously it would be impossible to read the words of this new\nlyricism, but can we read paintings, can the musician read a symphony,\ncan we read the song of a bird?\n\n      The new lyrical work will evoke universal ideas and not the sounds\nof spoken language. We leave these sounds to lawyers (the art of ora-\ntory) and to entertainers.\n\n      Besides, isn\u2019t it another convention to describe as sound those\nsensations, registered by the ear, of a hammer noise?\n\n      Currently, with the laws of simultaneity which we have discovered\nin ourselves, this word sound has become meaningless, whereas the parti-\ncular sensation evoked in us by hammer blows can determine in our sensi-\nbility groups of analogical ideas (and for a painter groups of appear-\nances) which bear no resemblance to the sound, nor with the wham-wham\nimpressionistic expression of this sound. This is how I foresee the\npossibility of creating a new ideography , to be a geometric graphic\nexpression of universal ideas.\n\n      My intuition is naturally based on the concept of the absolute\ndynamism of matter, a dynamism which can be expressed geometrically, as\nin painting, but without designating its limits.\n\n\n                                                     GINO SEVERINI"},{"uid":"GailSher_AnExorcismofRepresentationalLanguage_1980","author":"Gail Sher","shortTitle":"An Exorcism of Representational Language","title":"Gail Sher | An Exorcism of Representational Language | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/009.html","text":"\nAN EXORCISM OF REPRESENTATIONAL LANGUAGE\n\nBEAU BEAUSOLEIL, Red Light with Blue Sky (1979; Matrix Press, P.O. Box\n327, Palo Alto, CA 94302; $5)\n\n\nWell now if we are going to talk about reading Beau Beausoleil\u2019s poetry\n\n\nwe are in for something one could say both possible and impossible by\nwhich I mean that insofar as his vision occurs before imagination and\nhis language does not represent his poems may be more accurately spoken\nof as reading us his words (as in \"Nothing\") speak us the poem is not\nwhat it\u2019s about. Here words are not because of their capacity to have\nmeaning. Here words are meaning. They are all by themselves conclusive\njust like holes are conclusive. Four times in the same short poem for\nexample he\u2019ll say \"she said\" and you think \"she said so what\" but \"she\nsaid\" is very much what. The logic of \"she said\" is the nature of lan-\nguage itself. We like to think that words mean something. We like to\nthink that when we use a word it carries with it a raft of significances\nwhich to the extent that we are verbal we to a greater or lesser degree\nshare and the friction of this expectation against lack of meaning in\nthe usual sense allows (and this is what is at the root of poetry\nactually) a deeper understanding to dawn....\n\nAnd so felt language. Words speak in their enormous palpability (\"hun-\ndreds of shoes\" \"hundreds of trucks\" \"beast of fact\" \"shellfish\" \"teeth\"\nand \"gleaming\" one of his few adjectives) but this indisputable concreteness\nturns out the fool of substantiality and serves rather as a guise (\"Got\nUp\") to an ultimate ungraspableness. \"Try it on here\" he says and all\nhis poems make this request. His intimacy is tangible but like \"the\nthought on her fingers\" (a gesture of trust that allows us to enter a\nplace of matured pain) it is one we can\u2019t really touch....\n\nAs you read you become aware of logical (syllogistic?) and mathematical\nterms (\"The numerical appears\/across everything\") signifying conclusions\nultimately not deducible. \"Day times day\" and you hear equals. Any-\nthing times anything has always equaled something. You are ripe for a\nresolution. The nature of the language practically promises a resolution\nwhich does happen it does indeed happen but not in a way you can assess.\nThe kind of figures he uses \"The long division\/from the day\") don\u2019t add\nup by our usual methods of reckoning. The poem ends. Something has\nbeen settled but what and the nature of the settling have more to do\nwith the movement of numbers their abstraction and concreteness their\nopening and falling into new configurations their way of making their\nown particular (things by some sense mathematical? logic accumulate\nmore than the sum of their parts) sense. I use this again as an example\nof his gentleness as by making us so very ready this vocabulary prepares\nfor a solution or conclusion which only under circumstances of such\nreadiness would we be available for. For the solution or conclusion\nwhich does come comes (like life itself) in realms (just is) we cannot\nname....\n\nThe language leaves no trace (though there is something so familiar)\nand as it proceeds there is just the process and you are suspended in\nthe motion of it (sometimes as in \"Wouldn\u2019t You\" with discontinuous or\n\nas in \"Nothing\" internal motion)'without there being anything by which\nto hang on or let go. Sometimes (\"Skyline\") there is a failure even to\ncreate a negative. You ride the passion you ride and you ride you float\nyou want so much what is almost. There is almost something you feel it\nyou stretch for it and though you can\u2019t reach it quite the stretching\nopens you and deepens what you feel so that you take in more (\"the\nthirst\/above the\/glass\") than if you did. Almost becomes an invitation\nand at the same time an entrance to what finally gives itself up to\nanother (\"she made that\/say that\/all she\/hurt\") kind of name.\n\nGAIL SHER\n"},{"uid":"JamesSherry_AB_1979","author":"James Sherry","shortTitle":"A,B,$.","title":"James Sherry | A,B,$. | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1979","date":1979,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":2.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn9\/pictures\/041.html","text":"\n\nJAMES SHERRY :\n\nA,B,$.\n\nThe Ground: Looking closely at words increases their materiality\u2014\nCurves of letters, repetitions of shapes and phrases and sounds. That\nand the materiality of discourse, definitions that turn back on them-\nselves (\u2019\u2019contagious hospital\u201d is the famous example) begin to generate\nnew meanings. Yet since the 18th century, the tendency toward standard-\n\n\nization of spelling, capitalization and punctuation as well as revolu-\ntionary content (Romanticism), more and more, has forced language into\nthe service of the subject and the idea. Common usage usually allows one\nto see through the words to the meaning, intention or subject: \"Pass the\nbutter, please.\", but why should literature, writing that is in the first\ninstance writing, be instrumental, in the service of...? Value is not\ninherent in language any more than it is in commodities. All value is\nattached as exchange value or use value. Why should language have only\nexchange value? Yes, exchange language for butter, if that is the goal,\nbut if writing is the goal, a more specialized use value must be at\nleast a possibility. Is language always a commodity? Clearly not in\nthe case when blank paper costs money and a poem put on it cannot be\ngiven away. So, consider the possibility of meaning that is not seen\nthrough language, but meaning that is embedded, as it is put on the page,\nin language. But the main concern is not instrumentality, but to ques-\ntion what use we expect from writing. Whatever we develop is going to\nbe misused.\n\nLanguage Models \u2014 Industrial Conglomerates and Fetishism of Structure:\nSuppliers take control over demand and manufacturers, with the aid of\ntransparent language (A lot to live, Ajax cleans), control demand merely\nby producing and selling. But traditional divisions of industrial\nproduction by product disappear, and, although we still say razor blades\nplease, the company that makes the blades is a tobacco company, and what\ncontrols that company is not a person who is expert in either tobacco or\nrazor blades, but rather a manager who creates groupings of industries\nand contrives to disrupt the flow of other companys\u2019 profits or supply\nso he can step in at the last moment and append a real estate firm to\nhis empire. What is the underlying organization that makes the company\nmore resilient to the vagaries of the economy, nature and other\u2019s\npredatory instincts? Japan might be a model and a warning to those who\ndo not need to be convinced. Although conglomerates are not organized\naround the commodities they produce, they still exist for two purposes \u2014\nfor profit and to maintain those in power in power. The literature often\nreferred to on these pages does not exist for the purpose of critique,\nbut because it elucidates our concerns: it has to be written because\nthere is no other literature that can be so-called now.\n\nChange Models \u2014 Humanism?; So language, the chief and continuous commu-\nnal endeavor of the species, must be an agent of its change. If I am\ndissatisfied, I look to language to soothe my wounds and change my\nattitudes. I tell myself... Not only language, but language used\nfittedly. (Polemics are another transparency. Sometimes more is needed.)\nFittedness used: Attitudes are revealed in the way one says change takes\nplace. To say \"the order must be changed\" has a different implicit\nattitude than \"the order is changing\" or fatalistically that \"order will\nchange.\" Attitudes are revealed in the tense as much as in generalized\n\n\nlanguage \u2019\u2019views\u201d. A new idea is an agent of change, but only incident-\nally revolutionary. Language glorifies, gratifies, indulges, elucidates.\nThe choices we make on that level reveal attitudes and expose the struc-\ntures of the system. Shall we take a polemical stance or try to uncover\nmore? Because \u2019\u2019Commodities... are functions of the human organism,\u201d even\nmaterialized language use or structured language use or sincere language\nuse will be commoditized. Even non-instrumentality is an unreachable\ngoal if writing is to be comprehensible. (Non-instrumentality is an\nasymptote.)\n\nAvant-garde as Commodity: Standard patterns of syntax refer to the way\nthings used to be. New patterns reveal the present. Any other per-\nception of the relationship between style and change is alienated. Old\nideas show that not everything is changing at the same rate. The most\navant-garde barely keeps up with everyday life. \u201dIn the future we will\nbe freer, because the most advanced writing is more free of the referent\nthan past writing\u201d or \u201dWe are freer, not than we were, but because how\nour newest work indicates what freedom is.\u201d The former is a commodi-\ntized and alienated view of \u2019\u2019language\u201d writing. The contrary of it is\nequally alienated, but the second statement might be some help. (While\nwe do it, we get...) The point is not only how the elements of the\nsocial structure are revealed in language, but the attitude we ourselves\ntake toward that social-economic structure as writers. We do not need\nto strike poses or attitudinize. Our works are our attitudes and expec-\ntations. What are those three.\n\nAnother Example: Wittgenstein says, \u2019\u2019When we speak of a thing, but\nthere is no object that we can point to, there we may say is the spirit.\u201d\nIf I reply that \u2019\u2019language\u201d writing is more spiritual and instrumental\n(\u2019\u2019subjective\u201d) writing is mechanistic and technical, I missed the point\nof this article. The philosopher\u2019s words reveal a way to speak to the\nspiritual. This goes for poets and their critics.\n\n\n"},{"uid":"JamesSherry_ACollect_1978","author":"James Sherry","shortTitle":"A Collect","title":"James Sherry | A Collect | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn5\/pictures\/022.html","text":"\n\nA COLLECT\n\nCurtis Faville, Stanzas _fo_r an Evening Out (1978; L Publications; c\/o\nSerendipity Books, 1790 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94707; $4)\n\n     Before finishing ten pages of Stanzas for an Evening Out^ \"I think\nmovingly\u201d about image or line or Williams, or going over old ground\u2014I\ncan just enjoy the \u201daluminum airfoils\u201d can\u2019t I?

This follows logically from the assumption that language has no built-in, permanent\nstructure or rhetoric, but that as material it absorbs or reflects the use to which it is put in both\nhistorical and conceptual frames: not that language is subjective, but that it has properties that allow\nit to be shaped for use.\n\n        Only the alienation of modernism, with its increasingly reductive solutions, has applied to\nwords the tests of solids \u2014 warping the matter by stretching, compressing and other topological\naggressions; murder; anthropomorphizing the words themselves \u2014 as if the shapes the liquid ink\ndried to were in Marxist terms, or implicitly, or ergo, social objects. That words in many\ncontemporary settings achieve fetish status is not to be denied, but that there is a social structure\nembossed on language that indicts a ruling class or attitude pushes the point. The only workable\nindictment of the ruling class is the oppressive nature of its actions. Writers attacking that oppression\ndirectly risk jail or co-option, but writers trying to direct language structures for more distant ends\nare ignored or merely supported, because by attacking oppression at such a remove from the effects of\nthat oppression, they are seen as agents of change working within the system of ruling class\noppression.\n\n        Indeed, to what extent does it make sense to ask if the sentence, for example, or, in the\nbroader sense, if normative grammar is repressive? Since the ability to question the repressiveness of\ngrammar is possible within normative grammar, in so doing we cannot fully reject or completely\nquestion its justification, because we have accepted its domain for the discourse. Instead we must\nquestion normative grammar's limits, its edges, that is, how 'incorrect' usage becomes acceptable.\n\n        There are two contexts for this question. Are the political implications of language structures\nthe motivation for seeking a new formula or several new methods of grammatical construction? Or is\nthe need for a broader kind of grammar called for by the thoughts to which that grammar is applied\nand which that grammar\u2019s structure implies for its social context. In other words, are the reasons that\ncall for extended possibilities internal or external to writing?\n\n        The political context is, when applied to language structure, primarily a conceit. How can we\nlimit the reference of grammatical structures to the rhetoric of a political economy beyond using it as\na metaphor or framework for thinking? Certainly when the teacher says you have to do it this way, or\nthe publishing industry says you can't write that way, because it's not correct (read saleable), the\nquestion of political economy's relation to grammar is presented head on. Further, when language is\n\n\nviewed as reflective of social norms or the values of political institutions, a writer might be moved to\nchange those norms, institutions and values by changing the language that is used to run them and\ndefine their activities. But it is also vital for us as creators and users of language not to have that\ncreation and use stem solely from a reactive point of view. This is both an ethical stance and a\npractical one. Can we assert a more generative or additive attitude? Since our writing in a particular\nway determines our identity as much as the language of political institutions affects their identities,\nwhat figuration can we aspire to? These questions do not need to be answered; there is no conclusion,\nbut they need to be posed in order that our attitudes can open outward in the same way as we expect\ngrammar to open to new possibilities.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe forms of sentences as they began to be codified during the 18th century related, it seems sensible\nto say, in some central way to the patterns of thought that were to be put into those sentences. The\nshapes of phrases, clauses and sentences paralleled the way ideas were being expressed in English at\nthat time. We have ample evidence that a more open kind of capitalization, spelling, etc. was present\nin the 18th century and its uses are manifest throughout as late a work as the Prophetic Books of\nBlake. There is even the famous controversy over Emily Dickinson's use of em dashes that editors\ndeleted from her work. These kinds of facts lead us to suspect manipulation for political, if\nindividual, motives.\n\n          On the other hand, the need to assert more control over grammar in order to simplify it has\nbeen useful for the movement toward increased literacy. It is, of course, suspect to imply that if it's\nfor the 'people', it's got to be simple; nor is it necessary to restrict grammatical constructions in order\nto simplify. One can argue the presence of an elitist grammar that has sharply defined standards of\ncorrectness and a common grammar that is more open and simple. But that possibility was rejected as\na policy by the liberals who constructed the democratic constitutions of America and Europe. In\nChina there have been several layers of writing from Mandarin \u2018grass\u2019 script on down, but recent\npolitical events have implemented a restricted series of ideograms for popular use and it would be\npolitically unwise for writers to do otherwise than limit themselves to that series of ideograms in the\nnew China. The political question cuts right and left; it is not clear that the repression of the\nintellectual cadre is for the benefit of the proletariat. These selected details show how a political\nanalysis of the question is more complex than it has to be to create a reason for a given solution.\nWhat is right or left, what elitist or populist? But how can the need for an expanded grammar be\ndescribed if not in political terms?\n\n          Thought, emerging from medieval forms, restricted by an increasingly formalized normative\ngrammar, has become more complex. Synchronic time scales and a pointillistic view of the sensible\nworld and the world of ideas give thought so much more breadth and presents that thought on so\n\n\nmany simultaneous tracks, when coupled with new discoveries, that the sentence cannot contain it.\nThis new range of thought makes normative grammar a special case of possible grammars, the\nsentence a special case of possible forms a thought could take, normative syntax a special case of\npossible syntaxes. These special cases are not illegible; they have particular uses.\n\n         When readers complain they want entertainment (reading requires such open attention \u2014\nread it slower, I answer, read it again), they often are asking for a reinforcement of the restrictiveness\nof grammar. Is it reassurance they want...? The activity of thought through the three-stroke graphic\ncombustion of letters must balance and intensify the grammar to make the thought that is in a given\nsentence meaningful. Not that classical grammar doesn't do that, but we can't really see how it does\nit anymore, because the relations between the thoughts in a sentence and the presence of the sentence\nitself are so hinged to our assumptions about thinking that the relationships between the thoughts\nand the sentences are lost. We need constructions that reflect our thought constructions in the same\nway as classical constructions shaped themselves around the thoughts of the 18th century. We cannot\ndescribe the sentence as repressive, but only as an oppressive presence unmitigated by an awareness of\nwhat the structure of a sentence is doing in that place and to that particular subject.\n\n         Consider this sentence by Henry James from The Golden Bowl: 'But on all the ground to\nwhich the pretension of performance by a series of exquisite laws may apply there reigns one\nsovereign truth \u2014 which decrees that, as art is nothing if not exemplary, care nothing if not active,\nfinish nothing if not consistent, the proved error is the base apologetic deed, the helpless regret is the\nbarren commentary, and \"connexions\" are employable for finer purposes than mere gaping\ncontrition.' How much more complex can he get; but what is really important about this sentence is\nhow it shows the limits of the usefulness of the sentence itself. Still, we need methods of expressing\nthe unexpected, the previously undefined and unstructured linguistic event.\n\n         My grandmother defined the problem of expectation for me when, on her 80th birthday she\ndelivered a speech entitled, 'How I First Met Miriam Eisler, Not In Person, But By Phone.' I\ncertainly would not be surprised if I carried on an entire relationship by phone, but her idea of\nconnection with a person was face to face and she expressed it in a fine sentence. My experience with\nconnections to people is fragmented, its grammar is elliptical. I cannot honestly say how I met you in\na simple and elegant sentence. Thus the fractional distillates we assert in what passes for literature.\nBut are we bound by passion or history to restructure the impulses of Seneca and Augustine into\nheavy metal? Can we find an alternative that is not panacea? The presence of writing that is\nconsidered as test or critique by the writers themselves signals the end of such writing. Only until the\nidea is formulated does it retain validity for the literary artist. The desire to constantly recreate the\nparadigms is a form of religiosity that the 'skeptical' have adopted in lieu of less 'sophisticated' forms\nof devotion. We cannot continue to imagine ourselves in a reduced state, backed into the corner and\nfighting a political last stand.\n\n\n         'The vacancy of literature, the barrenness, is recovered from by modern methods of\nirrigation. The community to which we owe allegiance, where we hope to gain membership, is not\n'us fighting the injustice of the system' or \u2018retreating into naturalness\" but an activity of constant\ninterchange. Multiplicity in Joyce, as a literary example, is bound to history and etymology both in\nsubject and in his method of using derivations. (Neo-logisms) hardly ever get where they're able to do\nwhat is expected of them \u2014 take over a place or action that has no word of its own. So we\nreconstruct grammar and reflect and aid changing modes of thought.) The Joycean play of language\nhas given us elbow room outside the history of words not locked us into that mode. But How can we\nrecreate the world, get it, without going through the sign, its textualization, etc.\n\n         We move on from modernism to an additive art, away from painting that is white walls,\npoems that are single letters, because analysis, reductiveness, has fallen under the aegis of the law of\ndiminishing returns. Neither should we accept as credo the essentially mystic or satiric remarks of\nArtaud, et. al., on the subject of chaos. The modernists perceived chaos; they did not aspire to it. Nor\ndoes Sade assert the formality and rigidity of his sentences, but uses their restrictiveness to satirize\nlanguage structures, the fetish nature of desire and its satisfaction. On the other hand, are 'free'\nlanguage works and the desire to subvert language an assertion of freedom or by their opacity a plea\nfor order, imposed from without, and comprehension through ideas about writing, removed from the\nobjects in the world that they scrutinize? Everything is already destroyed around us. Yet what can we\ndo to rebuild when the old forms are radioactive with the half-lives that constructed them?\n\n         'Codified repressions' are ipso facto ways of restraining and accumulating thought with\nwriting. But the problem is not how to create an undifferentiated 'libidinal' mass, but how to avoid it\nas an alternative to the oppressiveness of normative grammar. Thought in language, language itself, is\nrepressed in the area of the signifier and the signified by limitations of assumption, place and time as\na narrative continually cuts off the access routes to other narratives and non-narrative possibilities in\norder to 'get on with the story', as if we are impatient. The danger is not the 'dehumanization' of the\nsignifier by quantum mechanics and probability. It is entropy and a narrow view of our priorities.\n\n\n"},{"uid":"JamesSherry_Postscript_1978","author":"James Sherry","shortTitle":"Postscript","title":"James Sherry | Postscript | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn3\/pictures\/024.html","text":"\n\n\n        POSTSCRIPT\n\n\n  The Politics of the Referent, edited by Steve McCaffery: McCaffery, \"The\n  Death of the Subject: The Implications of Counter-Communication\"; Bruce\n  Andrews, \"Text and Context\"; Ray DiPalma, \"Crystals\"; Ron Silliman, from\n  \"aRb\"; Charles Bernstein, \"Stray Straws and Straw Men\"; Ellsworth Snyder,\n  \"Gertrude Stein and John Cage\".

What happens to the aesthetic impulse when\n  language is displaced toward the relations implicit between us and it,\n  that is, away from relations between it and the phenomenal world.\n\n\n     A Short Interview with Steve McCaffery \u2014\n\n     Q: What happens to the aesthetic impulse if language is politicized?\n     A: It does not seem essential to me.\n\n     I would agree with Snyder that words regarded as facts, as opposed\nto words as symbols, are more useful today, but useful in the way any\n\u2019\u2019new\u201d art tends to satirize contemporary society: If we think capitalism\ncommoditizes our works beyond their ability to overcome that tendency\nwith their \"awful beauty\", then we can imagine advanced art or theorizing\nmakes fun of this tendency by always seeking to invent, recontextualize\n(perhaps this is more ecologically sound), conceptualize, etc., rather\nthan.... I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to know what, too.\n\n     The impulse behind this move away from reference, image and meaning\nin the conventional way is the same impulse that directed the painting\nof \"Desmoiselles D\u2019Avignon,\" or enabled Schoenberg, led by his musical\npredecessors, to deviate so far from the key note that he simply never\ncame back. We can say the same thing about representation in literature.\n\n     Certainly Stein et al. began these events, so we cannot claim that\nthese authors are creating something entirely new. Rather they are\nannouncing that something has already taken place and the disparate\nelements of these modes of writing are ready to be collated into culture\nproper, not isolated or kept tangential to the \"real\" world of the\nConsumer Price Index and SALT. These essays announce that the works of\nearlier writers are not to be regarded as another step toward randomness,\nrather they are to be developed. Yet in what way does this kind of\nwriting try to transcend the nature of advances and put an end to period\nmannerism?\n\n     Can we get to the point where we do not need to be reassured by\nmeaning which accompanies language? Can we use language not as a lens\nthrough which the world is pleasantly or wrathfully distorted for the\npurposes of lulling the reader into another world of lies and symbols?\nCan we come to the realization that language is one of the languages?\nThat the question as to whether society or consciousness informs first is\nsomething for Marx and Freud to battle over in heaven? That we can view\nall the languages as mutually reflexive where the light bouncing back and\nforth between these planes is the mode of expression, in this case\nEnglish? That spoken or written language is not a box for meaning\u2014it\nis the content(s)?\n\n     Freeing words from hidden meanings is just the first step. To\ndecommoditize language in writing, one may need to call into question\neven the morphemic quality of language. This raises questions of compre-\nhensibility. Can the relationship between reader and writer really be so\nchanged? Silliman makes the incredible claim that alphabet takes language\nout of person and that a book makes poetry into a commodity. Well....\nMore importantly, are the claims implicit in these assertions justified?\n\n\nIs the kind of writing at the root of these essays, call it what you will,\npossessed of as many possibilities and permutations as centuries of\nreferential writing. Silliman claims non-referential writing, like that\nof Grenier, reveal referential works to be of a specific type\u2014their\nlocality was engrossing\u2014a special case like Newton in relation to\nrelativistic mechanics.\n\n     These essays do not propose writing which creates a hypnotic simul-\nacrum\u2014an illusion that seems like realism\u2014but rather they perform a\nrealization showing that language as a system parallel to experience\nreally exists, influences and works in itself and by its relations\nelucidates experience. The program suggested in these essays appears to\ncover reality with language, hence the need to stretch the page.\n\nJAMES SHERRY\n\n"},{"uid":"JamesSherry_ReviewsandNotesTinaDarragh_1980","author":"James Sherry","shortTitle":"Reviews and Notes: Tina Darragh","title":"James Sherry | Reviews and Notes: Tina Darragh | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn11\/pictures\/016.html","text":"\nTINA DARRAGH (side two), and DOUG LANG (side one), Xa (1979; Widemouth\nAudiotapes, c\/o Mason, 715 East 33rd Street, Baltimore, MD 21218; $3.50)\n\n\nA poetry reading chapbook series, without audience only the sound of the\npages turning voicei What is there about only sound?

Working with different\ncolQred strokes about an inch and a half long I could create order\nautomatically by application, sinking the strokes into a wet white\nground. They slanted to the upper right hand corner and appeared to be\nmoving up like suspended rain. I was fascinated with the material it-\nself; each brushstroke was a real entity; the relationship of one to the\nother was an event. The first painting was called \"Defying Gravity\".\nThe painting was its own composition; working on it involved adjusting\nindividual strokes after getting the whole painting down at once. In\nthis way composition was also content. And I found I didn\u2019t have to di-\nvide my attention. Except for the adjusting, I learned to minimize in-\ntellectual or critical decisions while painting.\n\n      Playing out the permutations of the idea, widening and narrowing\nthe distance between the strokes, making white patches with the ground,\ngrouping strokes in various ways until the paintings became fields of\nvery light pastel impasto strokes with only an edge between them, the\nground more or less became the surface. I cut into this surface with a\nsingle color, painting between the strokes to find their edges, invert-\ning the process which I had begun by painting the strokes. I tried\nacross several panels to make a narrative and became fascinated with the\nline between the panels in the same way I grew fond of the edges the\nstrokes created.\n\n      I made a line through a painting that looked like a panel line.\nI thought of each section as a different painting in that the strokes\nstopped at the line the way they would at the edge of a painting, but\nI still adjusted the painting as a whole. Eventually I crossed the line\nwith a stroke. The bottom 2\/3 of the painting became solid strokes,\nthe top another color with strokes of the bottom color sailing through\nit. I called these paintings \"Crossovers\". At the point where the\nstroke crossed the line there was a three dimensional possibility. To\navoid maximizing this possibility I closed the top third of the cross-\nover so I had a solid red painting composed of strokes with a line\nthrough it.\n\n      When I first began to use the line, it was an assertion into the\npainting, an interruption of a continuous field and also an assertion\nin the sense that it was usually not well integrated with the impasto\nbrushstrokes I was using, the line being an illusion of an entirely\ndifferent nature. For a while I focused so closely on the line that I\nsplit the canvas and made it an actual space between surfaces which\nevolved into constructions of several panels separated by an inch.\n\n\n      I returned to a single surface and after some time, found a way\nof melding the strokes and using the paint in a way that made sense in\nconjunction with the use of line or lines. At this point painting\nopened up for me again. I was less interested in the painting as an\nobject and more interested in painting the painting. Previously I had\nused the paint in a sculptural way and was interested in the shadows\ncast by texture in different lights and the possibility of the painting\nbeing a light receptor. I wanted to paint in a lot of information that\nthe impasto had supplied. I no longer wanted the painting to account\nfor the possible light changes outside of itself in the way it was made.\nI preferred to paint it one way and hoped it would be seen that way in\nspite of variations in the light.\n\n      The new paintings are still about their own composition like the\nfirst brushstroke paintings. The lines are vertical, because they are\nabout perception and horizontal lines always seem to imply a landscape.\nIn these paintings the lines are integrated, because they come from the\nlower layer of paint and become the edges of panels they divide. They\nare first painted terra rosa and then thalo green into the red while it\nis wet, so the ground shows through as lines and the masses and lines\ncreate each other. If there is something wrong with the surface, I\npaint the entire thing again. Sometimes there is more tension, some-\ntimes less, which determines the character of the painting. Sometimes\nthere is a sense of pressure as if the red were light that is contained\nwithin the painting, but not released. The shape of the canvas, square\nor rectangle, affects the tension between the parts of the work....\n\nLEE SHERRY\n"},{"uid":"RonSilliman_BenjaminObscura_1978","author":"Ron Silliman","shortTitle":"Benjamin Obscura","title":"Ron Silliman | Benjamin Obscura | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn6\/pictures\/014.html","text":"\nBENJAMIN OBSCURA\n\n\n\n(What follows is an excerpt from a much longer text on Walter Benjamin\nby Ron Silliman.

Fraccaro, Box 578, Canal St. Sta.,\nNew York, NY 10013, $2.95, and Problematic Photography, edited by C.\nLoeffler, , La Martelle Press, Box 3123, San Francisco, CA 94119).\n\n\n\nBenjamin\u2019s characterization of the photograph ... functions also to\nnote the role of the camera in a crucial step toward the fetishized\nrealism which embodies the capitalist mode of thought ... the hand in\nthe process of pictorial reproduction is stripped of its gestural\ncontent. The loss of the gestural is a topic I have gone into in some\ndepth elsewhere as it pertains to the history of poetry, a portion of\nwhich is worth repeating here:\n\n   \u2019\u2019What happens when a language moves toward and passes into a\n    capitalist stage of development is an anaesthetic transformation\n    of the perceived tangibility of the word, with corresponding\n    increases in its descriptive and narrative capacities, precondi-\n    tions for the invention of \u2019realism,\u2019 the optical illusion of\n    reality in capitalist thought. These developments are tied\n    directly to the nature of reference in language, which under\n    capitalism is transformed (deformed) into referentiality.\n\n       In its primary form, reference takes the character of a\n    gesture and an object, such as the picking up of a stone to be\n    used as a tool. Both gesture and object carry their own integri-\n    ties and are not confused: a sequence of gestures is distinct\n    from the objects which may be involved, as distinct as the labor\n    process is from its resultant commodities, A sequence of gestures\n    forms a discourse, not a description.\u201d\n\nThe obliteration of the gestural through the elaboration of technology\noccurs across the entire range of cultural phenomena in the capitalist\nperiod. It is the principle affective transformation of the new\nmaterial basis of production. Guttenberg\u2019s moveable type erased ges-\nturality from the graphemic dimension of books. That this in turn\nfunctions to alienate the producer from his or her product is tangible\neven to authors who compose on the typewriter: to see one\u2019s text in a\nnew typeface (inevitably asserting different spatio-visual values) is\nalmost as radical a shock as first seeing oneself on film or videotape,\nor initially hearing one\u2019s voice remarkably other on a tape recorder.\nIn a parallel manner, the constantly evolving and always unique objects\nof master craftsmen were replaced by the uniform (hence infinitely\nreproducible) objects of mass production (where, as Benjamin was to\n\n\ndiscover, the gestural is replaced by its antithesis: style),\n\n     (Benjamin:) \"Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is\nlacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique\nexistence at the place where it happens to be ,,. the quality of its\npresence is always depreciated ,.. One might subsume the eliminated\nelement in the term \u2019aura\u2019 and go on to say: that which withers in the\nage of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art ,,,\nExperience of the aura ... rests on the transposition of a response\ncommon in human relationships to the relationship between the inanimate\nor natural object and man ... To perceive the aura of an object we look\nat means to invest it with the ability to look at us in return.\"\nAppearance, which is specifically an object in relation to an observer,\nis in each instance the privileged notion. Under the name of aura what\nappears is the Other, a shock, the recognition and acknowledgement of\nits absolute integrity freed from any dependency on the presence of\nSelf. This liberty presents itself as \u2019distance' and \u2019the experience\nwhich has left traces of the practiced hand.' It does not (cannot)\noccur abstractly, that is: in the absence of the concrete object itself\nas presence. This is how it escapes both memory and reproduction. The\naffective presence of a photograph of a massacre, a Rembrandt or an\norchid is first of all that of a (gray) rectangle of a certain size,\nwhich is almost never that of the event or object portrayed.\n\nWhat is radically new in the age of technical reproduction is just this\nvalue placed on the possession of entities deprived of their integrity\nand otherness, personal experience reduced to vicarious consumption\n(which of course follows and parallels exactly that which befell lite-\nrature during the rise and brief reign of the novel), But to lose the\nOther is, in the same instant, to abandon one\u2019s sense of Self, to be\nrendered numb and passive on a level not previously possible in history.\nIn \"The Work of Art,\" Benjamin necessarily defines aura by exposing\nits \u2019decay,\u2019 its very existence revealed in this place of a lack, and\ngoes further to implicate as the origin of this erosion not merely\nindustrial imperialism, but that which made capitalism itself (and\neven capital) possible, the constituting myth of western civilization,\nIdentity......\n\n     (Benjamin:) \"To pry an object from its shell, to destroy its aura,\nis the mark of a perception whose 'sense of the universal equality of\nthings' has increased to such a degree that it extracts it even from a\nunique object by means of reproduction.\"\n\nA 'sense of the universal equality of things,' identity, destroys aura,\naccomplishing this by the removal of the object from its constituting\ncontext. This is also its advantage, since concealed within it is the\n\n\nwhole of the scientific method and project... Each of the five funda-\nmental axioms of Euclidean geometry, which served for centuries as the\nmodel for science itself, is in some sense a statement of identity, of\nwhich the first is \"Things equal to the same thing are equal to each\nother\" (if A = B and B = C, the A = C, etc,).

A typical example would be the\nomission of an r in the word \"your\" in Tanner's recent Jonah who will\nbe 25 in the year 2000. Since a film such as Jonah (or those directed\nby Truffaut, Bergman or Wertmuller) is made with at least one eye on\ndistribution to the Anglo-American market, such errata cannot be suf-\nficiently explained away as a consequence of the precarious and some-\nwhat secondary existence of an export print (which, on occasion, is\neven re-edited for the new market, as was Roeg's The Man Who Feit to\nEarth). The fact remains that in current bourgeois cinema, attention\nto the development of all visio-spatial information is total. That the\ndisruptive nature of typographical errors in sub-titles is not noticed\nand corrected is a sign that it is not felt.\n\n     This links it to a broad variety of other social phenomena, such\nas the method of speed-reading in which individual words recede and are\nreplaced by a Gestalt comprehension of content, or the techniques de-\nveloped for display advertising and product packaging (including mass\nmarket publishing) for the printing of information which, for any number\nof reasons (e.g., it is considered \"inessential\" such as the identifi-\ncation of the jacket designer, or possibly counterproductive to sales,\nsuch as a listing of chemical additives in canned foods), the producer\ndoes not wish the potential customer to read. Linguistically, the most\nrevealing detail of Noam Chomsky's Reflections on Language may well be\nthe ISBN number on its rear cover, printed in a different direction and\n\n\nin a lighter color than the rest of that page's text.\n\n     A McLuhanist interpretation, further linking these to even broader\nsocial facts such as the rise, and subsequent crisis, of the novel or\nmodernist tendencies in art in general, would not be incorrect as such,\nbut would fail to sufficiently explain the underlying social reasons\nfor the phenomena and thereby fail to suggest an appropriate course for\naction by art workers generally and specifically by writers.\n\n     For several years I have been involved in a series of investigations\n{Language Games, 'Lhe Chinese Notebook and aRb) predicated upon Louis\nZukofsky's projection of a possible \"scientific\" definition of poetry\n(first outlined by him in the preface to the 1948 Origin edition of\nA 7-72). While the third investigation is still in progress, some\nfairly specific statements concerning the object of inquiry can be made:\n(1) the stage of historical development determines the natural laws (or,\nif you prefer the terminology, the underlying structures) of poetry;\n(2) the stage of historical development determines the natural laws of\nlanguage; (3) the primary impact on language, and language arts, of the\nrise of capitalism has been in the area of reference and is directly\nrelated to the phenomena known as the commodity fetish. It is this\neffect of the rise of capitalism, particularly in its later state and\nmonopoly forms, which underlies the effaced r in Jonah.\n\n     The essential nature of the social determination of consciousness\nhas largely been misinterpreted by Marxists and non-Marxists alike.\nThus Chomsky, feeling social determinism to be in contradiction to his\ninnateness thesis, writes:\n\n           Gramsci went so far as to argue that \"the fundamental inno-\n           vation introduced by Marxism into the science of politics and\n           history is the proof that there does not exist an abstract,\n           fixed and immutable 'human nature'...but that human nature is\n           the totality of historically determined social relations\"...\n           \u2014a statement that is surely false, in that there is no such\n           proof, and a questionable reading of Marx.\n\n                                           (Chomsky, 1975, p. 128)\n\nWhile Gramsci's formulation constitutes an implicit oversimplification\n(leading, for example, to behaviorist errors and the idea that human\nnature can be altered in short periods of time), proofs of the social\ndetermination of consciousness do exist. The elaboration of the tool-\nmaking capacity of the australopithicene required an expansion of the\nfrontal area of the cerebral cortex and hominid brain consequently grew\nfrom 500 cc. 1,500,000 years ago to 1100 cc. 350,000 years ago and\neventually to the modern 1400 cc. (Robert J. Maxwell in Yaker et al,\n1971, p. 39\u00ab) Most of the \"innate cognitive capacity\" of Chomsky's\nthesis is indeed the result of a \"mode of production of material life.\"\nHe and Gramsci are equally guilty of the gross application of a complex\nreality.\n\n\n     The question before us is, however, of a much more specific nature\nthan the social determination of all inate cognitive capacity: the im-\npact of emergence of capitalism on language and the language arts.\nThis question can be restated as Does capitalism have a specific\n\"reality\" which is passed through the language and thereby imposed on\nits speakers? Thus framed, the question can be answered affirmatively.\n\n     First we need to note some key differences in the language use of\ngroups which have not as yet been thoroughly totalized into the global\nclass structure of monopoly and state capitalism. Because writing\ntypically occurs in a society which has already undergone significant\ndivisions of labor (i.e., historical development), the best sources of\nany relatively tribal literature exist in modern ethnological tran-\nscriptions, rather than in the early written records of the Judeo-\nChristian civilization. The following is an English language transla-\ntion of a Fox tribe sweatbath poem:\n\nA gi ya ni a gi yan ni i\nA gi ya ni a gi yan ni i\nA gi ya ni a gi yan ni i\nA gi ya ni agi ya ni    \nSky                      \nA gi ya ni i a gi ya ni \nA gi ya ni i a gi ya ni \nA gi ya ni              \n\n(Rothenberg, 1972, p. 341)\n\n\nThe presence of \"nonsense\" syllables in tribal literature is unmistake-\nable. Save for attempts at specifically anthropological explanations,\nthere is no room in contemporary literary theory for a poetry of this\nkind, no existing mechanism for positing it coherently alongside the\nwork of Dante, Li Po or Tzara. The fact that there have been as yet\nfew attempts to incorporate such materials into \"comparative literature\"\ncurricula by the educational system of the industrial nations is not\nsimply attributable to racism, though racism inevitably plays a role.\nRather, it is that in the reality of capitalism (or of any society well\ndown the road toward capitalist modes of production) there is no meaning\nhere.\n\n     But capitalism did not spring up overnight amid loose associations\nof groups at a tribal stage of development. It came into existence\nthrough a long succession of stages, each with its own characteristic\nmodes of production and social relations. While the literature of a\npeople about to enter into the stage of capitalism through bourgeois\nrevolution will necessarily be much closer to our own experience, dif-\nferences can still be observed. The following are the first eleven\nlines of \"The Tunnying of Elynour Rummying\" by John Skelton, written in\nabout 1517:\n\n\n           Tell you I chyll,\n           If that ye wyll\n           A whyle be styll,\n           Of a comely gyll\n           That dwelt on a hyll;\n           But she is not gryll,\n           For she is somewhat sage\n           And well worne in age,\n           For her vysage\n           It woldt aswage\n           A mannes courage.\n\n\n(Sylvester, 1974, p. 69)\n\n\nOnly one word {gvyll * meaning \"fierce\") has dropped from the vocabulary.\nShifts of spelling, pronunciation and syntactic structure are more vis-\nible (largely explicable by the standardizing effect of printing \u2014\nCaxton's press was only forty years old when these lines were written),\nbut the most obvious difference between Skelton's poetry and the modern\nis its use of rhyme: eleven consecutive end-rhymes using only two\nendings, -yll and -age, plus five other instances of internal rhyme and\noff-rhyme (ZeZZ, whyley dwelt, well, woldt}. This is the inverse of\nthe effaced r of Jonah: it is an ordering of the language by its physi-\ncal characteristics, its \"nonlinguistic\" ones, a sign that this dimension\nis felt.\n\n     Another characteristic trait of the English poetry of 400 years\nago is its almost exclusive focus upon either love, the ontological\nproject of the period, or religious and heroic themes passed down from\nthe traditions of colonial invaders, works to be valued as rearticula-\ntions rather than as sensuous apprehensions of the experiential. It\nwas not the purpose of the language in the 16th century poem to describe\nthe daily life of even the bourgeois, let alone the common man.\n\n     What happens when a language moves toward and passes into a capital-\nist stage of development is an anaesthetic transformation of the per-\nceived tangibility of the word, with corresponding increases in its\ndescriptive and narrative capacities, preconditions for the invention\nof \"realism,\" the optical illusion of reality in capitalist thought.\nThese developments are tied directly to the nature of reference in\nlanguage, which under capitalism is transformed (deformed) into referen-\ntiality.\n\n     In its primary form, reference takes the character of a gesture\nand an object, such as the picking up of a stone to be used as a tool.\nBoth gesture and object carry their own integrities and are not con-\nfused: a sequence of gestures is distinct from the objects which may\nbe involved, as distinct as the labor process is from its resultant\ncommodities. A sequence of gestures forms a discourse, not a descrip-\ntion. It is precisely the expressive integrity of the gestural nature\n\n\nof language which constitutes the meaning of the \"nonsense\" syllables\nin tribal poetries; its persistence in such characteristics of Skelton's\npoetry as his rhyme is that of a trace.\n\n     The individual within the tribal society had not been reduced to\nwage labor, nor did the reproduction of his or her material life require\nthe consumption of a significant number of commodities created through\nthe labor of others. The world of natural and self-created objects is\ndecidedly different from the world of things.\n\n           As men changed the world they expanded and refined their\n          ability to know it, and the growing capacity for cognition\n          again enhanced their ability to change it. Man creates him-\n          self by his works; by his estrangement from himself he becomes\n          his own creation.\n\n(Fischer, 1970, pp. 152-3)\n\nA thing is at once both the end product of a labor process and a com-\nmodity of general social consumption. A thing is a schizoid object.\nOr, to use Lacanian terminology, a thing is an overdetermined object.\nA world which is made up of such dual projections can only be resolved\nwhen the forces of production control both the means of production and\nconsumption.\n\n     Wherever such a resolution is not the case, then a struggle arises\nbetween the opposing projections: class struggle over consciousness.\nWhere the bourgeois is the rising class, the expressive, gestural,\nlabor-product nature of consciousness tends to be repressed. The objects\nof consciousness are reduced to commodities and take on the character of\na fetish. Things which appear to move \"freely,\" absent all gesture,\nare the elements of a world of description. The commodity fetish in\nlanguage becomes one of description, of the referential, and has a\nsecond higher-order fetish of narration.\n\n           115. A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside\n          it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat\n          it to us inexorably.\n\n(Wittgenstein, 1953, p 48e)\n\n     This mass aphasia within the English language occurs gradually over\na period of 400 years. The rise of capitalism sets the preconditions\nfor the rise of the novel, the invention of the optical illusion of\nrealism, the final breakdown of gestural poetic forms, and the separa-\ntion of self-consciousness of the art-object from the consciousness of\nthe object itself in the rise of literary criticism.\n\n     Repression does not, fortunately, abolish the existence of the re-\npressed element which continues as a contradiction, often invisible, in\nthe social fact. As such, it continues to wage the class struggle of\nconsciousness. The history of Anglo-American literature under capital-\nism is the history of this struggle. It can be discussed at many levels;\n\n\nthe remainder of this paper will touch on a few.\n\n     An event of significance is the development of books of poetry,\nusually dated in English by the publication of TotteUs Miscellany in\n1557. If the very invention of the alphabet represents the initial,\npre-capitalist, division of labor in language, the first movement of\nthe language beyond the physical borders of the individual, and if the\ndevelopment of bards leads to a further class division into a class of\nauthors and a class of consumers (in a purely tribal society, the poem\nis the shared language event of the group, the tribe is both author and\nconsumer (Cf. chain-gang and jump-rope songs, two forms reminiscent of\ntribal authorship)), the arrival of the book greatly accelerates the\nprocess. From this moment forward, authors will see increasingly less\nof their audiences.\n\n     Another symptom of this gradual repression is the replacement, by\n1750, of subjective styles of italicization and capitalization by\n\"modern conventional\" usage.\n\n              The rather surprising thing is that so conspicuous and\n          far-reaching a change should have evoked so little contem-\n          porary comment. The whole visual effect of a page of type\n          is transformed by it. For us, this entails also a change in\n          psychological response. Men do not ordinarily leave unre-\n          marked the swift departure of time-honored custom.\n\n(Bronson, 1958, p. 17)\n\nBut if the nature of this change is recognized as repression, then such\na conspiracy of silence is not surprising at all. By 1760 one writer,\nEdward Capell, had gone so far as to discontinue the capitalization of\nthe initial letter of each line of the poem.\n\n     Even in the 18th century the contradictions of the commoditization\nof language result in counter-tendencies. The bourgeois English reader\nhad to participate in the production of the book-as-object, for it was\nhe or she who had to have it bound. Thus individual libraries were\nbound according to internal aesthetic values, looking quite unlike the\nhodge-podge of colors and book sizes which typify the modern paperback\nhome library. The sole trace of this counter-tendency in the modern\nera is the binding style used by encyclopedias and law books, intended\nto recall the style of that period.\n\n     Because of its singular adaptation to capitalist culture, the\nnovel, a distinct subdivision of the poem, is a primary source for any\netiology of capitalist reality. Of particular interest are the major\nforms of response to the modern \"crisis\" of the novel: the art novel,\nthe mass market novel and the movies. Before turning to these forms,\nsome preliminary comments should be made concerning the nature of the\nserialized language consumer and the inherently deformed relationship\nof the novel to its matrix of origin: the poem.\n\n\n     The two primary types of human relationships are the group and the\nseries. The former is characteristic of tribal societies. Seriali-\nzation (often termed alienation or atomization) places the individual\nas a passive cipher into a series of more or less identical units.\nWhitman's \"simple separate person.\" Its apotheosis is to be found in\nthe modern unemployment line. The function of the commoditized tongue\nof capitalism is the serialization of the language-user, especially the\nreader. In its ultimate form, the consumer of a mass market novel such\nas Jab)s stares numbly at a \"blank\" page (the page also of the speed-\nreader) while a story appears to unfold miraculously of its own free\nwill before his or her eyes. The presence of language appears as re-\ncessive as the sub-title of a foreign language film.\n\n     The work of each poet, each poem, is a response to a determinate\ncoordinate of language and history. Each writer possesses in his or her\nimagination a subjective conceptualization of this matrix (inevitably\npartial, inevitably a distortion of the objective matrix which, by\ndefinition, is the sum of all poems), which is usually termed the tra-\ndition. If the functional structure of the objective matrix is that of\na grid of coordinates (in which history plays an increasingly dominant\nrole: see the chart of the \"Rise of Historical Consciousness in the\nMaking of Art,\" Burnham, 1973, p. 47), the subjective perception is that\nof a galaxy, or of a gas in a vacuum in which the work of major writers,\nimportant schools and close friends appear as large molecules and denser\nregions. The locus of the work to be written is felt as a blind spot\nin the subjective matrix, a primal lack toward which the writer is\ndriven. This is the essential truth of the cliche that poets write only\nthose poems which they need. Each successful poem abolishes (but only\nfor a time) the primal lack and subtly reorganizes the structure of the\nmatrix. \u00bfFor a fuller discussion of the role of the matrix in the\nstructure of individual poems, see the article \"Performance\" in Shocks\nmagazine and \"A note concerning the current status of aRb\" in Oculist\nWitnesses?]\n\n     When language is serialized, commoditized, the repressive element\ndeforms the subjective perception of the matrix. The multitudinous\nqualms, hesitations and self-doubts about this repressive deformation\nwhich fill Sterne's Tristam Shandy are increasingly anaesthetized by\nthe rise of capitalism and appear not even to be felt by the modern\npulp novelist who can just sit down and hack it out. (When it is felt,\nthe consequence is often a phenomenon known as a \"writer's block\".)\nFor any Rex Stout, the movement of objects, absent the presence of any\ngestural element, presents no problem. The cumulative and\/or continuous\npresent so typical of the temporal environments of the tribal has re-\nceded before the possibility of movement-in-time, the capacity for\nnarrative has been greatly enhanced. The underlying precondition of\nthe rise of the novel is precisely this divorce, by repression, from\nthe gravitational force of language in the matrix, an assumption that\n\n\nthe free evolution of a narrative art, as such, is possible, but this\nis an assumption feasible only well within the confines of the commodity\nfetish of language. Thus the seed of the modern \"crisis of the novel\"\nwas implanted at the very beginning, its inevitability inherent in the\nform itself. Instead of \"freely\" leaving the gravitational pull of\nlanguage, the novel, like a rocket with insufficient thrust, is doomed\nto fall back into the atmosphere of its matrix: the peculiar affliction\nof Tyrone Slothrop is that of the novel itself.\n\n     Beginning with the early modernists, many novelists of serious\nintent at least sense the nature of the contradiction and attempt to\nconfront it directly. Gertrude Stein attempts to reintroduce the con-\ntinuous present. Hemingway strives for an art of the sentence as the\nnovel's determining language-unit (Cf. the illuminating discussion of\nHemingway, itself conducted well within the commodity fetish of language,\nin Jameson, 1971, pp. 409-13). Joyce attempts a frontal assault, the\nreintegration of the novel into language, but his is a pre-Saussurian\nlinguistics, that of etymologies. Such approaches lead eventually to\nall manifestations of the contemporary art-novel. Of particular note\nwithin this vein is the appearance of a subdivision of novelists who\nwrite for, and are principally read by, poets, such as Jack Kerouac,\nDouglas Woolf, Paul Metcalf, Harry Matthews, Kathy Acker and Fielding\nDawson.\n\n     Another tendency of response to the crisis of the novel is to\naccept commoditization and to go on to write novels in which the language\nis all but invisible. While Saul Bellow (or Pearl Buck or John\nSteinbeck) represents an attempt to achieve this within a serious mode\n(the novel as a language art continuing to recall its prehistory in the\npoem, as art), and while a number of other novelists merely stylize\ntheir acquiescence (Mailer, Vonnegut, Roth, et al), more typical \u2014 and\nmore revealing \u2014 are those who carry commoditization toward its logical\nconclusions in the mass market best-seller, such as Leon Uris, Peter\nBenchley or Mario Puzo. Mickey Spillane, who simply dictates his\nnovels, carries the disappearance-of-the-word\/appearance-of-the-world\nsyndrome to its limit in writing.\n\n     But writing need not be the limit. Jettisoning the matrix-factor\nof language altogether, one tendency of narrative art takes advantage\nof a new technological development (capitalism's classic defence mechan-\nism) and imposes itself on a new and still unformed matrix. This is\nthe invention of modern cinema, the movies. The transition from novel\nto film further enables this tendency to modernize its mode of pro-\nduction into a more truly capitalist structure. The lone novelist of\n1850, whose product is that of a manufacture-era cottage industry,\nbecomes a century later the modern film company , with a small group of\nproducers who own and control the means of production and a much larger,\nthoroughly stratified, labor force, from director to \"best boy.\" That\nthe imposition of narrative onto the matrix of film was not necessarily\n\n\ninherent in the formal elements of cinema per se is a consistent theme\nin the avante-garde or personal film of the past several decades. The\nvery existence of a film such as Vertov's 1928 Man With a Movie Camera,\nmade in the Soviet Union, indicates that it need not have been the case.\nBut such is the nature of capitalist reality \u2014 it is imperialistic.\n\n     This listing of tendencies of response within the novel is neces-\nsarily brief. Similarly, a history of literary criticism could be writ-\nten, identifying its origins within the matrix of the poem, its exteri-\norizing serialization and the resolution of its subsequent crisis\nthrough state subsidy by its implantation into the university structure,\nmaking it an adjunct of tenure. Such a history would begin with a defi-\nnition of the function of literary criticism as the separation of the\nself-consciousness of the activity of the poem from the poem itself.\nIt would locate the necessity for this separation in the repressive\nelement of the serialization of language as it moves into a capitalist\nperiod. It would explore in depth the role of literary criticism in a\ncapitalist society as the creation of a \"safe\" and \"official\" matrix\nthrough its self-restriction of the object of inquiry to a small number\nof works identified as the national literature. It would study the\noptical illusion of literary criticism in the clarity of the essay form,\nin which the contradictions of its existence such as would be revealed\nthrough inarticulations, redundancies and non-sequiturs are subsumed by\nthe tautological form, rendered invisible rather than resolved. Finally\nit would study the existence of counter-tendencies within literary criti-\ncism as well, specifically the anarchic works of literary theory created\nby poets (e.g., the body of prose left by Charles Olson) and the recent\ntrend in France toward literary criticism as an admitted art form (e.g.,\nRoland Barthes).\n\n     Recognition of a capitalist mode of reality passed through the\nlanguage and imposed on its speakers finally will require a thorough\nre-evaluation of the history, form and function of the poem. This is a\ntask of almost limitless dimension, for the matrix of the poem is not\nonly the point of origin for the historical phenomena of the novel and\nliterary criticism, it returns to the very social function of the arts,\na dual function: for the group, art interiorizas its consciousness by\nthe ordering (one could call it \"tuning\") of individual sense percep-\ntions; for the individual, be it artist or consumer, art provides him or\nher with experiences of that dialectical consciousness in which subject\nand object, self and other, individual and group, unite. Since it is\nprecisely this dialectic consciousness which capitalism seeks to repress\nthrough the serialization of the individual (for it is by such\nconsciousness that we know the overdetermination of the objects of our\nworld by the capitalist mode of production), the fine arts in general\nfunction as deformed counter-tendencies within the dominant capitalist\nreality. Such is the history of the poem.\n\n\n     Every major western poetic movement has been an attempt to get\nbeyond the repressing elements of capitalist reality, toward a whole\nlanguage art, much in the same manner as Stein, Joyce or Hemingway, dis-\ncussed above. Typically, they have been deformed at the outset by the\nvery condition of existing within the confines of the dominant reality.\nThe dream narratives of surrealism could never hope to go beyond the\nnarrative fetish, as hopelessly trapped within the fetish as \"socialist\nrealism.\" The entire projective tendency, from Pound to Robert Kelly,\nattempts to rediscover a physical ordering of the language, but posits\nthat order not within the language but within individuals (individualism\nis the codification of serialized man), operating on the metaphoric\nequation of a page as scored text. The recent non-referential formal-\nists, such as Clark Coolidge and Robert Grenier, frontally attack refer-\nentiality, but only through negation by specific context. To the extent\nthat negation is determined by the thing negated, they too operate\nwithin the referential fetish.\n\n     It is the function of dialectical process to not merely explain\nthe social origin and underlying structure of phenomena, but to ground\nit in the present social fact of class struggle so as to indicate ap-\npropriate courses of action. Quite clearly capitalism has its own mode\nof reality which is passed through the language and imposed on its\nspeakers. The social function of the language arts, especially the\npoem, place them in an important position to carry the class struggle\nfor consciousness to the level of consciousness. It is clear that one\ncannot change language (or consciousness) by fist: the French have only\nsucceeded in limiting their vocabulary. First there must be a change\nin the mode and control of production of material life.\n\n     By recognizing itself as the philosophy of practice in language,\npoetry can work to search out the preconditions of post-referential\nlanguage within the existing social fact. This requires (1) recognition\nof the historic nature and structure of referentiality, (2) placing the\nissue of language, the repressed element, at the center of the program,\nand (3) placing the program into the context of conscious class struggle.\nSuch poetry will take as its motto the words of Marx's The Eighteenth\nBrunaire of Louis Bonaparte:\n\n          The social revolution...cannot draw its poetry from\n          the past, but only from the future.\n\n\nBib Jiography\n\n\nBRONSON, BERTRAND H., Printing as an Index of Taste in Eighteenth Century\n     England, New York Public Library, 1958.\n\nBURNHAM, JACK, The Structure of Art (revised edition), Braziller, 1973.\n\nCHOMSKY, NOAM, Reflections on Language, Pantheon, 1975.\n\nFISCHER, ERNST, in collaboration with Franz Merek, The Essential Marx,\n     translated by Anne Bostok, The Seabury Press, 1970.\n\nJAMESON, FREDRIC, Marxism and Form: Twentieth Century Dialectical\n     Theories of Literature, Princeton University Press, 1971.\n\nROTHENBERG, JEROME (editor), Shaking the Pumpkin: Traditional Poetry of\n     the Indian Forth Americas, Doubleday Anchor Books, 1971.\n\nSYLVESTER, RICHARD S, (editor), The Anchor Anthology of Sixteenth Century\n     Verse, Doubleday Anchor Books, 1974.\n\nWITTGENSTEIN, LUDWJG, Philosophical Investigations, translated by G.E.M.\n     Anscombe, MacMillan Publishers, 1953.\n\nYAKER, HENRI, Humphrey Osmond and Frances Cheek (editors), The Future of\nTime: Manfs Temporal Environment, Doubleday Anchor Books, 1971.\n\n[note: this essay is dedicated to the English Department of the Uni-\nversity of California, Berkeley, whose professors were never able to\nexplain the why of literature, and to the California prisoners, 1972-6,\nwhose subjective perception of time under indeterminate sentence led me\nbeyond the borders of my cultural understanding.]\n\nRON SILLIMAN\n\n\nThis essay is reprinted from A Hundred Posters (edited by Alan Davies),\nissue February 1977.\n"},{"uid":"RonSilliman_ForLANGUAGE_1978","author":"Ron Silliman","shortTitle":"For L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","title":"Ron Silliman | For L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn4\/pictures\/011.html","text":"\n\n\n            SILLIMAN\n\n\n\n            FOR L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E\n\n\nWord\u2019s a sentence before it\u2019s a word\u2014I write sentences\u2014When words are,\nmeaning soon follows\u2014Where words join, writing is\u2014One\u2019s writing is one\nwriting\u2014Not all letters are equal\u20142 phrases yield an angle\u2014Eye settles\nin the middle of word, left of center\u2014Reference is a compass\u2014Each day\u2014\nPerformance seeks vaudeville\u2014Composition as investigation\u2014Collage is a\nfalse democracy\u2014Spelling\u2019s choices\u2014Line defined by its closure: the\nfunction is nostalgic\u2014Nothing without necessity\u2014By hand\u2014Individuals do\n\n\nnot exist\u2014Keep mind from sliding\u2014Structure is metaphor, content permis-\nsion, syntax force\u2014Don\u2019t imitate yourself\u2014We learned the language\u2014\nAesthetic consistency = voice\u2014How does a work end?\n\n\nRON SILLIMAN\n\n\n"},{"uid":"RonSilliman_ForOpenLetter_1980","author":"Ron Silliman","shortTitle":"For Open Letter","title":"Ron Silliman | For Open Letter | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":null,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEsupp1\/pictures\/030.html","text":"\nRON SILLIMAN\n\nFor Open Letter\n\nSteve,\n\nThe historical function of language-centered writing is to achieve, to\nthe greatest extent possible, a post-referential writing. There is a cru-\ncial distinction between non-referential and post-referential poetries\nwhich has only recently become clear. The term \u2018non-referential\u2019 was\nfirst used by Bob Grenier six or seven years ago to describe his work.\nHis two major sequences, A Day at the Beach, and Sentences, and Clark\nCoolidge\u2019s early long poems, The Maintains and Polaroid, may be\nidentified as the major products of the non-referential tendency. The\nvery form of the term \u2018non-referential\u2019 reveals its essentially diacritical\nnature. It negates reference, typically doing so by the utilization of\nspecific contexts. Perhaps more important than the works of non-\nreferentiality was the fact that it revealed referential works as objects of\na specific type.\n\nReference has always been an element in language. Its primary form\nis the combination of a gesture and an object, such as the picking up of\na rock or one fragment (thereby creating a \u2018tool\u2019). Referentiality, in the\nnarrow sense in which I am using the term here, is a specific historical\ndeformation of reference.\n\nAt an early historical stage, poems were the shared language events\nof small tribal groups. The value of the poem was one of exchange and\nuse. It was the product and common property of the tribe and not the\nindividual. The language of the poem was physical and alive to its\nspeakers. It had its own integrity and recognized the separate integrity\nof the world. It was empowered to discuss the world but did not\npresume to describe it. It was the gesture and not the object. The joy in\nlanguage was that which any man or woman feels in any act of creative\nlabour. One sees evidences of this reality everywhere in the tribal\npoetries of the world, much of which has been made commonly\navailable by the work of Jerry Rothenberg. One even sees its traces in\nearly English literature. Rhyme is an ordering of language by its phys-\nical elements. The physicality of language as a determining element\ncommonly recognized by all speakers is a precondition of any such\nordering.\n\nOne need only point to the fact of Evelyn Wood and speed-reading\nto get a sense that there has been a drastic change. Language has\nchanged and with it there have been changes in the art of language, in\nthe poem.\n\nIn the preface to the 1948 Origin edition of A 1-12, Louis\n(pronounced \u2018Lewie\u2019) Zukofsky projected the possibility of a\n\n\u2018scientific\u2019 definition of poetry, true for all poems past and future.\nWhat Zukofsky, a Marxist, should have known (but the historical\npreconditions for such a knowledge were not yet present) was that the\nstage of historical development determines the natural laws of the\npoem. Indeed, the stage of historical development determines the\nnatural laws of language.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind the fact that in history and in society\nall \u2018laws\u2019 have the nature of a tendency.\n\nAt a certain post-tribal stage of development, the world of natural\nobjects was replaced by a world of things. The defining characteristic\nof a thing is its double-projection: it is both the end result of a labour\nprocess (a product) and an object for general social consumption (a\ncommodity). A thing is a schizoid object. A world of such things is\nmadness. The resolution of this dual projection can only occur when\nthe productive forces control the means of production and consump-\ntion: in short, communism.\n\nIf such a resolution does not (as has been the case everywhere in the\nworld) occur, then a struggle arises between the opposing projections.\nWhen one set of forces is dominant, the other is repressed. This has\ntaken place not simply in the market-place, but in every aspect of\nsociety and humanity. It has determined consciousness.\n\nThe repression of the product* (labour) nature of things is called the\ncommodity fetish. In language it is a fetish of description, of reference\nand has a second higher-order fetish of narration. It is the picture\nWittgenstein could not get outside (for it lay in his language and his\nlanguage seemed to repeat it to him inexorably). It is the object\nwithout the gesture. The object appears now to move of its own free\nwill. We are, all of us, suffering from a mass aphasia. Language-\ncentered writing is a step on the road to health.\n\nThe English language lost its product-nature gradually over a\nperiod of 400 years. The new commodity language gradually took on\nnew descriptive powers. It was now able to describe the world. This\nprocess was a complex one, which can be discussed at many levels.\nOne major event was the origin of the book of poems in 1557. If the\nvery invention of an alphabet is the first step toward the taking of the\nlanguage out of the person (so that, generations later one learns\ngrammar as an external \u2018objective\u2019 fact), the book made the com-\nmoditization of the poem much easier. It is in fact the most typical\ncommodity manifestation imaginable. The poet no longer could see\nhis audience. He was no longer a member of a small tribal group, but\nnow was an author, had himself undergone a division of labour. By\n1750, the subjective use of capital letters and italics had been replaced\nby \u2018modern conventional\u2019 usage. Variants of the poem, such as the\nnovel and literary criticism, had begun to look and act like separate\n\n\nphenomena (which they are not). Still, in the eighteenth century the\nreader in England was expected to bind his or her book to fit the style\nof his library, a curious counter-tendency (history is full of them)\nwhose only modern remnant is the binding style of encyclopedias and\nlaw books in imitation of such styles.\n\nThe ultimate act of the commoditized poem is the novel in which\nthe now passive reader (this too a division of labour) stares at a \u2018blank\u2019\npage while a story appears to unfold miraculously in front of his or\nher eyes.\n\nThe wonderful thing about repression is that, In the end, it never\nworks. The history of modern. literature is that of a continuous\nstruggle between; the forces of commodity language (the capitalists)\nand those of product language (the working class).\n\nConsider the novel. Born well within the commodity fetish, it does\nnot comprehend that it is doubly bound by the gravitational forces of\nlanguage and history. It assumes that it can evolve \u2018freely.\u2019 Like a rocket\nwith insufficient thrust, it begins (around 1900) to fall back into the\natmospherefof language. Thus the crisis the novel, which takes\nthree specific forms.\n\nThe modernists recognize the fact of language and thereby attempt\nto re-enter the atmosphere, leadings to all manifestations of the art-\nnovel. In fact some of these works, such as Visions of Cody and\nGravity's Rainbow are the great poems of our time. Another\nmanifestation of this form is the novelist who writes for, and is read by,\npoets: Douglas Woolf, Paul Metcalf, Harry Matthews, Kathy Acker,\nFielding Dawson, etc.\n\nThe fully commoditized novelists turn to the production of just\nsuch type of literature: Mario Puzo, Peter Benchley, Leon Uris.\n\nA third form jettisons language and takes over a new art form madee\npossible by capitalist technology: film. The lone author of 1850 is, by\n1950, now a film company with a completely stratified labour force:\ngrips, best boys, rewrite specialistis. And, of course, a group of\nproducers who now own the means of production.\n\nEvery major type of modernism can been seen as attempts at\neliminating the repression of the commodity fetish in language. The\nsurrealists are a particularly positivist manifestation: dream narrative\ncannot break the narrative fetish for it lies within its boundaries. Joyce\nattempts to get back to language but for him language is not 'Saussu-\nrian but is etymologies. Hemmingway attempts an art of the sentence\nin which the ordering of the objects preceeds the ordering of the words\n(in that view, to get to language you must forget the words). The\nprjectivist tendency from Pound and Williams to Eshleman and\nKelly tries to get a new theory of the ordering of words, even a\nphysical one, but it is highly individualist and predicated upon a\n\nmetaphoric relation of the page to \u2018scored speech.\u2019\n\nIt is not an accident that every modernist approach has failed.\nBecause they start within the commodity fetish of language, they can\nquickly be reduced to commodities in turn. This is enough to kill\nthem. Let me present a picture as ugly as it is real. With very few\nexceptions, a modern poet is successful as a commodity for no more\nthan five years. During this period he or she is in constant demand for\nreadings, has a plethora of publications (leading inevitably to over-\nproduction) and is the subject of numerous critical articles, books, etc.\n\nConsider what happens when over-production (not of poems, but\nof commodities, books of poems) hits a poet. People who have read\nhim or her now begin to stop. The market drops out and, in turn, a\nnew poet is elevated, becomes chic and is similarly chewed up by the\nprocess. I can think of numerous examples: Robert Kelly, Jim Tate,\nRobert Duncan, Clayton Eshleman, Denise Levertov, Anne Wald-\nman, anyone you care to name.\n\nThe \u2018art of the difficult\u2019 aspect of modernism is a defense\nmechanism. By difficulty, a writer makes it harder to be absorbed and\ncommoditized. It is a form of buying time. It is a sad thing to watch. It\nnever works.\n\nLanguage-centered writing, which this is, has a direct historical\npredecessor in Russian Futurism. These groups have two things in\ncommon which suggest a higher order of struggle: (i) they place\nlanguage at the center of their work, (2) they place their work directly\ninto a program of conscious and active class-struggle. They recognize\nthat every creative act is, in its essence, revolutionary. For art has a dual\nfunction: interiorizing the group by ordering sense perceptions\n(leading to group culture and group consciousness) and by connecting\nthe individual writer with the \u2018other,\u2019 which is the world of his or her\ngroup. It is just these dialectical forms and connections which the\nrepressing element of the commodity fetish attempts to hide.\n\nRussian Futurism took place in a revolutionary period, but one\nwhich resulted not in a communist state, but in a state capital one. The\nnarrative fetish of social realism is the highest form of the commodity\nfetish. What took place in Russia was a later form of the nineteenth\ncentury bourgeois revolutions. Thus Russian Futurism was a\ncounter-tendency, which is to be expected whenever the historical\nmoment is in great flux. When the stage of historical development it\narose in passed, its days were numbered.\n\nLanguage-centered writing can take many forms. It is first of all\nactivity conscious of itself. Its attempt is the spelling out of all the\ndeformations of language which result from the repressing\nmechanism of the commodity fetish. It discusses the world and does\nnot describe it. It does not impose \u2018reality\u2019 on the reader by fiat. It calls\n\nattention to the words it is using. It shows that the great rush of energy\none gets in any good poem is nothing other than dialectical conscious-\nness itself. It is not the \u2018end of the novel\u2019 nor of literary criticism, but is\ntheir return to the poem itself.\n\nIt is the first step (and only that) of the return of the poem to the\npeople. It is a politicized poem and not a \u2018political poem\u2019 (which is a\ncounter-tendency occurring within the commodity fetish). It tells you\nthat these words are empty until you fill them with your presence,\nreading them, being them. Together, you and these words could do\nanything.\n\nPermanent Revolution,\n\nRon.\n\nIf understood too generally, the term product can be misleading. It is\nnot another term for commodity, but rather is the inverse: a separate\nnature inherent in the object diametrically opposed to its commodity\nnature. In Lacanian terminology, such an object would be considered\n\u2018overdetermined.\u2019 In a recent essay on the social origins of referen-\ntiality (\u2018Disappearance of the Word, Appearance of the World,\u2019 Red\nHerring, forthcoming), I use the terms gesture and gestural to indicate\nthe product nature of language in both tribal poetics and that of post-\ntribal pre-capitalist societies:\n\nIn its primary form, reference takes the character of a gesture and an object,\nsuch as the picking up of a stone to be used as a tool. Both gesture and object\ncarry their own integrities and are not confused: a sequence of gestures is\ndistinct from the objects which may be involved, as distinct as the labour\nprocess is from its resultant commodities. A sequence of gestures forms a\ndiscourse, not a description. It is precisely the expressive integrity of the\ngestural nature of language which constitutes the meaning of the \u2018nonsense\u2019\nsyllables in tribal poetries; its persistence in such characteristics of Skelton\u2019s\npoetry as its rhyme is that of a trace.\n\nIt is just this capability of capitalism to render a portion of the world\ninvisible which Marx had in mind when, in the Preface to a Contribution\nto the Critique of Political Economy, he wrote that\n\nIt is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but on the\ncontrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.\n\nSome other applications of this repressive capacity of capitalist\ndevelopment are discussed quite cogently by John and Barbara Ehren-\nreich in \u2018Work and Consciousness,\u2019 Monthly Review, July-August,\n1976, pp. 10-18."},{"uid":"RonSilliman_fromLanguageWriting_1978","author":"Ron Silliman","shortTitle":"from Language Writing","title":"Ron Silliman | from Language Writing | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn5\/pictures\/027.html","text":"\n\n\n\n\nfrom LANGUAGE WRITING\n\n\nRae says, \u2019\u2019What is your fascination with graphs?\u201d Meaning, I take it, all\nnon-verbal presentations of information within the body of the text:\n\n\nor\n\n\nmusic\n\n\nperception\n\n\nspeech\n\n\nthe visible\n\n\nThere are (millions of) relations in the world which even the most poly-\nsemic sentence can only serve to distort.

However, very little does. Why?\n\n      Language is simultaneously a product of human activity & a critical\nmediator between the individual & all else. Any privilege it may possess\nas a sign system rests with its social role as the code thru wch most,\nif not all, meaning becomes manifest, explicit, conscious\u209c\n\n      Language is one strategic part of the total social fact, So is art\n\n\n(including lit). Beyond, if not before, art\u2019s long-recognized function\nof the transmission of ideology is its role as the tuning mechanism thru\nwch the individual is trained, often unconsciously, to organize her\nresponses to the medium at hand. Thus painting (partially) organizes\nthe code of sight.\n\n     Most art forms encode media that are not, otherwise, the subject of\nformal learning processes, consciously reproduced at the institutional\nlevel (save as instruction in the arts per se). Not so language. The\nposition of writing, both as sign system & art, within the structure of\nthe total social fact is therefore exceptionally complex. Its code is\nthat of manifest perception, comprehension: you know that I know what\nyou mean, because I can tell you in \"my own\u201d words,\n\n     But the words are never our own. Rather, they are our own usages of\na determinate coding passed down to us like all other products of civi-\nlization, organized into a single, capitalist, world economy. Questions\nof national language & those of genre parallel one another in that they\nprimarily reflect positionality within the total, historical, social\nfact. It is important here to keep in mind that new forms occur only at\nthe site of already digested contents, just as, conversely, new contents\noccur only at the site of already digested forms.\n\n     Thus black American poetry, in general, is not language writing\nbecause of what so-called language writing is \u2014 the grouping\ntogether of several, not always compatible, tendencies within \u2019\u2019high\nbourgeois\" literature. The characteristic features of this position\nwithin literature have been known for decades: the educational level of\nits audience, their sense of the historicity of writing itself, the class\norigin of its practitioners (how many, reading this, will be the children\nof lawyers, doctors, ministers, professors?), &, significantly, the\nfunctional declassing of most persons who choose such writing as a life-\nwork.\n\n     Any class struggle for consciousness must occur at different levels\nin the different sectors of the social whole, precisely according to the\nquestion of positionality. Bourgeois literature can either reinforce\nor undermine the historic confidence of the bourgeoisie, that its role,\nif not \"inevitable,\" is at least \"for the best.\" Or not.\n\n     Characteristic of this position in society (& writing) is a high\ndegree of sensitivity to the constituent elements wch enter into the\noverall struggle. That the formalism of modernism (including language\nwriting) both examines such elements in a quasi-scientific fashion,\nwhile often appearing to cleave them from their material base is no\naccident, as all movements in art (however small or explicitly \"anti-\nestablishment\") tend to present both progressive & regressive sides:\nsymbolism brought polysemic overdetermination into consciousness within\nan individualized, romantic ideology.\n\n     All meaning is a construct, built from the determinate code of\n\n\nlanguage. New meanings exist only to the extent that they have been\npreviously repressed, not permitted to reach consciousness. But it is\nnecessary to seek the social base of any meaning not in the self-\nreflexivity of the text, as such, but in its relation to the social\npositionality of its audience & author.\n\n     Unlike most programs, wch are self-limiting, that of writing in the\nframework of capitalism carries within itself the admonition, typical of\nan economy predicated on technical innovation & the concentration of\ncapital, to \"make it new.\" The function of a truly political writing is\nto, first, comprehend its position (most explicitly, that of its audi-\nence) & to bring forth these \"new\" meanings according to a deliberately\npolitical program. Let us undermine the bourgeoisie.\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nPARTICULARS: in re MacLow\n\n     I find no great evidence that Jackson MacLow \"admire(s)\" my work\n\"for all the wrong reasons.\" I myself endeavor to read sensitively,\nintelligently & critically, his own writing, wch continues to be much\nunderrated in this country. Its general unavailability is part of the\npolitical problem of poetry, a problem wch I do intend to address at\neach moment in my own activity as a poet.\n\n     But his letter in L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E #8 combats my own comments in\n#7\u2019s symposium with more ire than logic. Consider; MacLow argues\nvehemently against my recommendation of Henri Lefebvre\u2019s Dialectical\nMaterialism without One Single Statement as to WHY it represents\n\"Western ideological diseases\"; he goes on to suggest that I am little\nmore than a radio, transmitting the messages of \"the know-it-alls who\nentrap generous spirits such as Ron Silliman into their exploitive\nideological mazes.\"\n\n     I regret to report that I am wholly responsible for my own opin-\nions. Worse, I happily stand behind them.\n\n     That writing & politics are not discrete activities is nowhere\nmore clear than in the fact that Jackson\u2019s complaint is centerd around\nthe problem of definition. The phrase \"anarcho-social-democrat,\" wch\nseems to have pushed his button, is no mystery, nor is it wedded\nprimarily to the Social Democrat Federation, any more than the term\ncommunism can be taken to be synonymous with the Stalinizd CPs with wch\nwe are all too familiar.\n\n     MacLow\u2019s letter robs all such terms of their specific (i.e.,\nfunctional & contextualizd) content, in order to set up an obfuscatory\nfog. This screen enables Jackson to associate me with any & all self-\nannounced socialist tendencies (in the 2nd item of his indictment alone\nit is intimated that I might be a 3rd World nationalist, a Stalinist or\n\n\na Trotskyist!); it also permits him to send forth these volleys from a\nvariety of positions, never having to commit himself to any one of them,\nnor addressing their sometimes glaring internal contradictions (citing,\nfor example, Djilas, a socialist & repentant Yugoslavian Stalinist, in\nsupport of his anti-socialist stance).\n\n     Given MacLow\u2019s refusal to ground his terms, to the extent that I am\nunable to tell whether I\u2019m supposed to represent bureaucratic oligarchies\nor 19th century utopianism, it\u2019s difficult to know just what are \"the\ngoals...Silliman & I both consider desirable\" (my italics). Jackson\u2019s\nown position, however, hovers behind the very next sentence: \"Only\ndogged & persistent & detailed work within the present concrete oppres-\nsive social systems may achieve some advance\" (emphasis mine again).\nMACLOW\u2019S COMMITMENT PERCEIVES NO OTHER CONTEXTUALIZING LONG-TERM GOAL\nTHAN THE MAINTENANCE OF A SYSTEM HE HIMSELF CALLS OPPRESSIVE! Here is\nthe footprint of a social-democrat.\n\n     Understood as such, the incoherence of his general argument is no\naccident. The positions taken are in each instance partial & in no\ninstance correlated to a larger program of political action. No wonder\nthe contribution of cultural work seems to him \"problematical,\"\n\n     But my argument is not with Jackson MacLow, who has at least\nbravely volunteerd himself as a willing target. The idea that progres-\nsive political (& literary) work can be carried out within a context\nthat does not fundamentally challenge the existing \"concrete oppressive\"\neconomic relations of the world is typical not merely of members of\nsocial-democratic parties, but of most of the poets in the United\nStates, specifically including those who associate themselves with\nL=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.\n\n     All behavior, including poetry, possesses a political dimension.\nUnfortunately for us all, this domain is set within an overlapping\nmultiplicity of social codes wch reciprocally mediate one another, so\nthat no one aspect may be identified as the arena for \"correct\" work to\nthe exclusion of others. Nevertheless, two relations seem to me\ncritical, insofar as no further sorting out of other realms is possible\nwithout them. One is the relation to audience, wch is specific for\neach writer & each work. The second is the relation to a program, wch\nmeans an articulatable set of goals, both long & short term.\n\n     If I write a newspaper story about landlord-tenant relations in San\nFrancisco\u2019s Tenderloin one day, an essay for L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E the next\n& work on my poem Tjanting the third, these relations shld be calld into\nplay in ways that can be examind. The audience for the story will differ\nfrom those for either the essay or the poem, & I imagine the audience\nfor the essay to be more restricted (focusd, if you will) than for\nTjanting. Each, however, shld lead the reader toward a general program\n(making tangible, for example, the ways in wch capitalism harms &\ndeforms every individual it touches within the relations that define\n\n\neach of these distinct relationships), In each instance, it shld be\nclear that solutions are not to be sought \u2019\u2019within the present concrete\noppressive social systems.\u201d At best, one can achieve new staging areas\nfor further, more effective, struggle within these systems.\n\n     By now it shld be evident that I do believe I cld carry on my\npoetic production within a dictatorship of the working class (a concept\nI specifically endorse), because all forms of literature are class-\nspecific & these classes will not cease to exist on the day on wch state\npower is transferrd from one to another. My poetry recognizes an\naudience that possesses a bourgeois origin, is educated (to the point\nof being conscious of literary history), predominantly white & even\nmale. The body of individuals wch make up this class has a specific\nhistory, specific internal relations (viz. Bernstein\u2019s note on group\nformation in #8), & a specific future. Unlike Baraka\u2014with whom I\nprofoundly disagree\u2014, becoming political does not mean abandoning this\naudience, but making it instead look at itself. The need for such\nunderstanding is not only not about to \u2019\u2019wither away,\u201d it will be height-\nend if & when the events of history, for wch we are responsible, trans-\nform our lives.\n\n"},{"uid":"RonSilliman_LouisZukofsky_1978","author":"Ron Silliman","shortTitle":"Louis Zukofsky","title":"Ron Silliman | Louis Zukofsky | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn4\/pictures\/001.html","text":"\n            LOUIS ZUKOFSKY\n\n\n\n     The first (& for a long time the only) to read Pound & Williams with\nwhat we wld recognize as modern eye & ear.

Our investigation begins with the\nanalysis of the book.\n\n     The book is, first of all, an external object, a thing which through\nits qualities satisfies human needs of a literary kind.\n\n     Objects of reading become books only because they are the products\nof the writing of private individuals who work independently of each\nother. The sum total of the writing of all these private individuals\nforms the aggregate writing of society. Since the writers do not come\ninto social contact until they exchange the products of their writing^\nthe specific social characteristics of their private writings appear\nonly within this exchange.

To the\nwriters, therefore, the social relations between their private writing\nappear as what they are, i.e. , they do not appear as direct social rela-\ntions between persons in their work, but rather as material relations\nbetween persons and social relations between texts.\n\n     However, a text can be useful, and a product of human writing, with-\nout being a book.

It is the very partialness of this determination which makes\npossible much of the confusion among poets, particularly on the left, as to the locus, structure and\npossibilities of literary production's ideological component. Any commodity is necessarily an object\nand has a physical existence, even if this aspect is no more than the vibrating vocal chords of a sound\npoet. But not all objects are commodities. That which exists in nature and has a use, such as water, is\na good \u2014 the hiker comes to the stream and drinks. Only that which is produced for its utility\nachieves the status of product (the water is piped to a metropolitan reservoir and filtered). Of\nproducts, only those which are made for exchange (and specifically exchange for money) become\ncommodities (Perrier).\n\n        The writer who composes a work and reveals it to no one, keeping it instead confined to her\nnotebook, nonetheless has created a product which possesses real useful value (part of which may be\nin the writing process) for its lone consumer. Likewise, two poets trading photocopies of their latest\nworks are exchanging products. And even to the extent that a small press edition of a book of poems\nmay have a certain portion of its run set aside for the author in lieu of royalties, and that many of\nthose copies will be given away, it also will suffer a divided identity.\n\n        Yet books and texts do not exist at quite the same level, nor are they produced by exactly the\nsame people. Further muddying the situation is the subsidization in most of the English-speaking\nnations of both writers and publications by the state. To what degree can we use the term commodity\nto describe a book sold in a store when its publisher has no hope of recouping her original costs, and\nwhen these losses will be at least partly absorbed by a third party? Is its commodification then\nnothing more than a strategy for maximum circulation, so that the volume might achieve a greater\nproduct-function? Should government patronage be seen as a metaconsumpion in which what is\npurchased is not textual, but simply the existence of poets and poetry as an ornament to the national\nculture?\n\nfor San Francisco NAM\n\n        Perhaps, but more important to the equation is the simple presence of consumption,\neconomic consumption, mediated or otherwise, for the role it plays, however dimly perceived by\nindividual authors, in motivating the production of texts for exchange. It was just this which Laura\nRiding discovered without being able to name in her 1926 essay 'T.E. Hulme, the New Barbarism,\n& Gertrude Stein,' when she complained of 'the forced professionalization of poetry'. The poet who\n\n\n\nwrites with the idea of having her poems published, of having them collected into books and\ndistributed through stores and direct mail purchases (which may at this point be the larger sector of\nthe market), has inescapably been drawn into the creation of commodities.\n\n         What is significant about this case of determination in the last instance is how it reflects the\nstructure of that other exchange with which poetry is associated: the production and consumption of\nsigns. The book, a commodity, radically alters the composition and potential size of an audience in\naddition to physically displacing the presence of the writer. Communication, when it occurs, does not\ntake place between ideals, either on the head of a pin or in space. Literary theory since the time of the\nNew Critics has done much to elaborate the possible meanings in a given text, yet has remained\nessentially silent about the constraints placed on these contents by the social features of any concrete,\nparticular audience. This absence banishes any three-dimensional consideration of the ideological\ncomponent, which is reduced instead to a question of the politics of the writer or, at best, those of\nindividual characters: an example would be Eagleton's discussion of George Eliot in Criticism and\nIdeology.\n\n         (Yet, except in the event of self-publishing, the author is not the sole producer of the book,\nand a rather different and more complex message is given when a work such as George Jackson's\nSoledad Brother is published by Bantam Books, the largest U.S. mass market paperback firm\n(controlling 18% of one of the most concentrated sectors of its industry, with just 8 corporations\naccounting for 84% of all sales in 1977), which itself is a holding of the German multi-national\npublisher Gruner & Jahr, three-quarters of which is owned by a still larger German publisher,\nBertellsmann Gutersloh, with the remaining portion in the hands of the Agnelli family of Italy,\nwhose fortune was built on Fiat.\u00b9\n\n         The role of the reader in the determination of ideological content is neither abstract nor\nbeyond the scope of feasible examination. The question is contextual, not textual. As early as 1929,\nValentin Volosinov wrote:\n\nThe actual reality of language speech is not the abstract system of linguistic forms, not the isolated monologic utterance, and not the\npsychophysiological act of its implementation, but the social event of verbal interaction implemented in an utterance or utterances.\n\n         Thus, verbal interaction is the basic reality of language.\n\n         Dialogue, in the narrow sense of the word, is, of course, only one of the forms \u2014 a very important form, to be\nsure \u2014 of verbal interaction. But dialogue can also be understood in a broader sense, meaning not only direct, face-to-face,\nvocalized verbal communication between persons, but also verbal communication of any type whatsoever. A book, i.e., a\nverbal performance in print, is also an element of verbal communication. It is something discussable in actual, real-life\ndialogue, but aside from that, it is calculated for active perception, involving attentive reading and inner responsiveness, and\nfor organized, printed reaction in the various forms devised by the particular sphere of verbal communication in question\n(book reviews, critical surveys, defining influence on subsequent works, and so on). Moreover, a verbal performance of this\nkind also inevitably orients itself with respect to previous performances in the same sphere, both those by the same author\nand those by other authors. It inevitably takes its point of departure from some particular state of affairs involving a\n\n\nscientific problem or a literary style. Thus the printed verbal performance engages, as it were, in ideological colloquy of large\nscale: it responds to something, objects to something, affirms something, anticipates possible responses and objections, seeks\nsupport, and so on.\n\n          Any utterance, no matter how weighty and complete in and of itself, is only a moment in the continuous process of\nverbal communication. But that continuous verbal communication is, in turn, itself only a moment in the continuous, all-\ninclusive, generative process of a given social collective. An important problem arises in this regard: the study of the\nconnection between concrete verbal interaction and the extraverbal situation \u2014 both the immediate situation and, through\nit, the broader situation. The forms this connection takes are different, and different factors in a situation may, in\nassociation with this or that form, take on different meanings (for instance, these connections differ with the different\nfactors of situation in literary or scientific communication). Verbal communication can never be understood and explained\noutside of this connection with a concrete situation.\u00b2\n\nVolosinov's presumptions parallel those of Walter Benjamin's concerning copies in 'The Work of Art\nin the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,' and his work was not unknown to members of the Prague\nLinguistics Circle, yet prior to the establishment of semiotics as a positive study the common\nwisdom, in the words of Wellek (a Prague alumnus) and Warren, was that 'the real poem must be\nconceived as a structure of norms, realized only partially in the experience of its many readers.' Their\nargument for this in Theory of Literature is a thorough assault on all contextual approaches. This\nreads, in part:\n\nWhat is the 'real' poem; where should we look for it; how does it exist ... ?\n\n          one of the most common and oldest answers is the view that a poem is an 'artefact', an object of the same nature\nas a piece of sculpture or a painting. Thus the work of art is considered identical with the black lines of ink on white paper\nor parchment or, if we think of a Babylonian poem, with the grooves in the brick. Obviously this answer is quite\nunsatisfactory. There is, first of all, the huge oral 'literature'. There are poems or stories which have never been fixed in\nwriting and still continue to exist. Thus the lines in black ink are merely a method of recording a poem which must be\nconceived as existing elsewhere. If we destroy the writing or even all copies of a printed book we still may not destroy the\npoem, as it might be preserved in oral tradition or in the memory of a man like Macaulay, who boasted of knowing Paradise\nLost and Pilgrim's Progress by heart. On the other hand, if we destroy a painting or a piece of sculpture or a building, we\ndestroy it completely, though we may preserve descriptions or records in another medium and might even try to reconstruct\nwhat has been lost. But we shall always create a different work of art (however similar), while the mere destruction of the\ncopy of a book or even of all its copies may not touch the work of art at all.\n\n          That the writing on the paper is not the 'real' poem can be demonstrated also by another argument. The printed\npage contains a great many elements which are extraneous to the poem: the size of the type, the sort of type used (roman,\nitalic), the size of the page, and many other factors. If we should take seriously the view that a poem is an artefact, we would\nhave to come to the conclusion that every single copy or, at least, every different printed edition is a different work of art.\nThere would be no a priori reason why copies in different editions should be copies of the same book. Besides, not every\nprinting is considered by us, the readers, a correct printing of a poem. The very fact that we are able to correct printer's\nerrors in a text which we might not have read before or, in some rare cases, restore the genuine meaning of the text shows\nthat we do not consider the printed lines as the genuine poem. Thus we have shown that the poem (or any literary work of\n\n\nart) can exist outside its printed version and that the printed artefact contains many elements which we all must consider as\nnot included in the genuine poem.\n\n         Still, this negative conclusion should not blind us to the enormous practical importance, since the invention of\nwriting and printing, of our methods of recording poetry. There is no doubt that much literature has been lost and thus\ncompletely destroyed because its written records have disappeared and the theoretically possible means of oral tradition have\nfailed or have been interrupted. Writing and especially printing have made possible the continuity of literary tradition and\nmust have done much to increase the unity and integrity of works of art.\u00b3\n\nWhile the Saussurean bias against writing as anything more than a shadow of speech is evident\nenough in this classic passage, more telling (at least for its impact on all subsequent literary theory) is\nthe demand of a single aspect of the work which can be elevated to the status of real or genuine. In\nthe cause of textual analysis, Wellek and Warren succeeded in delegitimating the fuller study of\nliterature as a total social process.\n\n         This is not to be confused with the dialectical method of moving from the concrete to the\nabstract in order to identify principles and structures with which to return to concrete praxis. Wellek\nand Warren's idealization of the text is a complete rupture, achieved by a stylistic sleight of hand\n(writing is only a record of speech, yet oral work is only literature in quotes, severing the text from\nany material finality). Combined with their insistence on some level or aspect of the poem being\ndefined as genuine, this dematerialization conspires to make 'possible the continuity of literary\ntradition' and 'increase the unity ... of works of art' by banishing investigations of difference at other\nlevels.\n\n         These 'less real' regions of literary production and consumption are of consequence. The\ncareer (and meaning) of William Carlos Williams is organized quite differently if one concludes, as\nmany young poets now do, that its finest work is to be found in Spring & All and the other books\ncomposed between 1920 and '32 which are presently available in the volume\n\nImaginations. Yet several of the 'New American' poets of the 50s are on record as having been\nprimarily influenced by Williams' 1944 collection The Wedge. This means that young writers\nperceive the stamp of Williams' example, teaching and prestige on the work of their immediate\npredecessors as having a value other than that presumed by those somewhat older poets. One who\nbears that mark heavily, such as Lew Welch, is apt to become marginalized by the process. (Similarly,\nthe influence of Paul Blackburn is fading fast.)\n\n         Spring & All was not available in the 1950s, though the poems in it were included (in an\naltered order) in The Collected Earlier Poems. To be certain, the texts themselves did not change, but\ntheir inaccessibility blocked communication, and by the time Harvey Brown's Frontier Press brought\nthem back to a possible public, the audience itself had been transformed: In addition to their having\nexperienced a greatly expanded educational system in the 60s, a war in Viet Nam which had already\n\n\ngone sour and familiarity with psychedelics, the new readers of Spring & All had often already\nassimilated the work of Olson, O'Hara, Creeley and others.\n\n        An even clearer example of the literary difference of different editions can be found in Jim\nCarroll's Basketball Diaries, a teenage memoir of sex, drugs and rock-n-roll which over 15 years went\nthrough piecemeal appearances in little poetry magazines, a slick small press edition and finally\nemerged, if that is the word, as a mass market paperback \u2014 which was reviewed and even excerpted\nin the nation's sports pages. At one end of this spectrum is a group of readers who found in Carroll a\nnatural, even primitive, tough-lyric prose style, embodying many of the principles held by writers\nassociated with Saint Mark's Church in New York and articulated most forcefully by Ted Berrigan.\nAt the other end is a group of readers who may never have heard of Ted Berrigan and for whom the\nconsiderations of style, without which the Diaries would never have been printed, are utterly beside\nthe point.\n\n        Robert Gl\u00fcck offers a further example in Caricature, a talk given in San Francisco's 80\nLangton Street series:\n\nAt several Movement readings I was interested to see members of the audience come up afterwards and say where the writer\nhad got it right (yes, that's my life) and where the writer had got it wrong. I want to contrast this with the audience that\nadmires writing as if it were a piece of Georgian silver, goods to be consumed. Of course this depends on an identification\nwith a community, a shared ideology. For example, I read a story at a gay reading about being 'queer-bashed.' The audience\nresponded throughout with shouts of encouragement and acknowledgement. Afterwards people told me I got it right. I read\nthe same story to an appreciative and polite university audience, and afterwards people told me they admired my transitions.\nTo a certain extent, my story registered only in terms of form.\u2074\n\nThis, however, is only a superficial attempt at a left analysis, in that Gl\u00fcck implicitly reproduces the\nWellek-Warren presumption of 'correctness,' merely substituting a preferred definition (which avoids\naddressing the political question of what is accomplished by correctness: the delegitimization of\nsomething, and by fiat, not argument). The characterization of an 'audience that admires writing as\nif it were a piece of Georgian silver' is in fact incorrect. What is omitted is that this second group's\nresponse is conditioned on their identification with Gl\u00fcck as a writer (and\/or, most probably, as an\nintellectual because he writes), where what is shared is not the experience of homophobic violence,\nbut the problems of a craft. Moreover, Jim Carroll is no longer a junkie or prostitute, and the\nmotivations of the readers of his Bantam paperback may well have more to do with voyeurism than a\ncommon ideology.\n\n        What can be communicated through any literary production depends on which social codes\nare available to its audience. The potential contents of the text are only actualized according to their\nreception, which depends on the composition of the receivers. The work of Clark Coolidge, for\nexample, would only seem opaque and forbidding at a gay reading, for the same reason that a\n\n\nJapanese speaker cannot communicate with an Italian: no codes are shared from which to translate\nfrom word to meaning. Now there may be several people at a gay reading who are as interested as\nCoolidge in geology, bebop, Salvador Dali, weather and even the same kinds of writing problems,\nbut these concerns are not what bring people to such an event.\n\n        Context determines (and is determined by) the composition of the audience. Context\ndetermines the actual, real-life consumption of the literary product, without which communication\nof a message (formal, substantive, ideological) cannot occur. Context determines (and is determined\nby) both the motives of the readers and their experience, their history, i.e., their particular set of\npossible social codes. It tells us very little to know only that one group was a 'gay reading' and the\nother a \u2018university audience.' A school with a large English department and a creative writing degree\nis entirely different from a school focusing on science or agriculture. A reading to a graduate level\nclass in rhetoric is not the same as another to the general student body.\n\n        It is here at the question of context, a place that does not even exist within the system of\nWellek and Warren, that both Riding and Gl\u00fcck complain in their very different ways of the 'forced\nprofessionalization' of poetry. We can see here also that the 'continuity of literary tradition' and the\n'unity ... of works of art' is not a partial truth, but a calculated fabrication that expresses more clearly\nthan its authors could have known, the ideology of late capitalism. Their 'us, the readers,' able to\ndetermine 'a correct printing of a poem' and capable of restoring 'the genuine meaning of the text' is\nnot just any reader, but a particular one, unnamed, with a particular education and occupation.\nGl\u00fcck (although he fails to distinguish between the worker's concern for the quality and manufacture\nof her product and the attitude of a collector of Georgian silver) is an improvement to the degree that\nthis 'best reader' is named.\n\n        Wellek and Warren, however, are not solely responsible for the 'continuity of literary\ntradition' made possible by the banishment of all the other, different readers. They merely gave it a\ncritical cloak of respectability. The phenomenon they reflect is the emergence in the 2oth century of\nthe large, corporate publisher, a transformation of the earlier entrepreneurial one (who nonetheless\ncontinues into the present, most especially in the 'small press' or 'independent' sector). The\nadvantage of the large publisher is size. Capital enables it to attract popular writers, produce\nindividual units less expensively, distribute effectively and to advertise substantially. A correlation can\nbe shown to exist between what is advertised and what is reviewed in most, if not all, of the\n'important' critical journals.\n\n        In the late 1960s, the Mafia attempted to take over the marijuana industry on the west coast,\nincorporating or executing many major importers and dealers, most notably Superfly. Their idea was\nthat by controlling the market, they could set the price artificially high, reaping large profits.\nUnfortunately for them, the continual emergence of new entrepreneurs and the improved quality of\nhomegrown made control impossible (although the cost of American land, labor and legal fees\n\n\nsubsequently pushed prices up somewhat). Like marijuana, publishing (and especially marginal\nsubsectors like poetry) is structurally resistant to monopolization. Although corporations have grown\nsignificantly in the industry, the same percentage of producers tend to control the same percentage of\ntitles and sales as they did in 1930 according to Who Owns the Media?\n\n         This, however, is only a fraction of the story. During this period of corporate growth, a\nnumber of other developments have occurred. Among these are the absolute growth of U.S.\npopulation, which has doubled since 1940, an increase in the percentage of Americans who receive\nsome college education, changes in the technology of publishing which greatly reduce unit cost for\neven small producers, major changes in the composition of American industry and its workforce,\nboth away from an emphasis on manufacture and toward greater specialization in both work and (not\ncoincidentally) lifestyles. One major result has been that while in the period 1911-15, the average\nnumber of new titles and editions published each year was 11,200 and was still under 12,000 per year\nas late as 1955, the annual figure has since rocketed to more than 42,000. While, according to\nClayton Carlson of Harper & Row, some 4% of all titles are poetry, or nearly 1700 of the current\ntotal, the average number of which are published by the major trade houses has remained under 6o\n(and this figure is artificially high, as totals jumped during a period when the federal government\nsubsidized library purchasing: an adjusted figure for the period 1955-77 would be 41 books per year).\nMajor trade publishers account for roughly 3-5 % of all poetry in book form in the U.S.\n\n         No reliable figures exist documenting the number of sales per title for poetry. An informal\nsurvey of independent publishers, bookstore managers, and distributors, leads me to believe that it\nmay be as few as 100. One major distributor of poetry sells less than 17 copies per title per year. (At\nthis rate, the total number of poetry volumes sold in one year, 168.000, is fewer than the number of\nreported rapes, 192,000.)\n\n         Meager as they are, these figures are vastly inflated by the presence of state subsidies. Over\nthe past two years, the National Endowment has made $780,000 in small press grants, $1,538,000 in\ngrants to little magazines, and $1,100,000 in Creative Writing Fellowships to poets. Presuming sales\nof 100 per title at an average retail price of $4, grants to small presses alone equals 58% of the full\nretail value of poetry sold in the United States.\n\n         Subsidization has also helped to make possible the considerable decentralization of literary\ncommunities away from the 'hegemonic' New York trade publishers. Wellek and Warren's\ncomments, it should be noted, came at a time when the number of titles published each year had not\nyet begun its vast expansion. In 1949, 55 titles was probably closer to 12% of all books of poetry\npublished, rather than less than 4%. The claim to a homogeneous literary tradition, which the trades\npublished the major works of, was accordingly harder to challenge. Now it seems ludicrous.\n\n         Even with subsidies, there is not enough capital in the entire poetry industry to directly\nsupport poets and publisher. This partly determines who will turn elsewhere to make a living. Thus\n\n\npoets as a group have a wide range of jobs. This in turn means both that poets see work (and the\npolitics of the workplace) in a non-uniform manner from a variety of perspectives and are less likely\nto perceive poetry as work (at least in the sense of the politics which would extend from that\nperception). It partly explains why so much of the discussion of the politics of literature has been\nfixated on the lone aspect of content.\n\n         Limited and partially determined by economics, the social organization of poetry in the\nmodem period is characterized by two primary structures: the network and the scene.\n\n         The scene, a form which predates even the origin of writing, is specific to a place, such as\nBolinas or Harlem. Because poets and their consumers can meet physically, little capital is required\n(at least in the initial stages): poetry reading series cost far less than a single book to produce. Because\nthe writers in any given locale are going to differ greatly in their other social features, scenes tend to\nbe very heterogeneous, especially in their aesthetics. This tends to have an important impact on\nformal development, which evolves less on its own terms and more on those ('extra-literary') aspects\nheld in common. Hence the personalism which characterizes the current under-30 generation of 'St.\nMark's poets.' Among such scenes are those posed by Gl\u00fcck's gay reading, although it is essential\nhere that the scene definition of something as transgeographic as sexual orientation is specifically an\nearly stage of group evolution.\n\n         Networks are transgeographic by definition and therefore historically quite recent,\ndepending not merely on the creation of the book, but also its 'easy' distribution. In English, the first\nwave of modernists whose work was associated with Poetry, particularly the imagists, had significant\nnetwork characteristics to their scene. The Objectivists were the first poets in America for whom the\nnetwork structure superceded any scene definition.\n\n         What causes poets (and their audience) to engage in network formation is a concern for a\ncertain social code (e.g., gayness) or set of them. Because the cost of communication by books, mail,\nlong distance telephone and travel is much greater than that required by a scene, networks tend to\ninclude fewer poor people. This has obvious implications for groups with transgeographic social\ncodes, such as skin color, which have been historically used by others as a mechanism for insuring\ngroup poverty (and this is why the large trade publishers have played such a major role in what little\nnetwork formation black poets have achieved to date). Because selection to a network is far less\nrandom than to a scene, the social code(s) which defines them and permits communication can\nevolve very rapidly. This is particularly true when the code is perceived as being only, or primarily,\naesthetic, where formal development is a conscious element of the code. (In spite of Black Mountain,\nCreeley has maintained that it was the geographic separateness of individuals in that group and the\nnecessity of having to put their ideas down in writing in letters in order to communicate which\ncaused them to become so stylistically distinct.) Here is the 'forced professionalization' of poetry, in\nwhich long and close association with a social code permits each word a poet writes to rapidly fill\n\n\nwith its own sense of literary history and theory, the stored value of earlier labor. This is one reason\nwhy many contemporary network forms are thought 'difficult.' Because of the use of the code itself as\na selector for membership in the network, the production tends to be much more homogeneous\naesthetically.\n\n         Networks and scenes never exist in pure forms. Networks usually involve scene\nsubgroupings, while many scenes (although not all) build toward network formations. Individuals\nmay belong to more than one of these informal organizations at one time.\n\n         Both types are essentially fluid and fragile. Networks, however, are somewhat more apt to\ndisband altogether. Of the scenes and networks presented in the Allen anthology only 20 years ago,\njust the New York school possesses some present manifestation, and that is quite different in\npersonnel and substance (and has in fact involved subdivision into relatively distinct groupings).\n\n         Because capital, of which there is so little in poetry, is necessary for the elements of network\nformation, competition exists between networks and scenes. Underneath lies the hidden assumption\nof a hierarchical ordering of these groups, and the idea that one can be the dominant or hegemonic\nformation according to some definition, at least for a period of time. Definitions vary, but the major\ncomponents are monetary rewards, prestige (often called influence), and the capacity to have one's\nwork permanently in print and being taught.\n\n         Here the role of trade publishing and its allies is completely clear. Trades may produce only\n3.5 % of all poetry titles, but in an anthology such as The American Poetry Anthology they represent\n54% of all books used as sources for the collection. University presses contributed another 31%.\nNearly half of the remaining small press books came from one press, which was the editor's own.\n\n         Trade publishing is the metanetwork of American poetry. It is the contemporary\nmanifestation of the academic network that wellek and warren argued for more than 30 years ago,\nand a faculty position remains a primary social feature. But because this is the network which is\naligned with capital, it can and does incorporate poets from other groups on a token basis. While this\nserves to give them much broader distribution, they in turn legitimate the metanetwork, masking to\nsome degree its very network structure.\n\n         This alliance with capital yields another major advantage: the relative efficiency of trade\ndistribution virtually guarantees its predominance on college course reading lists, which is the largest\nsingle market for books of poetry, with 2500 colleges and 200 writing programs in North America.\n\n         So long as capital, in the form of corporate publishers, can substantially determine the\ndistribution of poetry in its major market, and so long as Daniel Halperns can call a collection of\ntheir network The American Poetry Anthology without challenge, this type of hegemony is not apt to\nbe broken. The competition between the other networks and scenes amounts to little more than\njockeying for the token slots in the metanetwork.\n\n\n         But this is neither the only mode of hegemony, nor necessarily the most important, which a\npoet such as Robert Gl\u00fcck understands. Here the question is not whether a poet will be read in five\nor fifty years, but whether that poet can and will be read by those people able and willing to act on\ntheir increased understanding of the world as a result of the communication. The people who read\nand believe The American Poetry Anthology are seldom those people. Even the blacks and feminists in\nthat book are reduced to examples of capital's well-publicized tolerance. But what Gl\u00fcck fails to say is\nthat the audience he seeks and the one he dismisses are not composed in the same manner, and\ncannot be adequately addressed in the same way. Even when appropriately addressed, the responses\nwould differ. What does seem evident from his own description is that Gl\u00fcck did not communicate\nanything to the university group to challenge their ideas about transitions, about how subjective\ncontinuity is an ideological product, and through this to the idea that meaning is a construct, and\nsomething which is always produced with social intentions.\n\n         The failure to adjust one's presentation to account for differing compositions of audience is\noften due to partial or overlapping membership in each of the groups. In addition, it's a characteristic\nof the social code of just the groups most often apt to attend a college reading not to know or speak\ntheir own name. In labelling them consumers, Gl\u00fcck forgets that consumption for further production\nis a moment of production itself. But to identify them as a coalition of writers, teachers and\nspecialized readers falls short of connecting them to those larger social orders of which they are a\nstrategic fragment.\n\n         This self-anonymity has parallels throughout contemporary life. It has only been through the\nstruggle of non-whites, of women and of gays that the white male heterosexual has come into\nrecognition of his own, pervasive presence. In poetry, there continues to be a radical break between\nthose networks and scenes which are organized by and around the codes of oppressed peoples, and\nthose other 'purely aesthetic' schools. In fact, the aesthetics of those schools is a direct result of\nideological struggle, both between networks and scenes, and within them. It is characteristic of the\nclass situation of those schools that this struggle is carried on in other (aesthetic) terms.\n\n         It should be noted here that this struggle is in fact related to the \u2018professionalization\u2019 of\npoetry over the past four centuries. This is not to say that the poet who produces for her own\nconsumption is not involved in struggle, nor in the production and consumption of ideological\nmessages, but that at the level of publishing poets it occurs in a different, specific form. There is in\nfact reason to believe that the absolute number of people who write poetry far exceeds the number of\npeople who ever buy books of the stuff, meaning that the level of professional poetry is itself\nsituational to a larger context, serving as model, limit and problem for the individual self-producer.\n\n         Professional poets include individuals who are bourgeois, petty bourgeois, working class and\neven lumpen. The actual number of poets who could accurately be described as bourgeois is quite\nsmall and may not exceed the 2% figure of the general U.S. population (a figure which implies that\n\n\n90 persons listed in the Directory of American Poets and Fiction Writers either own the means of\nproduction of something more substantial than a small press, or else are related by blood or marriage\nto such ownership). Inversely, the neo-beatnik group (several strong scenes with only a weak network\nstructure) is characterized by the lumpen identification of many of its members.\n\n          But the vast majority fall in between. While many are traditionally working class and while\nthere is a somewhat higher concentration of classically-defined petty bourgeois than in the general\nAmerican economy, the most significant concentration of poets falls into a category that the late\nNicos Poulantzas called The New Petty Bourgeoisie:\n\nThis is also where the current devaluation of educational certificates and attainments is most important, given the\nsignificance that these have on the labour market and for the promotion chances of these agents. It can be seen in the\ncurrently massive occupation of subaltern posts by agents whose educational qualifications led them to have different\naspirations. In actual fact, this is the fraction into which young people holding devalued university degrees gravitate on a\nmassive scale. It leads to the various forms of disguised unemployment that ravages this fraction: various forms of illegal\nwork, vacation work, temporary and auxiliary work. These affect all those fractions with an objectively proletarian\npolarization, but are particularly pronounced in this case.\u2075\n\nPoets, for obvious reasons, tend to look at 'disguised unemployment' as time to write, which partly\nexplains their gravitation to part-time service sector jobs, such as clerking in bookstores or\nproofreading for publishers and law firms. Poulantzas also notes that\n\nIt now seems, however, as if the last few years have seen the development, in the majority of capitalist countries, of an actual\nmental labour reserve army, over and above any cyclical phenomena.\u2076\n\nPoulantzas, however, has a very restricted class model, considering mental work and service sector\nemployment to be unproductive, and therefore excluded from the working class as such (although\nconceding the 'objectively proletarian polarization'). The description, especially with regard to the\nunder-utilized education and partial employment, is a close fit to the lives of many American poets\nunder 40.\n\n          Erik Olin Wright, one of Poulantzas' most vigorous critics, uses a more complex model in\nwhich this same group is categorized as working class with a strong degree of contradiction as to class\nallegiance. Noting that more than 30% of economically active Americans had, by 1969, come into\nthe unproductive mental labor sector, Wright notes that\n\nThe contradictory locations around the boundary of the working class represent positions which do have a real interest in\nsocialism, yet simultaneously gain certain real privileges directly from capitalist relations of production.\u2077\n\n\nAbove all else, professional poetry in America, when it is not aligned directly to an oppressed group,\nreflects struggle within this critical sector carried out, unfortunately, in an unorganized and often\nindividualist manner. The primary ideological message of such poetry lies not in its explicit content,\nideological though that may be, but in the attitude toward reception it demands of the reader. It is\nthis 'attitude toward information,' which often is toward personal (non-professional, non\n\u2014specialized) information, that is carried forward by the recipient. It is this attitude which can form\nthe basis for a response to other information, not necessarily literary, in the future.\n\n         The nature of this attitude lies at the core of every aesthetically based poetic network,\ngenerating the differences between them. While several of the New American poetries of the 50s\npredicated their aesthetics on maximum attention to specific detail (manifesting itself as\nconcentration on word use and line break), only the so-called projectivists suggested the necessity of\nan active relation between form and thinking about form, that is, of information and structure,\nholding up as a value the consciousness of response.\n\n         Because this struggle is carried on in other terms, mediated and hidden, numerous specific\ncomplications occur. One is that members of a given network need not agree on this core attitude in\nthe same way, particularly if surface features are more closely aligned. Another is that writers who\nchange their politics in mid-life often proceed to send forth mixed messages of a high degree, such as\nBaraka or Levertov.\n\n         This is not the sole level in which the ideological component of literary production\nfunctions, but it is the primary one. The use of socially-defined codes (intimacy, law, the professions,\nthe streets, advertising, etc.) and the construction of meaning (Anselm Hollo and Robert Grenier are\ngood examples of a highly developed analysis \u2014 although both would probably disavow the term as\ntoo class-connotative) are two among several others,\n\n         The goal of the poet who would consciously use the ideological component of her work is to\nmake her audience recognize their own presence in the world as part of a dynamic and structured\nseries of relations, to which a variety of options can be applied. Yet what this recognition entails, and\nwhat these options need to be, depends largely on integrating composition of the audience into the\nfield of the writing. The poet who gives the same reading to a university crowd and a gay movement\ngroup is neglecting one of them.\n\n         Just as obviously, different social groups exist for real reasons and will have different poetries.\nOppressed groups have, in a very general sense, a similar direction of struggle which permits coalition\nbuilding across group borders. The problem for aesthetically defined networks and scenes is how to\ndo likewise.\n\nNOTES\n\n\n1  Benjamin M. Compaine, ed. Who Owns the Media?

I would like to point\nout the following:\n\n1)  I am not criticizing Cage, Duchamp, and I suppose by implication\nother members of the \u2019\u2019avant-garde\u201d from an \u2019\u2019automated\u201d viewpoint. I\nknow damn well I don\u2019t know \u2019\u2019who the PEOPLE are\u201d \u2014 I couldn\u2019t begin to\nguess. I don\u2019t claim anyone as \u2019\u2019statistical majority.\u201d The problem is\nsimply this: That this civilization is in the midst of a crisis of\nenormous proportions, a crisis that extends internally through the\n\"invasion of the image\" and externally through the activity of appro-\npriation. That the majority of artists in this country continue to\nignore this crisis (or, fairly enough, argue against its existence).\n(It seems to me for example entirely reasonable to draw a parallel\nbetween Cage\u2019s Thoreau work and fragmentation\/privatization in society,\na state of friction resulting in an unbelievably desperate situation.)\n(One can also imagine the buildings in the South Bronx\u2014 so near the\norigin of this magazine\u2014theoretically considered in a state of\nDECONSTRUCTION------)\n\n\n2)  Along with all of this, I cannot quibble with Dick Higgins about\nwhether or not \u2019\u2019privilege is inherently unfair.\u201d Obviously his know-\nledge of German (read privilege) is not \u2019\u2019unfair\u201d \u2014 on the other hand,\nthe U.S. consumption of world energy (around 30%) seems unfair as does\na great deal in contemporary life. Is poverty (cultural or otherwise)\n\"unfair\u201d? This isn\u2019t irrelevant; it touches on both the context and\nfoundation of culture. (I don\u2019t believe, by the way, that avant-garde\nart is \u2019\u2019native to some\u201d \u2014 I happen to teach it and can witness daily\nthe authoritarianism that accompanies such teaching (this is not a\nvalue judgement) . I find that in the \u2019\u2019REAL WORLD\" (which always seems\ndistant from the university or \"artworld\") there is a surprisingly\nsmall audience for avant-garde work. I don\u2019t believe for a moment\nthat this is solely (or even largely) the problem of ACCESS \u2014 it seems\nto be equally the problem of self-referentiality or closure that\naccompanies such work.)\n\n3)  Higgins asks for \"positive models\" \u2014 I can recommend the work of\n(England) Steve Willats, Tony Rickaby, Conrad Atkinson; (United States)\nRita Myers, Laurie Anderson, Martha Rosler, Dan Graham, Kathy Acker;\n(France) Didier Bay, Annette Messager; (Canada) some of the work around\nthe CEAC group.\n\n4)  I agree with Higgins\u2019 third point to an extent\u2014 the need for the\nexploration of a social hermeneutic. I think of some of Don Bahr\u2019s\nPima\/Papago texts in this light. I might point out that Adorno and\nSchutz have tackled the phenomenology of group performances. I per-\nsonally (within this society) would tend to an analysis of \"massifi-\ncation\" (hate that word) in terms (externally) of \"ratings\" and\n(internally) the globalization and tokenization of the self.\n\n5)  Finally, I did not mean the attack to be directed contra Cage,\nDuchamp, etc.\u2014but only their work, especially the assumptions which\nseem to underly it. None of this would be relevant, but too often\nthese assumptions (writerliness, autonomy, randomness, freedom, etc.)\nare taken for granted, i.e. not understood as the embodiment of a type\nof bourgeois ideology.\n\n"},{"uid":"AlanSondheim_OrangeCountyCaliforniaandtheEconomicsofLanguage_1982","author":"Alan Sondheim","shortTitle":"Orange County California and the Economics of Language","title":"Alan Sondheim | Orange County California and the Economics of Language | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1982","date":1982,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":4.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEvol4\/pictures\/072.html","text":"\n                Orange County California and the Economics of Language\n\n\n\n\n            Alan Sondheim\n\n\n\n\nIf you own a Porsche in Newport Beach you buy a second vehicle for the beach or practicality, you\nwrite 'Porsche' on the back of the pickup, let people know: I'm driving this now, I've got the other.\nThe commodity structure produces bifurcations in the cultural domain: Porsche\/vw; these become\nreified and the social preservation of boundary conditions requires further commodification. The car\nsplits into two functions: the social emblem and the functional implement, retaining the signature of\nthe first.\n\nSomeone talks about rapes perhaps or murder to an extent in the east we speak of groceries in\nconfusion. Everything neutralizes; the objects extrude from 'Porsche,' 'taco,' 'surfboard' into a system\nof equivalences in which objects (eastern things) become tokens of transformations (western things):\nrich car, poor car, beach home, roller derby, L.A. fans, the units are larger, more amorphous. The\nobject disappears, the subject disappears. Language flows as dissolution.\n\nNo objects but symptoms within the bifurcated system that becomes increasingly crippled with each\nnew distinction, the enumeration of abundance. That beach home on rented property sells for\n$220,000, the average home $133,000, the average salary $18,000, 8500 new plots available for\npurchase on Irvine Ranch which does its best to keep an even attenuation of supply in the face of.\nThe symptoms, so many result in a negation of intentionality, not this one against that, but this\nagainst this as the body attempts subsummation of everything, equivalences, parataxis, concatenation,\nconfluence, = and (affordability\/lease\/no purchase) as the polarizations within the sociality of\nconsumerism.\n\n(Aside) In Soviet Writers Look at America, the level of discourse (from them to us, the Other placed\nagainst the fabric of late capitalism) is that of description; the anomic fragmentation of the west is\nmore evident from a position of definable immersion (I feel but I denote, i.e. I am elsewhere) than\ndefinition within an immersive structure (my horizon as the world around me).\n\nThus one has lists of exfoliations from a single source (an impossible catastrophic system of\nsingularities within catastrophe theory) \u2014 users of Coca-Cola \u2014 fragmentations (Warhol, astrology,\nracism), groupings (Greenwich Village posters of Bardot, Dylan, Johnson, King, Picasso), directed\n\n\nconversations, fragments, reports, gestures, minute structures of advertising slogans used either to\norient the report itself or structure the reported American life-world, world of dreams.\n\nWithin Orange County all of this placed along the highway of the page in the sense that roadsigns\nseize function as in the repetitiveness of the bank ad 'give us the business, then give us the business.'\nBrown changes sides, now seems like a 'hardliner,' no one in particular seems perturbed at the\nnoticed difference. It's language at the edge, the margin, of America. Or the weatherman who\nshowed a satellite map of Africa and proceeded to give the weather of the western sahara (always west\nalways west), it all compresses, contradiction ceases when comparison, that algorithm, becomes\nimpossible.\n\nAt the heart of the system, the subject becomes authoritarian through the presence of absence (read:\npotential) or vacuum (read: decay) in the core of attenuation: The neutralization of the even voice,\nsmile, a mass (read: substance) system of gestures (for neutrality itself is intentional) functioning as\nnegation or leveling of the ostensible (marginal, distorted) events in conversation.\n\nThis surface equivalence establishes the equivalence of the events themselves, the temporality of both\nessence and existence, the compression of emotion and information \u2014 a situation in which\nrepresentation (in the sense of an articulated mapping possessing denotation of the world of facts\nembedded in the subsidiary world of 'abstractions') of the thing becomes representation of a quantity\nof the thing (part of a single thing, or thing in quantities) and a quantity of the other (other as\ncultural noise, as emblem, as self-referential sign function); in which the entity or process itself is seen\nonly in terms of its mirrorings (self-reflections, or reflections in the face of the other); in which the\nmirrorings themselves are seen as identical to mirrorings of quantities of the thing combined with\nother things \u2014 noise in the system, cultural noise; in which noise becomes a floating cultural\nsignifier, an operator placing and replacing entities, segments, classes, within the structure of the\ncultural domain, an application (null set as operator, thus X0 = 0 = Y0 through the equivalence of\nanything, through accretion).\n\nThen we move, then we split, then L.A. has the bussing trouble, and there\u2019s trouble in the hills\naround Laguna Beach where in Bluebird Canyon forty homes just fell, the hills north caught fire, o\nhere and there.

The onference title comes from Nietzsche\u2014\"It is\nmy favorite malice and art that my silence has learned not to betray\nitself through reticence.\" A related publication, The Waters of Casa-\nblance (Chelsea #37, $3 from B. DeBoer, 188 High Street, Nutley, NJ\n07110), edited by Luigi Ballerini and Richard Milazzo, makes available\nItalian poetry and essays with similar concerns. Out of London Press,\n12 West 17th Street, New York, NY 10011, will publish the proceedings\nof \"The Favorite Malice\" in 1981. Below, excerpts from some of the work\npresented at the symposium.)\n\n\nThere was need for a \"simple\" kind of language which might find its\nenergy through a continuous shifting of the levels of discourse. Rhythm,\nrather than music, lacerations, rather than recompositions. It is not\nby chance that \"common sense\" is another ever-recurring invocation also\nseen in every attempt at social reaction. Poetry will have to make use\nof language in an unintimidated way to perform endless operations of\nthe \"shifting\" of common sense. Language is the bridge which unites us\nto what we call \"real\" and there is no experience of the \"real\" which\nis not filtered by language, conditioned and conditioning. The task\nand goal of poetic language is above all else to place itself in crisis.\nThe small singable necessary phrase is always that of miniature day to\nday apocalypse: \u2019I will make everything now\u2019. (Antonio Porta, trans-\nlated by D. Scanlon.)\n\nWhat prevents honest tranquility in the craft of poetry is the lack of\na technique of continuity and passage. It seems to me that poetry is\nexiled from the two movements that seem plausible to consider capable\nof establishing the continuation, each in its own way. Derivative\nlanguage is suspended; also, linear logic, wheel of itself or wheelcatch\nworld, machine, now sly now metallic in its clangor, but always avail-\nable, as if to say: let\u2019s reason. Its interruption however does not\nsignify the simple blossoming of the notorious \"other\", of the incessant\nlanguage that never ceases providing movement and sense to things, the\nnatal language, I should say, the shameless swarming beloved, without\npause. At the beginning of the text, there is an interruption. The\nsituation is strange: children infinitely unborn, and at the same time\nfallen from discourse, without language because the only place is lan-\nguage. Because text aims at two things: speaking and simultaneously\nfleeing from discourse. Its occasions are undoubtedly in the world,\nbut it must invent another occasion that is its own. A text is truly\nalone. (Angelo Lumelli, translated by P.S. Salmone.)\n\n\nthe rescinds the nerve solidarious\n\nthe black locust\n\nthe as soon as of almost,\n\nthen dilates the immune\n\nmarrow of the when\n\nthe lattice of it happens\n\nthus it will have been elegant\negg and milk\n\n                (Ballerini, translated by Milazzo)\n\n\nThree great typologies of the mental process preside over the actuali-\nzation of the poetic\u2014a stylistic thinking, a semiological thinking,\n\n\nand a post semiological, or grammatological, or even better a verbal\nthinking. Concerning stylistic thinking\u2083 we can say that it constitutes\nthe foundation of that poetry which bases its modus operand! on the \u2014\nexplicit or implicit\u2014concept of \"erring-from,\" of \"deviation\" from\nthe norm. In this case the presupposition of a norm, of a code (be it\nof an ideological or formal nature), according to which one can use the\ndeviations and transgressions (or even effectuate breakdowns and rup-\ntures), cannot be separated from the realization of the poetic act.\nStylistic thinking embraces almost all avant-garde phenomena with a\ncollective nature (futurism, surrealism, etc.), and also many eversive\nphenomena which have an individual nature, for example, in the case of\nPound. Regarding semiological thinking we can say that it is typical of\nthat poetry which bases its actualization on the presupposition and\nreciprocal correspondence of the signifier and signified, that is, on\nthe idea of \"communication\" (or of a communicativity) which is the idea\ninherent in the very notion of \"sign\". Semiological thinking embraces,\ntherefore, the actualization of that poetry which has a strong commit-\nment to communication\u2014commitment that is also to be understood as a\n(conceptual or moral) exceptionality of the \"message\" to be transmitted.\nThe best example in this regard is given to us from Eliot or in Italy\nfrom Luzzi, even if in the second case the communicability is based on\nthe impossibility of \"truth\" (of \"certainty\") immanent in the message\nbecause of the uncertainty of the affirmation of the \"I\" that is the\nrecipient of experience. Such an \"I\" is, in fact, usually suspended\nbetween sleep and wakefulness, and is therefore incapable of registering\nmental and emotional activity. Examples of poetical works which can be\nascribed to a semiological thinking \u2014 though presumably at a qualita-\ntively lower level \u2014 are all the works with a real ideological (or\n\"popular\") message, as exemplified in Italy by the so-called \"neo-\nrealistic\" movement. Regarding, finally, the post-semiological or\ngrammatological or verbal thinking, we can say that it qualifies that\nsegment of contemporary poetry which operates by giving priority to\nthe awareness of the verbal \"material\" in opposition to both signifi-\ncance and concept. We here refer to that poetry for which language\nconfigures itself in its opacity, density, and, therefore, in its im-\npossibility to move over to meaning or to the conceptual object; poetry\nfor which the word or better still the signifier represents the non-\ncodified and the non-codifiable in the language; that which language\n\"expels\" as non-symbolized residue, but that in where there circulates\nand swarms what Lacan calls the \"real\" (in opposition to \"reality\",\nwhich is instead to be understood as that part of experience elaborated\nas the symbolic or linguistic-ideological level. In this case poetry\nis a primary act because it is found where the language is developed,\nnot so much as a system of communication\u2014vehicle of mental objects or\nstates of consciousness \u2014 but as a \"breakdown of totality\") (Derrida).\nThe \"verbal thought\" on which this poetry is based and which it elabo-\n\n\nrates, results in being the thinking itself of the poem (in as much as\nit is non-conceptual thought); it is the thinking of poetry in as much\nas it is the thought of that Impossible (as Georges Bataille would say)\nthat Lacan again, with explicit reference to this author, defines pre-\ncisely as the \"real.\" (Stefano Agosti, translated by R. Zweig.)\n\nThat which seems to oppose does not oppose itself and\nat the same time contradiction consists, is the signal\nwriting writing itself wants to erase itself, the word wants\nto deny itself saying ( negative\ntracings of the forbidden ) ( the higher cortex:\nthe brain violent against itself: get engine\nmounted on an old buggy )\nthe body proves it, our history written in the body\nwith all the fingers cut off fallen\nin the womb to the mother\nthe shit that mixed with the sperm\n\n                (Porta, translated by Scanlon)\n\nWhat we are speaking of is a \"mental thing\", a \"cosa mentale\", as\nLeonardo da Vinci said, for like things it has the resistance and opac-\nity of that which gives itself to the perceptible contact of the inten-\ntional projection which comes up against it, while unable to dissolve\nor assimilate it into the simple content of a thought, notion or idea.\nIn this way, this resistant and opaque thing forms a \"world\". Our use\nof the term \"to see\" could lead to confusion if one insists on reducing\nit to the visual function. \"To see\" is used here in the sense of \"to\nunderstand\". The entire referential situation is lacking in the lin-\nguistic theses which treat the \"referent\" as a \"real thing of the\nobjective world\", the \"re-presentation\" of which would be the function\nof language. As something seen, the poem is, in itself, its own world,\nwhich is to say, that in referring to itself, it is, at once, a \"refer-\nring\" in the sense specified above and a \"referred to\", in other words,\nvisibility in the process of self-constitution. The peculiarity of the\npoetic situation which is lacking in the linguistic notion of reference\nresides, then, in the poem\u2019s not being able to be grasped as a revealing\n\u2014 revealed world (a referring\u2014referred to) except insofar as it is\nnot a thing, a cultural product, nor a simple representative abstract\nsystem, but rather, a \"worldifying\" \"process\" \"voyance\" and visibility,\nin other words, at the same time. The entire realistic conception of\nthe linguistic \"referent\" breaks down, therefore, as soon as the attempt\nis made to rigorously think through the situation. And so it is that\npoetic text does not \"tell\" of something outside itself, something per-\ntaining to the order of things and facts. Rather it allows being to be.\nBy the power of the word, something which never before was, emerges.\nThrough the temporal and sonorous unfolding of the text and by the act\n\n\nof reading, the world speaks, perpetuates, invents, transforms, and, in\nshort, \"worldifies\" itself.

Oppen-\nheim. )\n"},{"uid":"JohnTaggart_LettertotheEditor_1978","author":"John Taggart","shortTitle":"Letter to the Editor","title":"John Taggart | Letter to the Editor | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn2\/pictures\/015.html","text":"\n\n\n\n\n\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR\n\n\n....

Clark\u2019s A Still\nLife is dedicated to Lorine Niedecker who, in her use of natural objects\nand extreme formal concision, would seem to be Clark\u2019s chosen model.\nAnd like the lady\u2019s poems, these tend to be brief, understated or be-\nmused in tone, and fairly complexly concerned with natural objects,\nparticularly with a wide variety of flowers. Where they differ is\nspecific gravity. A Niedecker poem can have all those properties and\nconsiderable power at the same time. The power derives from her \"greet-\ning of the spirit.\" Her objects exist in a charged space that is the\nresult of intense, brooded, deliberate investment of herself in them.\nClark, however, is very little present in this book. Thus his objects\nrarely attain more than the condition of still life. They are made\nto undergo composition, but not displacement; they remain small. Many\nof these poems are pleasant and attentive care to the objects and to\n\n\nlanguage is evident throughout. But more is required.

With characteristic efficiency,\n  this programme has been carried out for the most part inadvertently,\n  through the coordinated operation of unconscious forces. According to\n  the newest metaphysics, accident overrules essence and therefore ulti-\n  mately prevails. And the events that surround the death of M. Barthes,\n  recently dispensed to the public with the discreet excitement of snap-\n  shots produced at the critical moment by the prosecution, would have us\n  sadly concur were it not for the subject\u2019s own voice urging us to look\n  into the underlying facts, whose seemingly unambiguous constellation\n  assaults our capacity for judgment. It would indeed be sad if the myth\n  could so easily and so quickly erase the small island on which the\n  mythologist had taken refuge.\n\n   It is for this reason that survival, while a necessity, is not enough\n  with which to combat a feeling of futility in the face of an increasingly\n  unnatural world. If, by chance, there still exist trees unsacrificed to\n  the super-hero comic-book, or if industrial poisons have failed to wipe\n  out every last useless species, this is really of no consequence; for we\n  have come to live too far from nature to notice or care whether there are\n  any accidental survivors of the total exploitation of the world and its\n\n\n   inhabitants. All that is required is that the idea of nature be\n   overcome.\n\n\nTo the modern sensibility conditioned ever more thoroughly by an urbanity\nthat is almost completely manufactured (however hastily or shoddily) and\nartificial in every respect, to a member of an eikosphere so dense with\nmessages and with pseudo-messages that nothing can safely be ignored or\nassumed to be naturally silent and innocent of intent, in a world in\nwhich everything strives to act unilaterally upon everything else with\nthe relentlessness of gravitation, nothing could be felt to be more un-\nnatural than the unsoliciting experience of what in another culture might\nbe authentically called forth as nature.\n\nIn the oldest (and probably unspoken) metaphysics, transparently simple,\nnature was conceived as the partially invisible source of what visibly\nshines forth, and as such embraced within it events that convention alone\nwould be prompted to call unnatural. Only if there were any impossiblity\nat all could there be a genuinely unnatural thing.\n\nThe plasticity of thought, however, is itself a fact often lost to sight,\nand the surface of experience curiously frozen over. The very ubiquity\nof the plastic disguises and alibis the ultimate exhaustibility of the\ncreated world. Unlike true nature which unfolds continuously and not\nalways to our liking or in a way attuned to our conditioning, the entire-\nly determined world is brittle, its material unresponsive or erratic\nbeyond the point to which it has been deliberately thought out. As with\ntheater scenery, the illusion can only be sustained within certain\nbounds; a glimpse of the ropes and canvas patching, and the illusion is\ndestroyed or at least compromised.\n\nGod, with an infinite resource, could conceivably create and sustain\nnature. But a man, judging from human history, granted the exercise of\nhis freedom, would either set out like Kafka\u2019s cage that \"went in search\nof a bird\" or else, sensing the possiblity of another direction along\nwhich thought might agreeably pass, produce and exhibit, like the late\nM. Barthes, renderings of the zoological gardens we have inherited.\n\nJOSEPH TIMKO\n"},{"uid":"AllanTinker_RobertGrenier_1980","author":"Allan Tinker","shortTitle":"Robert Grenier","title":"Allan Tinker | Robert Grenier | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn13\/pictures\/015.html","text":"\n          GRENIER\u2019S BOOK DOESN\u2019T\n\n\n\n\n           like simile\n\n\n\n\n                            MAYBELLINE EYE\n\n\n                             lining\n\n\n                             pencil\n\n\nm-e-t a p-h-y-s-i-q-u-e\n\n\nALLAN TINKER"},{"uid":"MichaelFrederickTolson_LettertotheEditor_1978","author":"Michael Frederick Tolson","shortTitle":"Letter to the Editor","title":"Michael Frederick Tolson | Letter to the Editor | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn4\/pictures\/010.html","text":"\n\n\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR\n\nIf\n\n(f) g\n..................................................................&\/or th\n\n(f) (f)v(f)n root of a - # &\/or (32 &\/or 66) &\/or wh(f)n &\/or............\n\n\n2 bruc(f) andr(f)ws & th(f) r(f)ad(f)rs of l=a=n=g=u=a=g=(f),\n1st r(f)action as r(f)spons(f) 2 r(f)vi(f)w of\nbook unlab(f)1(f)d, unnam(f)d, 2.\n\nth(f) book X m(f)\n\nth(f) r(f) f (f) r(f)nt 4 which consists of\n\nth(f) non-mat (f)rializ(f)d punch-outs\n\nfrom a transpar(f)nt l(f)tt(f)r\/what(f)v(f)r st(f)ncil.\n(65print(f)d surfac(f)s, $3 (n(f)gotiabl(f)).\n\nmad sci(f)ntist\/dcompos(f)r\/sound-think(f)r\/thought-coll(f)ctor\nmanif(f)sting\/xpr(f)ssing via writing\n(occasionally).\n\nl(f)ss tradition than r(f)occurr(f)nc(f).\n\ncar(f)fully consid(f)r(f)d manif(f)station of\n\nawar(f)n(f)ss of\n\nanything is anything,\n\ntim(f)\n\n(consid(f)r substitution),\n\ns(f)lf, spac(f), humor, #, & r(f)ad(f)r\/writ (f) r relationship,\nat l(f)ast,\ncr(f)at(f)s obliqu(f), subtl(f) , & v(f)ry pr(f)s(f)nt structuring\n(sparing &\/or poking ribs).\n\nr(f)j(f)ction of\n\nt(f)chnical at xp(f)ns(f) of psychical,\nr(f)fin(f)d at xp(f)ns(f) of raw.\n\nqu(f)stion ur conc(f)ption of what is intrinsic in languag(f).\nabolitionism of word also non-occurring in ur r(f)vi(f)w.\n\nur quot(f)s, paraphrasing, & articl(f) in g(f)n(f)ral\nr(f)v(f)al substantial non-obs(f)rvation of\n\nm(f)ntionCf)d structuring,\n\n\nmuch significane(f) & vari(f)ty,\n\n& som(f) non-dnotational implications\n\n((f)g non-intro grid)\n\n(not quot(f)d 2 avoid loss du(f) 2 cont(f)xtual displac(f)m(f)nt\nbut,\nur critiqu(f) of c(f)rtain abs(f)nc(f) of control,\n(f)sp(f)cially of th(f) non-r(f)f(f)r(f)ntial implications\nas accurat(f), dsirabl(f), & appr(f)ciat(f)d.\n\n(although, consid(f)r ur, & oth(f)rs\u2019, succ(f)ss in that ar(f)a\n2 b satisfactory 2 m(f)\n\n(&, th(f)r(f)for(f), not as int(f)r(f)sting 2 xplor(f))).\n\n(m curr(f)ntly mor(f) int (f) r(f) st (f) d in\ndtaching languag(f) from physicality\n(i (f) (f) g sound, writing)\nin incr(f)asingly autistic\n(from artist 2 autist)\n\nway\n\nnon-us(f) of languag(f),\n\n& sound thinking\n\n(as n(f)ith(f)r sound nor sil(f)nc(f)) ,\nat l(f)ast.\n\nn(f)v(f)rth(f)l(f)ss, m dlight(f)d as r(f)spons(f) 2 xist(f)nc(f) of\nr(f) vi(f)w.\n\n                                           MICHAEL FREDERICK TOLSON\n\n"},{"uid":"DavidTrotter_VoicesOffMenghamandWilkinson_1980","author":"David Trotter","shortTitle":"Voices-Off: Mengham and Wilkinson","title":"David Trotter | Voices-Off: Mengham and Wilkinson | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1980","date":1980,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":3.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn12\/pictures\/039.html","text":"\nVOICES-OFF: MENGHAM and WILKINSON\n\n(The following is excerpted from David Trotter 's article on Rod Mengham\nand John Wilkinson in Twisted Wrist 4, 4 Bower Street, Maidstone, Kent,\nEngland. Works of Wilkinson and Trotter are available from Infernal\nMethods, c\/o Trotter, Department of English, University College, Gower\nStreet, London.)\n\n  ...I want here to contrast the projects undertaken by Mengham and\nWilkinson with a continental mode which long since turned its back on\nthe unadventurous preoccupations of our own orthodoxies. Poets such as\n\n\n   Paul Celan and Edmond Jabes have developed a mode of writing which one\n   might term \u2019dialectical lyric\u2019, a mode introduced to this country by\n   Anthony Barnett in Blood Flow (1975) and Fear and Misadventure (1977).\n   The first movement of dialectic is negation; a thesis generates its own\n   antithesis and thus negates itself. Sartre argued that all knowledge\n   is dialectical to the extent that the person who knows, knows that he\n   is not the object of his knowledge; the subject discovers the world as\n   his antithesis and himself as a lack (as negativity). Dialectical lyric\n   stages the drama of the \u2019advertising mind\u2019, in Shelley\u2019s phrase, the\n   mind turned toward a \u2019vastness\u2019 which reveals it to itself as a lack:\n   disenfranchised, internally riven. Its characteristic form might be\n   described as a militant slightness:\n\n              The small verse\n              breaches\n              because of the enclosure,\n              but, not the sense.       (Barnett, Fear and Misadventure p.34)\n\n   Every word uttered by the lyric voice sets a limit, announces the ina-\n   bility of that voice to say all there is to say; it is this limit which\n   resonates, giving full \u2019sense\u2019 to insufficiency. The lyric voice, dia-\n   lectically opposed to the unsayable, discovers itself as a lack....\n\n        The texts of Mengham and Wilkinson, on the other hand, are not\n   predicated upon any such absenting movement (the generation of anti-\n   thesis out of thesis) but rather upon the multiple infliction of one\n   thesis on another, different thesis. Indeed, the difference between\n   theses can no longer be regarded as an alienation, and then healed or\n   suppressed by an act of inclusion (Reason, Hegel said, is mind which\n   knows itself to be all reality); rather, it must be affirmed. Silences\n   occur, but only as they are produced by the operation of one thesis on\n   another; not as motive-forces. We have entered a Nietzschean world\n   where forces don\u2019t enter into relation with opposites they themselves\n   have generated, but with other forces.... In the cognitive realm, there\n   \u2019is only a perspective seeing, only a perspective \"knowing\"; and the more\n   affects we allow to speak about one thing, the more eyes, different eyes,\n   we can use to observe one thing, the more complete will our \"concept\" of\n   this thing, our \"objectivity\", be. But to eliminate the will altogether,\n   to suspend each and every affect, supposing we were capable of this\u2014\n   what would that mean but to castrate the intellect?\u2019 (Genealogy of\n   Morals). The merit of Mengham and Wilkinson is that they allow more\n   affects to speak, more eyes to observe, and so declare our boredom with\n   the castrated text presented by the weaker versions of the dialectical\n   lyric, the text whose entire business is not to deliver.\n\n        The effacing of origins in modern literary theory and practice (in-\n   cluding dialectical lyric) has forbidden us to ask the Nietzschean ques-\n   tion Who is speaking here? Traditional lyric forms, on the other hand,\n\n\n   have raised the question in order to answer it without delay, to erase\n   a potentially troublesome uncertainty. The work of Mengham and Wilkinson\n   has restored the question as a question : neither preempted nor resolved.\n   Curiosity as to who is speaking in these texts seems to me central to\n   the pleasure we take in them. There is for example an occasional well-\n   spokenness in Wilkinson\u2019s writing, a sumptuous intonation, a provocative\n   snobbism which might either be residual or the revenge taken by the\n   demotic text on itself; which must be read as the operation of one\n   \u2019will\u2019 on another. Having unsqueamishly lifted the stone of totemic\n   Absence, both Wilkinson and Mengham seem to gaze at the life beneath\n   with a sometime paranoid inscrutability; but we are no longer dealing\n   with the reserve of miniature and can hardly ignore the questions they\n   pose.\n\n\nDAVID TROTTER\n\n\n\n            *\n\n\nI can\u2019t predict my accents. Sweeping up the short vowel, it is bor-\nrowed from his cool page. Any phrase, it dives out, you\u2019ll try to\ndivine it in our best light.

The fact that man, or, as Heidegger says, the 'there-being' has\nalready-always, in so far as he exists, a world, does not in fact mean that he is in an actual relation\nwith all things but only that he is familiar with a system of signs and of meanings; that is to say he\nalieady-always owns a language. Being, for things, means, according to this perspective, belonging to\na totality of references which is given first of all as a system of meanings.\n\n        The only novelty is that every humanistic perspective \u2014 if indeed there ever was one \u2014 is\nabandoned: if man is a 'thrown-project' (geworfener Entwurf), Heidegger writes in Brief, the one who\nthrows in the project is Being and not man. Furthermore, the relation between there-being and\nlanguage, with its typical structure of reciprocal dependence (we speak language but it is language\nwhich dominates us in so far as it conditions and delimits our possibilities of experience), is the\n\u2018place\u2019 where the relation of man and being, also characterized by a reciprocal dependence, is\ngathered. Being is not anything else but its giving itself in language; or, in other words, Being is nothing\nbut the occurrence of language. The event of Being and of language is only one.\n\n\n\n  Translated by Daniel Scanlon\n\n\nWe must be able to indicate the inaugural events which break up the continuity of the actual world\nand establish a new continuity, or a new world. These inaugural events are events of language and\ntheir home is poetry. In this theorization of the ontological range of poetic language, Heidegger\nprovides the premise according to which poetry may be freed from the slavery of referent, from its\nsubjection to the purely representative concept of sign which has dominated the representational\nattitude of metaphysics. Because of the assumption of the language-reality relation as a\nrepresentational relation, traditional aesthetics has always had the problem of specifically qualifying\npoetic language either in terms of certain kinds of content (for example the emotions) or of certain\npurely formal characteristics (verse). Twentieth century poetics has definitively destroyed these\nperspectives; if it has rarely explicitly assumed the ontological position of Heidegger, it has\nnevertheless adopted a perspective which denies the representational dependence of language in\nrelation to things.\n\n         Contemporary thought, with the exception of Gadamer, has interpreted Heidegger's\nidentification of Being and language as if it were the affirmation of an insuperable absence of Being\nwhich can give itself only in the form of a trace. Absence and trace can be affirmed either with a deep\nnostalgia for presence, as it occurs in Derrida and Lacan, or from the point of view of a liberation of\nthe simulacrum from every reference and from every kind of nostalgia for the origin (as in Deleuze).\nHowever, in both cases, the thesis of the 'identity' of Being and language is interpreted as the\ndestruction of every possibility of referring to an 'originary'; experience moves only on the surfaces,\neither lamenting the origin and considering itself fallen and alienated (Lacan, Derrida) or else\nenjoying the freedom which, in such a way, it is given: this would be Deleuze's frenzy of the\nsimulacrum.\n\n         Being must in some way give itself, must be accessible even if that does not mean that it gives\nitself as a presence. The manner in which thought can approach Being, thought not of itself as an\nentity but as that which lets beings be is the An-denken (re-collection). One can also call the An-\ndenken a critical or utopian thought; this associates Heidegger with contemporary philosophical\ntrends which affirm the critical capacity of thought and which describe the negativity of the present\nsituation of man in terms of the loss of all capacity of referring to instances which are alternative to\nthe present order of beings: the lack of this capacity is what Heidegger calls Seinsvergossen heit, the\nforgetlessness of being. But the critical capacity of thought requires a possible way of access to the\noriginary. This possibility is the relation of thought to silence. Silence functions in respect to\nlanguage like death in respect to existence.\n\n         The foundation produced by poetry, which establishes world as the articulation of the\ndimensions of experience in language takes place at the cost of an unfoundation which the poet\nexperiences and which gives his poetry its inaugural power. Only insofar as he opens himself up to\nthe checkmate of the Ab-grund, to the abyss of Chaos and Silence, the poet opens and establishes the\n\n\norder of meanings which constitutes the world. Contemporary poetry has often tried to be rid of this\nromantic and existential conception of poetic activity, retreating into a position which considers\npoetic language as a means by which the human subject reappropriates language passing beyond\ndispersion and alienation of everyday life: This for example is the sense of the formalist categories of\nautoreflexivity and ambiguity. The inaugural meaning of poetry has been carried back in this way to\nthe more acceptable characteristic of being a kind of 'gymnastic of language', which shows in a kind\nof abstract purity the mechanism and hidden possibilities of language, preparing also a better and\nmore conscious use of it on the part of the speakers. But from Heidegger's point of view one cannot\nput in motion the inaugural and establishing function of poetic language, and therefore its function\nof reappropriation of language, without exposing oneself at the same time to the encounter with\nnothingness and silence. On the basis of the connection between lived temporality and Being-unto-\ndeath, nothingness and silence are not to be thought of as a sort of divinity conceived in terms of\nnegative theology but as that which is different from culture, that is to say, nature, animality,\nwildness or in other words body and affectivity previous to and preceding every alienating regulation\nproduced by the 'symbolic' in the Lacanian sense. These are the \u2018contents' of poetic silence.\n\n         Poetry could be defined, from the point of view of Heidegger, as the sunset of language: not\nthe restoration of a condition in which language no longer exists, but the continuous and constantly\nrenewed thrust of language to its own extreme limits, where it becomes marooned in silence. Poetry\ncan be understood as the sunset of language in so far as it is a suspension of the cogency of Lacan's\n'symbolic' in a game of disidentification that in practice negates the 'alienating' character of the\nimaginary, and attributes as positive to art, and to poetry in particular, all those subversive\ncharacteristics which Plato wanted to exorcize, banishing poets from his republic.\n\n         Perhaps the 'reduction' of poetry is not another fact of impoverishment or of loss, to be\nconnected to all the phenomena of the violation of man by a society that is increasingly alienated and\nterroristic. This reduction probably delineates, on the contrary, a utopia in which language and\nmodern subjectivity are eclipsed.\n"},{"uid":"KeithWaldrop_Albiach_1978","author":"Keith Waldrop","shortTitle":"Albiach","title":"Keith Waldrop | Albiach | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn3\/pictures\/009.html","text":"\n        ALBIACH\n\nAnne-Marie Albiach, Etat (1971; Mercure de France, Paris; 124 pages,\n21 francs)\n\n     French poetry was overwhelmed by Surrealism and the last years have\nseen many attempts, not simply to write non-surrealistic poems, but to\nstart out in new directions.

A double\nset of metaphors forms the backbone (\"you\" : crowd line : open space\nutterance : code), but is nowhere developed or stated. The metaphors\nare pushed out of the texture into the background, they become \"struc-\ntural metaphors.\" Thus the texture became free to explore sequence\nproblems, mostly the pivotal line which is both the object of a sentence\nand the subject of the next:\n\n                              I want to stay and look at\n                              the mess I\u2019ve made\n                              spills over\n\n\nThis makes for a very fast flow and at the same time for discontinuity\n(the clash with the grammatical expectation)\u2014which embodies the main\ntheme: that language is \"given\" and yet there is a gap from one word\nto the next.\n\n      The Road Is Everywhere or Stop This Body contains the pivotal\nsyntax with a larger framework (all the circulation systems, including\ntraffic and money). But the limitation of the pivotal line is that it\nallows no syntactical complexity. It\u2019s all speed.\n\n      The newer work {When They Have Senses; Streets Enough To Welcome\nSnow) gives up the fast flow and concentrates on discontinuity, both\nsemantic and syntactical. The method I\u2019ve most worked with is reduced\nchoice, i.e. using a \"given\" vocabulary or \"given\" structure.

The piece evolves in a triangular form,\nstarting from the apex in the first poem \"I\u2019m a story,\u201d and widening in\nthe second \"I\u2019m a story of someone.\" and still wider in the third\n\"Someone whom I\u2019m a story of is the story I am, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s a\nstory.\" This inversion and rearrangement of words in a given line is a\ncommon form in all three poems, leading to a density of language through\nregenerative repetition. The effect of these and other structural devices\nis to give the poem a definite worldly presence of its own, a concern\nwhich appears throughout all Heissenbuttel\u2019s work.\n\n\nAs the title suggests, Schematic Definition of Tradition is an attempt to\narrive at a fixed systemization of terms by which a given phenomenon can\nbe measured. It is easy to see the influence of Stein and Wittgenstein\nin the way Heissenbuttel has limited his field to the appearance of a\nlanguage game. Yet he has gone beyond the ideas of these two catalytic\nfigures to create an extraordinarily compressed work concerned with the\ndifficulty of fixed logic in a perceptual system ridden with contingencies.\nThe entire poem is an attempt to overcome its own spiralling momentum\ntoward the fixity of definition. For example: \u2019\u2019even when they had been\nthere there had already been more of those who hadn\u2019t been there than of\nthose who had been there as long as any who had been there could remember\nthere had been less of those who had been there than of those who hadn\u2019t.\u201d\nA certain futility is implied here and a certain disenchantment with the\nlanguage as a vehicle for getting anywhere is evident.\n\nThe Dilemma of Being High and Dry is the most playful of the three\npamphlets, and Heissenbuttel seems a master of play in writing. A prose\npoem in five stanzas, this piece is more referential in its use of images\nand its superficial appearance as a character description, though again\nthe essential experience lies in the composition and language. The entire\npoem is an improvisation on the aphorism \u2019\u2019high and dry,\u201d with the sense\nof an exquisite elliptical curve, turning simultaneously into itself and\nyet constantly expanding. The work finds its success in the establishment\nof a surface tension between referential words (nouns) and contextual\nwords (prepositions, articles, conjunctions) which interact in a syntax\nthat clarifies itself through contiguity, without ever defining itself\ncompletely.\n\nA key to Dilemma, and perhaps all these poems lies in the end of the\nfourth stanza: \u201d....how it has happened to him and others too namely to\nlive in a world that you don\u2019t see as it is but through who knows what\nimaginings\u201d. By ritualizing the use of contextual language, with or\nwithout referents, he creates a poetry on the plane of presence,\nstructure and event, an exceptional accomplishment.\n\nCRAIG WATSON\n"},{"uid":"CraigWatson_Statement_1978","author":"Craig Watson","shortTitle":"Statement","title":"Craig Watson | Statement | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn6\/pictures\/016.html","text":"\nSTATEMENT\n\nOver the past three years I have found myself preoccupied with two\nformal issues of poetics, intention and addresswhich seem to be\ncentral to a primary question of my need to create poems. Though I\nterm these issues formal, implying an objective investigation, the\nmaking of poetry (in fact the reading of it) has become a very self-\noriented experience. More than saying I engage in the process of\nwriting for myself> it seems I have worked toward a ritualization of\nthe act to the point where it functions in a very specific domain.\nWriting is now for me a means of modulating and organizing phenomenal\nand circumstantial information from all points of experience, a process\nI refer to as \u2019tuning\u2019 myself. As I grow older and seemingly remove\nmyself from unity with any singular, or even plural, socio-cultural\nenvironment, I seem more \u2019on my own\u2019 in a vast environment of interna-\nlized experience. My approach to poetics has become the search for\nresponses and behavioral modes relative to this experience, to surviving\nit as well as conditioning myself to it. Constantly the effort seems\nto be away from any formalization of ideas or structure or definitive\nprocess and towards a rejuvenating line of \u2019basics\u2019, that mythical\npoint where each process is fresh and new and wholly responsive to\nindigenous conditions.\n\n\nI came into the field of alternative forms and \u2019language-oriented\nwriting\u2019 through a process of invention and then, taken with the ideas\nas well as the camaraderie of others similarly set adrift, found myself\nprocessing through an increasingly narrow channel of thought. By\nchoosing to work solely within the perimeters of these somewhat tech-\nnical issues I entered an environment controlled more by theory and\nimposed regulations than one open to all the motivations of a self\noriented process. These imposed constraints became antithetical to the\nidea of poetics as opening, the field becoming increasingly closed by\ncriteria and philosophy. This is surely a phenomena which has plagued\nother artists in other times.\n\nAn awakening to these dissatisfactory conditions several years ago led\nme to the formation of questions concerning address, to whom or to what\nis the writing process oriented, and intention, for what reasons does\nit occur and what function does it potentially serve.

A production number\u2014500 index\ncards, one poem per card. Intended to be read in any order (ideally all\nat once, as on a wall), it denies book format, in which binding would\ngive only one of all possible readings page-by-page. Any sequence is a\nchance ordering, deprogramming mental glue. The words rise off the page\nas the mind would like\u2014well-lit, pure, detached\u2014\"in eternity.\u201d The\nheavy, white paper (field) sets off the IBM Selectric type (thing) as\nutter contrast to dismantle the apparatus of conveyance and release the\nword and its effect. Yet the work is physically awkward, a mechanical\nproblem, and calls attention to itself as visual format. So the object\n\n\n(box) is a complex pun, a narrative grotesque fixing time in ironic ter-\nmination of desire, as much of the actual writing puns. The blue Chinese\ncloth box with ivory clasps might hold the murder weapon or a biological\nanomaly, while the heavy white paper exists in opposition to physicality\nitself. The box is both fetish and transparency, and is identical to the\nwork inside.\n\n     SENTENCES is a distillation of six years\u2019 close attention to \u2019\u2019every-\nthing going on all the time.\u201d Out of voices heard, bird calls, shape of\nlandscape, bolt from the blue, Kerouac\u2019s \u2019\u2019void bowl slant,\u201d some shift\nmakes for denotative signal, as bird pistols brain with peculiar stop to\nall sound. One class of perception in the taxonomy of this work then\nshows parallels of language to outside. \"walking down Washington Avenue\"\nshifts syntactic center as one walking is not all there but in walking.\nIf \"walking\" were enough, why \"down\" to complete it\u2014much less \"Washing-\nton Avenue\" changes scale entirely (arrives). In many cases though the\nshift is in the panorama implied by the words, rather than word meeting\npanorama head-on and equalling it. \"being downstairs\/\/like being awake\"\nis a moment of truth, but not in different use of \"being.\" Each line\nmakes a diminished narrative set, through memory (lines hardening). The\nshift specifies a synaesthetic moment in language shape. Landscape leads\nthrough memory to words (nature as creator), but it is not landscape which\nfollows (nature as created not the same). The composite world picture is\nat the mercy of the word. Revelation is a stylistic conceit. Further-\nmore, the mind knows this (syntax thinking).\n\n     Voice invested with power to make real (symbolism) is finally under-\nmined. Any person\u2019s voice noted shows desire as wish\/bend to unyielding\nother. Cued by dissonance under scrutiny of arbitrary white, the sum\ntotal of the cards exposes the point where structure collapses into words.\nNot the work objectified (as a \"point of rest\") but language brought to\nlight through the failure of object (a \"point of unrest\").

Originally heard in exterior \"materials\"\n(crudely), the interruption of phenomena by the act of writing forces\nwords into actual units of recognition. The question is not assumed,\n\"saids\u201d might be one word or many. \"close close\" is a language equivalent\nto Wittgenstein\u2019s cube. \"it\u2019s you\" extends the moment into any dialogue,\n\"transference isolates\" acts as a romantic landscape, greater than any\nman. \"searchlight distributes sky light it administers\" might be move-\nment or tautology, depending on the resolution inherent in the phrase. A\nvocabulary of possible experience builds from simple counting, as these\n\u2019\u2019units\u201d enumerate any notation.

What I found lacking there was a politics which might\nstart from the structuring to be found in the writing itself. Rather I saw a tendency to simply equate\nvalues in writing, as they might bear on a political analysis, or even as they might originate in a\npolitical response, with the political task taken in its most real sense, with politics. The test of a\n'politics of poetry' is in the entry of poetry into the world in a political way. The means for this entry\nare not to be found in the identity of politics with a style, where A = B, but in a self-conscious\nmethod, and the greatest example of such method to date is Surrealism. Though we theoretically\nknow more about the social reality of language, Les Vases Communicants and the 'Manifesto for an\nIndependent Revolutionary Art' are touchstones to which we will have to refer in the articulation of\npolitical values stemming from the total reformulation of style. The discussion of the political stance\nof Breton here owes a debt to Franklin Rosemont's editing of What Is Surrealism? (London: Pluto\nPress, 1978). Material has also been quoted from Richard Seaver and Helen R. Lane's translation of\nManifestoes of Surrealism (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1969). In this discussion,\nSurrealism stands as an example of method. Inferences, for method in the present and for the 'self' in\nart, follow in the complete version of the talk; for the moment I am interested in placing this\ndiscussion of Surrealist method within the context of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.)\n\nWhat is the difference between method and technique? One could say that technique is the principle\nof construction in the writing. In other words, how the writing is written. And method is the\nprinciple of construction which begins with the activity of the writer as a whole, the extension of the\nact of writing into the world and eventually into historical self-consciousness. Style might be the\nmiddle term. At the origin of method, technique is predictive; that is, it is capable of producing new\nmeaning, out of a stockpile of resources into a future, possible world.\n\n        Wanting to get beyond the identity of the individual writer with his method, I have been\ngoing back to the modem movement in a self-conscious way. Shklovsky generalized this when he\nwrote, approximately: 'One always goes back to one's grandparents.' An American definition of\nmodernism can be found in this quote from Williams' Rome, published in The Iowa Review:\n\nThe modernist is he who sees through to the modern \u2014 to an essential and continuous organization that exists in it,\nperfectly so that to him there is no confusion, no necessity to go back, or to look ahead \u2014 he gets his pleasure here, now.\n\n\nHis work is made of the modern whatever bit he chooses ... but it will be all modern always \u2014 the success is the joy of self\npossession and a perfect present use of material \u2014 through the seemingly apparent brokenness of the life about him.\n\nThe structure within the 'apparent brokenness' is perpetually valid, will always be there. And one of\nthe problems worked out in the modem period was that of the writer's professional role. Apart from\nWilliams, three areas of the modern period bear especially on this: Russian Formalism; the work of\nZukofsky, a one-man movement; and Surrealism. All three involve a negotiation with Marxism in the\narticulation of their fates. The Surrealists called themselves, in fact, 'specialists in revolt'; perhaps the\nemphasis here is on \u2018specialists' rather than on 'revolt.\u2019 \u2018The petit bourgeoisie has no class interest of\nits own.' These members of the middle class arrived at a professional necessity out of the conflict\nbetween bourgeoisie and working class. The working class appears in their work in different forms: as\nworking-class politics, in the case of Breton; working-class aspirations, in the case of Zukofsky; and as\na working-class state, in the case of the Formalists.\n\n         In describing the writer as a locus of conflict tending toward professional necessity, one\ncould begin with 'the self' in these different areas of work. In Zukofsky, the self is corrected to begin\nwith. There was an immediate need to fit a 'non-canonized' individual into the dominant literature\nas perceived. Zukofsky's poetics are the poetics of assimilation; finally the private life, in fact\nsuburban, is the result. After a thorough epistemological effort, the poem stands as a thing outside, a\nmusical whole. 'The words are my life' is the result of a conflict so great that the words become the\nself of the writer and argue for him.\n\n         The Formalist analysis is not so easily reduced. Starting from the separation of signifier and\nsignified in Saussure, they identified poetic language with the dissociative techniques of the Russian\nFuturists. This separation ultimately tended toward the idea of design in language presentation. The\ndirection is outer, toward the person, or many persons, hearing the work. The self is seen\nmechanistically as the amplifier or conductor of language which exists outside. The self might be the\nsign of action, as ill the literary metaphor of Mayakovsky; the 'I' is a constructive device. Behind this\nis the image of Lenin, the type of the intellectual hero in the 20s and 30s.\n\n         One could make an interesting comparison between the images of Lenin to be found in\nZukofsky, in the writings of the Formalists, and in Surrealism. In Zukofsky's poem in 'Memory of\nV.I. Ulianov,' Lenin appears as a star, a point of guidance over generalized flux. Lenin is interpreted\nas an idea here, and as a point of reference intrinsic to method. This was taken literally in Russian\nFormalism; Lenin's language 'as such' was studied in an issue of Lef. A connection was attempted\nbetween the constructive potential of that language and that of poetic language itself. Here we have\nthe mental hero altering the world through the agency of style. The stylistic implications are for\ndirectness, design, and social address.\n\n\n         The Lenin of Surrealism appears in a more moral frame. Lenin would be the guiding light\nfor the party model of the collective act. This sense of the keeper of the flame translates into the\nSurrealist idea of the self. Breton's political conversion came only after reading Trotsky's biography of\nLenin, which he praised for its 'purity of tone.' In the 30s this self became the privileged term and\nlocus for the revolutionary act. The political argument, then, connects the original hero image to the\nidea of tendency in aesthetics itself.\n\n         Surrealism was above all a defense of the self and its value in art. And likewise Surrealism is\nthe movement involving method par excellence. While the method was continually being worked out,\nit never rested in a fixed social role. The Surrealists were addressing a great instability in similar\nterms. When conditions changed, the moment of efficacy of 'the self' disappeared, and the content of\nSurrealist method was irrevocably changed.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn a 1934 talk called 'What is Surrealism?' Breton makes a claim of identity between his movement\nand the social conditions, 'the coming and immediate results of the war of 1870,' which produced\nRimbaud and Lautr\u00e9amont. The poetic response to World War I is tied to the specific political\nprogram known as defeatism:\n\nNothing was to our minds worth saving, unless it was ... \u2018l\u2019amour la poesie\u2019 ... The field was not, to our minds, open to\nanything but a revolution truly extended into all domains, improbably radical, to the highest degree impractical, and\ntragically destroying within itself the whole time the feeling that it brought with it of desirability and of absurdity.\n\nI must, however, insist on this attitude of ours, common to particular men and manifesting itself at periods nearly half a\ncentury distant from each other. .. From the beginning, the Surrealist attitude has had that in common with Lautr\u00e9amont\nand Rimbaud which once and for all binds our lot to theirs, and that is wartime defeatism.\n\nSo the legitimacy of self-contradiction, however precious, in historical terms, led to a self-conscious\nmethod equal to the 'desirability and absurdity' of a response to the war. Breton is consciously\nidentifying that personal response with the call for defeatism and proletarian internationalism made\nby the party of Lenin. Defeatism, then, was a program followed by certain socialist parties during the\nwar which refused support for the bourgeois states in which they happened to find themselves. It is\ninteresting to make a comparison between the wartime defeatism of Breton and the response to the\nVietnam war; defeatism was never articulated as clearly in the United States. Even so, we all know\nwho we wanted to win.\n\n         But Breton's position in 1934 is a later interpretation of an early yearning for method which\nwas not specifically political. The first involvements with method were in a sense extra-literary, or\n'above the level of the writing': the work with mental patients during the war, his first acquaintance\n\n\nwith automatism; the social orchestrations of Apollinaire; and the involvement with Dada as a public\nact. The literary influence of Reverdy's theory of the image, 'the dynamic union of unrelated objects,'\nwhich can be seen in Mont de Piet (1919), met with these forays into method to produce the first\nexperiments with automatic writing, published as The Magnetic Fields with Soupault in 1921.\n\n          The automatic image is introduced this way in the Manifesto of Surrealism (1924):\n\nOne evening, therefore, before I fell asleep, I perceived, so clearly articulated that it was impossible to change a word ... a\nrather strange phrase which came to me without any apparent relation to the events in which ... I was then involved ...:\n'There is a man cut in two by the window...' accompanied as it was by the faint visual image of a man walking cut half way\nup by a window perpendicular to the axis of his body.\n\nBreton's interest in this image is from the point of view of style; it is contrasted to the tidy accounts\nof realist prose, of which this example is given:\n\nThe small room into which the young man was shown was covered with yellow wallpaper: there were geraniums in the\nwindows, which were covered with muslin curtains; the setting sun cast a harsh light over the entire setting ...\n\nSo a point of reference in the first Manifesto is realist prose, a literary form. Although the argument\nhere appears to be primarily toward style (in the widest sense, the quality of an image), Breton\njustifies this style in the name of science, not art. And in general, whenever breton makes a claim of\nauthority for his position, the claim is made in the name of science. He talks about his researches, the\nSurrealist experiment, and so forth. He does not rationalize his efforts in terms of literary history to\nthe same extent. Obviously this is because literature, capital L, is coded into the social structure with\nwhich Breton finds himself at odds. So Surrealism extended itself away from literariness and toward\nexperimental 'results':\n\nOn the basis of these discoveries a current of opinion is finally formed by means of which the human explorer will be able to\ncarry his investigations much farther, authorized as he will henceforth be not to confine himself solely to the most summary\nrealities. The imagination is perhaps on the point of reasserting itself, of reclaiming its right ...\n\n          The appeal to science extends the boundaries of the literary act. Shklovsky described this\nkind of extension as 'the canonization of peripheral forms.' Speaking from the point of view of an art\ngoing through progressive changes in historical time, Shklovsky saw that the movement from one\nperiod to another was abrupt and disruptive. One way that this movement is articulated is through\nan appeal to peripheral forms. That is, at a given point in the decay of one kind of literature, writers\nwould extend literature to an outside source, for example folk tales, which would bring in new\npossibilities for style. So there is a dialectic between 'literariness' and both language and cultural\n'materials' as a whole.\n\n\n         Rather than focus on the constant 'experimental' activity of the Surrealists at that time:\nautomatic writing, s\u00e9ances, fortune telling, and other language games, one can see a method\ndeveloping which is greater than any technique. This method begins with the representation of the\nself, the agency or efficacy of the writer thinking beyond categories, as absolute, expanded beyond\nand unimpeded by previous literary domains.\n\n         The style of Breton's critical writings in the 20s is a perfect example of this presentation of\nself. The writings invariably take off from subject matter, never to return but to arrive at a further\npoint. Criticism, Breton says, is an \u2018act of love\u2019; there is no taking apart or analysis of other oeuvres.\nRather the examples of other artists are predictive, pointing the way to the future of as yet unrealized\nacts. Breton's critical writings exist to give a tremendous boost. This boost is the substance of\nBreton's prose, and its realization in style is in an utter flamboyance of self-presentation.\n\n         The first few essays in What is Surrealism? show how this works. The earliest, \u2018For Dada,\u2019 is a\ntestimony to congruence of spirit:\n\nI speak for the pleasure of compromising myself. Appeals to the questionable modes of discourse should be forbidden ..\nThe obscurity of our utterances is constant . The Dadaists from the start have taken care to state that they want nothing\n. What is myself? Don\u2019t know, don\u2019t know, don\u2019t know .\n\nDada is a state of mind, therefore. The next testimony for Dada shows Breton\u2019s determination to\nthink beyond that state:\n\nThe essence and the formula will perhaps always evade me, but ... it is the search for them that matters, and nothing else.\nHence this great void that we are obliged to create within ourselves ... I do not wish to slip on the floor of sentimentality.\nThere is . no such thing as error, at the most one might speak of a bad bet .\n\nOne can see here the crystallization of purpose out of the host liquid of 'despair'. The self, or single\nartist, is becoming the locus of a collective voice. The examples, then, of other individual artists are\ntaken as stepping-off points. On Duchamp:\n\nLet us be suspicious of all materializations whatsoever ... Is there anything that can do us more harm than a materialization?\n... Let us leave our friends to fight over these grotesque tautologies and return to Marcel Duchamp ... In writing these lines\n... I have not undertaken to exhaust the subject: Marcel Duchamp ... The thing that constitutes the strength of Duchamp is\nhis disdain for the thesis ... It would be a good idea to concentrate on this disdain ...\n\nDuchamp here is the hero of the method without objects. In fact, pure method without regard for what\nis to be produced. Picabia is the hero of the method of many objects, or the inconsistency of style:\n\n\nYou haven't stopped running ... and, whatever distance you think you have put between you and you, you still leave behind\nnew statues of salt. The man who changes most from Picabia is Picabia ... And how would the majority of people perceive\nthat for the first time a painting has become a source of mystery, after having for so long been only a speculation about\nmystery, and that this art has no model, either decorative or symbolic ...\n\nAnd then there's the hero of the method of the reconstituted object, Max Ernst:\n\nUnfortunately, human effort, which never ceases to vary the disposition of existing elements, cannot succeed in producing a\nsingle new element. A landscape into which nothing earthly enters is beyond the reach of our imagination. And it seems\nlikely that we would refuse to evoke it ... We must accept these conventions, and then we can distribute and group them\naccording to whatever plan we please. It is because they failed to understand this essential freedom and its limits that\nsymbolism and futurism failed.\n\n         This idea of language and psyche being a kind of vast reservoir for collage appears later in the\n'image bank' of Burroughs. It bears on the criticism of the 'Zeno's paradox of biomorphism,' or\norganic form. One of the problems with the attack on normative grammar, which would break it\ndown into bits and pieces of verbal rubble which then might release libidinal flux, is that it demands\na prior value, \u2018a whole person in a whole world.\u2019 And since that is not possible, we have to keep\ngoing, back to the original impossible act. For Breton, the elements are fixed; action is possible\nwithin them. There is no final term, as in Symbolism; there is only what is available. From this point\nof view action is predictive, leading to something else rather than back to what was already there.\n\n         Breton implies that the word comes from outside. At this point the position is liberating;\nlater it ends in the doldrums of hermeticism, a position one could easily have no interest in at all.\nNeither is there anything in the Surrealist view of women but a literary romance. What is left to\nconsider is the independence and history of the sign, which Breton refuses to detach from the thing.\nThe adjusted outsider will go down with the ship of 'the intellectual between two wars.' But Breton\nproposes a method above and beyond, without reliance on its objects. There are many possible\ntechniques; Breton refuses static characterization of technique.\n\n         So in 'Letter to Seers' (1925) Breton describes 'techniques' (fortune-telling and arcane faith\nin the medium) which are arbitrary enough but which at the same time open the way for a theory of\nthe imagination, one which comes up again in Robert Smithson's 'Incidents of Mirror Travel in the\nYucatan.' This theory of the imagination leads to Nadja, one of Smithson's greatest influences, which\nhe possibly never read. Again the predictive value of any technique is at the heart of method: the\nability of technique to construct a possible future:\n\nTime is certain. Already the man that I will be has the man that I am by the throat, but the man that I have been leaves me\nin peace. This is called my mystery, but I do not believe in (I do not prize) the impenetrability of this mystery, and no one\nwholly believes in it for himself.\n\n\nEverything that is revealed to me about the future falls in a field which is nothing other than that of absolute possibility, and\ndevelops there at all costs ... It appears that I must go to China around 1931 and run great dangers there for twenty years.\nI have faith in everything you have told me ... for thanks to you I am already there.\n\nOut of hatred for memory, for that combustion that it feeds in all the places where I no longer want to see anything, I want\nto have dealings only with you ... What is will be by virtue of language alone: nothing in the world can stop it. I grant that\nthat may be more or less well stated, but that is all.\n\n         A simultaneous hero in terms of constructing a possible future was Lenin. The early politics\nof the Surrealists were struggles of identity as much as of political tendency. Breton\u2019s career in the\nparty was aborted, but the Surrealists took on the party model from then on. But the tone of hysteria\nin the Second Manifesto is not to be explained only by Breton\u2019s disclaimer, later, that he was unduly\ninfluenced by tendential warfare. Breton took on the Leninist party model and adapted it to an\naesthetic involved in the total disruption of boundaries at the service of egotism, toeing the line of\nHegelian idealism. In other words, he identified the revolution with his own psychic resources and\nintellectual discipline. There was no rest point in exterior social fact for Breton's Marxism; in fact, it\nis only later, when his political stance is secure, that coal strikes, wages, the popular front, etc., can be\nused in support of the Surrealists' position. For example, the social argument of Les Vases\nCommunicants (1932) is that economic structures limit free choice in love. Only after concretizing\nthe problems of identity posed in the Second Manifesto, through Dali's later theory of paranoia-\ncriticism, could he arrive at actual social facts.\n\n         Paranoia might be defined as a delirium of interpretation bearing a systematic structure. And\nparanoia-criticism, as practiced by Dali, is a spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on\nsystematic objectification of delirious associations. The self becomes a projection of any\nphenomenon; the boundaries between self and other are blurred. In Les Vases Communicants Breton\ndiscusses himself as having possibly entered into that state. That state of mind having been achieved,\nand for a number of other factors, the political position hardened somewhat, to terminate in its most\nstable form with the beginning of World War II. But for the period of 1931-39, Breton's\nidentification with social revolution was complete, and a major accomplishment of Surrealist\nmethod.\n\n         By 1934-35, Surrealism's method had assumed a kind of permanent value for the 'redeemed'\nself, ever valid in historical time, especially given revolutionary responsibility. The techniques of\nSurrealism appear to gravitate toward two poles: verbal-auditory, involving automatic writing,\nlyricism, the uninterrupted voice, leading to the possibility of an imagination free from constraints;\nand verbal-visual, involving the representational value of the Surrealist image, poem-objects and objets\ntrouv\u00e9s (found objects, connected with accident, or objective chance), leading to the capacity to\n\n\ninspire the dream in others. This latter function is tied directly to the function of language in\nrecording dreams; the Surrealist object is an idealization of the objectification through words of the\ndream experience, coming from the practice of writing down dreams.\n\nIn Les Vases Communicants Breton argues his way out of a period of delirium of interpretation and\npolitical identity crisis through a close examination of the interpenetration of dream and exterior\nfacts:\n\n\nThe fog exists. Contrary to current opinion, it is formed of the thickness of things immediately sensible when I open my\neyes. These things that I love, how could I also not hate them for derisively hiding all other things from me? It has appeared\nto me, it still appears to me, it is everything this book intends that in examining closely the most irreflective activity, if one\npasses beyond the extraordinary and badly tranquilling effervescence apparent on the surface it is possible to bring to light a\ncapillary tissue in ignorance of which one works in vain to understand mental circulation. The role of this tissue is visibly to\nassure the constant interchange which must take place in thought between exterior and interior worlds, an interchange\nrequiring a continual interpenetration of waking and sleeping activity. My only ambition has been to give an idea of its\nstructure. Whatever the pretensions common to integral consciousness and the delirious details of rigor, it cannot be denied\nthat this tissue covers a sufficiently vast region. It is there that, for man, the permanent transactions of satisfied and\nunsatisfied necessities are consummated, there that the spiritual thirst \u2014 which, indispensably, from birth to death, must be\ncalmed rather than cured \u2014 is exalted.\n\n          The syntax of this writing itself might be the capillary tissue between reality and dream.\nWhat does this mean for method:\n\nWith a little ingenuity it would not be impossible to succeed in provoking certain dreams in another being, if one at least\napplied oneself to making the other fall, in spite of himself, within a remarkable-enough system of coincidences. It would in\nno way be utopian to pretend, by these means, to work seriously upon the other's life, from a distance. The real fact, which\nis a result, would gain in solidity to the extent that one of its principal components might thus, in great measure, be\ndetermined a priori, and given. I should hope this proposal might obtain approval from enough minds that it move towards\npractical application.\n\nSo the science of dreams extends to social control. But this 'social control' could also be understood\nas an exalted description of an art exhibition. This \u2018remarkable enough system of coincidences' could\nbe a collection of paintings. Here is an area where common sense flip-flops with a tremendous\nutopia.\n\n          If this fixed 'system of coincidences' has use, it stems from the value given to unimpeded\nflux, not modified by any intention for control. In 'The Automatic Message' (1933) Breton states a\nprimary value for automatism:\n\n\nThe fundamental disequilibrium of modern civilized man vainly strives to absorb itself in the artificial concern with minor\nand transitory equilibriums. The odious crossing out of words increasingly afflicts the written page, crossing out life itself\nwith a stroke ... To correct, to correct oneself, to polish, to smooth out, to find fault instead of drawing blindly from the\nsubjective treasure ... this is a command which ... slavish custom ... has for centuries asked us to obey.\n\nOne would like to know exactly how much he did correct. But to whatever extent, it was not to give\nvalue to the activity of correction. Instead, Breton sets his sights only on the outcome of the\nautomatic act:\n\nIn a dark room, his eyes wide open, Watt contemplates the future steam engine \u2014 the one to come. What is not yet will be\n... The expression \u2018All is written,\u2019 it seems, must literally be held to. All is written on the blank page ... The beautiful\ninterpretive wall, brimming with lizards, is now but a fence post toppling on the highway, before which a landscape that\nnever has had time to form itself reconstitutes, further, the magic mirror in which life and death may be read ... Let us cast a\nglance ... on these elementary surfaces in which the future world has for so long elected to compose itself. Coffee grounds,\nscrap iron, cloudy mirror: it is of you that the impenetrably bright veils on the hats of young women are made.\n\nAnother famous automatic image is that of Kekule's ring, in which the chemist Kekule's dream of\nfish chasing each other around in a ring predicted the molecular structure of benzene. For Breton,\nthis automatic reading can be accomplished against the most ordinary, indistinct backgrounds: scrap\nheaps or coffee grounds, which brings back the argument to seers and tea leaves.\n\nAll the experimentation here would be of a nature to demonstrate that perception and representation (which to the ordinary\nadult seem radically opposed) are merely products of the dissociation of one original faculty, of which the eidetic image\ngives us an idea and of which one still finds a trace among primitives and children... Systematically... one can work from this\npoint where the distinction between subjective and objective ceases to be necessary or useful.\n\nApart from the false causal idea here, the identity of perception and representation seems to be at the\ncenter of the use found for automatism and the Surrealist object.\n\n          In 'The Surrealist Situation of the Object' (1935), Breton quotes Hegel to rank poetry first\namong the arts because of its 'need to attain, first by its own means and secondly by new means, the\nprecision of sensible forms.' This makes it a paradigm for other arts: 'Painting benefits from the only\nexternal element that no art can get along without, namely inner representation, the image present to\nthe mind ...' Hegel gives a value to the image: 'All idea is image, an internal representation of an act.\nThe representation of the act is thereby the beginning of the action.' Breton's belief in the universal\ninterpretability of this image completes the logic of the revolutionary necessity of the private image in\npoetry. The private image is revolutionary transformation in germ.\n\n\nThus, Hegel also wrote, it is a matter of indifference whether a poetic work be read or recited. Such a work may also be\ntranslated, without essential alteration, in a foreign language and even in prose poems. The relationships between sounds\nmay also be totally changed.\n\nThe image, which is a repressed act, is independent of the grounds on which it is visualized, and can\nbe translated from one material to another. This transparency of the material is close to Surrealist\ntechniques in verse; there is often an extreme linearity of progression and an extreme literalness of\nline. Self-conscious parallelism works for the mechanistic production of image and statement. This is\nan argument against other considerations of technique, such as meter or sound, which the Surrealists\ndid not discuss, and an argument for the convertibility of the image in Hegel's terms. The image\ntravels endlessly; this is the substance of Surrealist internationalism, in fact. The grounds are\narbitrary; it is not French language or literature but the condition of 'man.' Breton's poetics are not\n'language specific,' and this fact allows for an interconvertibility between poetry and the world itself:\n\nThis I for my part believe ... in ... the experiment of incorporating objects ... within a poem, or more exactly of composing a\npoem in which visual elements take their place between the words without ever duplicating them ... The reader-spectator\nmay receive quite a novel sensation, one that is exceptionally disturbing and complex, as a result of the play of words with\nthese elements, nameable or not.\n\nFor this 'reader-spectator' Breton both made poems which contained images of objects, and arranged\nreal objects, with written words, to make 'object poems.' The logical consequence of these techniques\nis the Surrealist object: 'an object which lends itself to a minimum of mechanical functions and is\nbased on phantoms and representations liable to be provoked by the realization of unconscious acts'\n(Dali). Here is a description by Breton of a Surrealist object recovered from sleep, in the\n'Introduction to the Discourse on the Paucity of the Real':\n\nI got my hands on a rather curious book in my sleep, in an open air market out toward Saint-Malo. The spine of this book\nwas formed by a wooden gnome with an Assyrian-style white beard which came down to its feet. The statuette was of\nnormal thickness and yet it in no way interfered with turning the pages of the book, which were made of thick black wool. I\nhastened to acquire it and when I woke up i regretted not finding it near me. It would be relatively easy to re-create it. I\nshould like to put a few objects of this sort in circulation ...\n\nThis object is produced in a dream, though similar objects can be found in real life. One of these is\nNadja, and another is the wooden spoon which led Breton to his second wife in L'Amour Fou,\npredicted in the poem 'Tournesol.' At this point the mysticism is getting unbearable: one wishes to\nconcentrate instead on the objectification of the image and to relate it to the dialectically inspired\nprojections of Robert Smithson. The emphasis on a \u2018new myth,\u2019 after World War II, and the\nincreasing hermeticism of Surrealism, may be taken as symptomatic of a total transformation of the\n\n\nsocial conditions in which Surrealism articulated itself, which transformation Trotsky saw as the\nprobable raison d\u2019etre of the war. In Breton\u2019s myth, we are the small bodies, the cells, of larger\norganisms beyond our ability to sense. It is not very difficult to imagine that these large bodies are the\nmovements of history. And it would not be possible to characterize Breton's position as a host-\nparasite relationship until World War II came along to destroy the basis for the articulation up to\nthat time. The shift was so sudden and total that Breton had to admit to his subjectivity again. In\ndifferent circumstances, this happened also to Zukofsky, who in the postwar period argued out of the\nhistorical necessity of the 30s into the personal locus of his work. So the new value given to\nindividual aesthetics is likewise a recognition of the impossibility of social scale.\n\n"},{"uid":"BarrettWatten_MohawkandKetjak_1978","author":"Barrett Watten","shortTitle":"Mohawk and Ketjak","title":"Barrett Watten | Mohawk and Ketjak | L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E | 1978","date":1978,"isPartOf":"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E","journalVolume":1.0,"database":"eclipsearchive.org","url":"http:\/\/eclipsearchive.org\/projects\/LANGUAGEn4\/pictures\/012.html","text":"\n\n\n            MOHAWK AND KETJAK\n\n\n     An article in the April issue of Scientific American on mathemati-\ncally generated music refers to \u2019\u2019fractal curves,\u201d which show the same\nfluctuating patterns over time for any duration.

The scale telescopes from word-to-word\njumps to page \u2019\u2019flicker noise\u201d to curve of the whole, but the irregularity\nand energy seen in the words is constant. The fixed vocabulary and use\nof the two-dimensional page give the work a flatness and autonomy; the\nwriter is outside the work. Coolidge\u2019s earlier investigation into word-\ngap led to writing which is now mainly intrinsic, thinking along a line,\nwhile Silliman is involved with extrinsic dimensions\u2014landscape, national\nboundaries, demography. The distance he found from the page in Mohawk\nmakes it the first term in a series of works in variable scale, an\nentrance. This distance is close to the clearly imagist quality of the\nwords: \u201dwet\/loom\/star\/wicker\/silt...,\u201d each word a snapshot on the page.\n\n     Ketjak is written in paragraph blocks, each twice the length of the\nprevious. Repeated material makes an infra-skeleton, though sentences\nused more than once take on new values. Given this mechanism, the work\nwas slowly deliberately written over some months. It is a fractal curve\nof an experience which might reduce to \u2019\u2019revolving door.\u201d The work\u2019s step-\nwise progress makes for an evaluative mode of thinking\u2014values of the\nsentences are revealed in how they jive with those around them. Some are\n\n\nsour notes, lost handles, not repeated. Others become familiar landscapes\nof daily life, the noon whistle. The imagist core of Silliman\u2019s sentences\nshows through variation of emphasis. Frozen narratives in series add up\nto what could be read as a completely interior novel. This activity is\n\"an expression of an euphoria.\" Meanwhile the distance from the text\nfleshes out all manner of gossip, theory, fact. \"Then we made a map of\nthe entire country, on exactly the same scale. It was impossible to put\ninto use.\"\n\n     Only someone who had thought intensely about the fate of other\npeoples\u2019 lives could have written Ketjak. This morality is in the dis-\ntance from the text and in the insistence on particular information.\nSilliman allows ideology into his poem along with trivial facts not\nusually accepted as important. So there can be an evaluation, change of\nstate. One is outside, invents a position, insists on what he sees.\nConflict produces the purest types of writing. To imagine another life\nwithout power gives value to the fact. Identity is all that literary\npolitics can produce. Ketjak is a political act, Identity in Silliman\u2019s\nwork is open-ended.\n\nBARRETT WATTEN\n\n\n\n\nSILLIMAN BIBLIOGRAPHY: Crou) (1971; Ithaca House, c\/o Small Press\nDistribution, 1636 Ocean View Ave, Kensington, CA 94707, $1.95).

Since women have been thor-\noughly silenced as a group, the expression of our ideas and experience\nis central to the movement for our liberation. We recognize that not\n\n\nonly have women been silenced as a sex, we have been oppressed\u2014and\nsilenced\u2014on the basis of our race, our class, and our sexuality.\nTherefore, we are particularly concerned that the voices of lesbians,\nworking women and women of color be heard.\n\nWe first organized at San Francisco State University in 1975. Since\nthen we have evolved into a community-based organization.... We believe\nthat art and politics cannot be separated, but that each enriches the\nother. Accordingly, we have been active in a number of struggles, in-\ncluding benefits for the Cassandra Peten Defense Fund and the Wendy\nYoshimura Defense Fund. We have also participated in the Gay Freedom\nDay March and an abortion rights demonstration. We hold forums which\nstress the connection between art and the struggle against racism, sex-\nism and classism.... The Women Writers Union holds a members\u2019 workshop,\ngives readings, and offers classes in writing, open to all women. In\nthe planning stages, are an anthology of our work and a regular series\nof forums...\n\nIn connecting art to politics, the Women Writers Union maintains that a\nmulti-issue approach is necessary, that the struggles are not separate,\nbut are one and the same. We are not separatists: our forums and read-\nings are open to all. We believe in the power of words to persuade, to\neducate and to help unite all of us in our struggle.

We can assume that the producers of the books\nthat have survived used that specific bookform because it had advantages\nlacking in other forms. There is no evidence that the spinebound format\nthe only form we use to a significant extent today, was ever used in\npreconquest Mexico.\n\n     To make a screenfold, the book producer took long, thin strips of\nanimal skin or bark paper and glued them together until he had a strip\nlong enough to make his book. These were often very long\u2014Codex\nVaticanus 3773, for instance, is 735 cm long when completely unfolded.\nHe then scored and folded the skin or bark at regular intervals so that\nit could be folded up, accordian fashion, into a relatively small, por-\ntable bundle. Pages were approximately square. This form has several\nadvantages over the spinebound format. The book can be completely un-\nfolded so that half the book (one side) can be seen at once. There\nneed be no break in continuity between pages throughout either side;\nwith a spinebound book you can not simultaneously look at pages 1 and\n2 because page 2 is on the back of page 1. Perhaps most important,\npages can be juxtaposed so that many different combinations of pages\ncan be seen together. For instance, if you want to look at pages 1 and\n6 at the same time, you can fold pages 2,3,4, and 5 together and leave\n1 and 6 next to each other:\n\n\npages\n\n\npage 1 page 6\n\n\nYou can even fold this type of book in such a way that parts of the\nreverse can be seen at the same time as parts of the obverse.\n\n     The texts painted in these   books were almost pure  ideograms \u2014 in\n\nfact, one Nahuatl word for them   translates as \u2019thought pictures.\u2019 I\n\nwon\u2019t discuss the images themselves here, since I\u2019m simply writing on\nthe basic book format; but it\u2019s   important to note that  this kind of\n\npictorial, rather than linguistic, writing   is the kind  that can benefit\n\nfrom screenfold format in ways that phonetic writing can not. Bear in\n\n\nmind also that these books were not used so much to give the reader new\ninformation as to deepen what he already knew.\n\n     Private Reading: We can be sure that the precolumbian central\nMexicans practised some sort of yoga. Perhaps one of the most impor-\ntant functions of these books was to aid in such a meditative disci-\npline. We can imagine a neophyte memorizing the images of the deities\nin the screenfolds to use in internal visualizations, somewhat as\nTibetan Buddhists do today. This practice may underlie all others, at\nleast for those books of a religious nature.\n\n     A fair number of surviving screenfolds are organized around calen-\ndars. Priests used them to determine when to hold festivals, to deter-\nmine astral influences (particularly those of the planet Venus), and to\ndetermine the names and destinies of the people at the time of their\nbirth (central Mexicans took their birth dates as names \u2014 these names\nand dates embodied an enormous amount of mythic and stellar material).\nThe reader of calendrical screenfolds could juxtapose calendars, holding\nbefore him for comparison a solar and a Venus calendar, or a solar\ncalendar and a list of the Lords of the Night that would pertain to\nthat solar calendar, etc.\n\n     The case is similar with the screenfolds dealing with history.\nThe precolumbian Mexicans saw history as cyclical: using the screen-\nfolds, the student of history could compare similar parts of different\ncycles of time \u2014 say the first year of cycle A with the first year of\ncycle B, folding up the intervening years of cycle A. He could then\nreread the history of the two cycles chronologically with a deeper\nunderstanding of their significance.\n\n     I\u2019ve headed these reading situations \u2019private\u2019 because private\nreading is possible under them. We can\u2019t, however, be positive that\nreaders actually remained silent during them. With the possible excep-\ntion of the student of Mexican yoga, silent reading was probably rare\nif not unknown. We can imagine a priest reciting verses when opening\na book to check a date, continuing his recitation while checking, and\ncontinuing after the book had been closed. The yoga student may well\nhave chanted a mantram while memorizing an image. In any case, these are\nsituations in which a reader could read with no one else near him;\nthe following seem to require more than one participant.\n\n     Public Reading: Most contemporary students of language would class\nthe precolumbian central Mexicans as preliterate \u2014 by which they would\nmean that these people had not developed a phonetic system that could\nrecord specific words in exact and unalterable sentences. The central\nMexicans probably had an oral language art much like that described by\nLord and Parry in THE SINGER OF TALES, in which the poet could sing\nelaborate songs spontaneously according to formulas. The screenfolds\nwere probably used in performances of this type, probably not as mnemon-\nics \u2014 as a number of writers have assumed \u2014 but as a source of inspira-\ntion for the singer and\/or a visual counterpart for his audience. We\n\n\ncan imagine the singer sitting in the middle of an audience arranged in\na semicircle, with the screenfold set up as another semicircle between\nsinger and audience; or again, the singer unfolding his screen as he\nunfolded his story. This would be particularly useful in education and\nperhaps this is one of the reasons why a similar method could be used\nso easily for Christian indoctrination after the conquest.\n\n     We know that on certain special occasions the central Mexicans\nmounted screenfolds, fully extended, around the walls of rooms, so they\nbecame mural strips. They probably were not mere decorations, but texts\nto be meditated on during the special occasions. Such a mounting of\nthe book would allow a number of people to read the same screenfold at\nthe same time. It\u2019s even possible that readers recited poems, prayers,\netc. as they looked at the texts. Perhaps several people recited simul-\ntaneously as they read \u2014 their group performances resembling something\nlike a contemporary performance of, say, Jackson MacLow\u2019s GATHAS.\n\n     Though we know little of the other bookforms current in preconquest\ncentral Mexico, we can assume that they were as well adapted to the\nuses to which they were put as was the screenfold.\n\nKARL YOUNG\n\n"}]
