Stivale and Christian Kerslake\n\nTranslated by Christian Kerslake\n\n \n\nKyril Ryjik: […] in incest in psychoanalysis and in anthropology, there is an aspect of incest that you leave aside, the place of which one does not see in schizo incest. So why the word ‘incest’ in that case?\n\nDeleuze: To state the basic principle, it was a question of seeking what the conditions of statements [énoncés] were in general[1]; and after all, one could pose psychoanalysis under this form: what are the conditions of statements, supposing that statements have relations with desire, that is to say, with the unconscious? Statements are not at all the products of a system of signification; they are the product of machinic assemblages[2], they are the product of collective agents of enunciation. Which implies that there are no individual statements, and that behind statements – when for example one is able to assign some epoch where statements change, a historical epoch where a new type of statement is created, for example the great breaks of the Russian revolution type, or indeed of the phalanx type in the Greek city;[3] a new type of statement appears, and on the horizon of this type of statement there is a machinic assemblage that makes it possible, i.e. a system of political agents of enunciation. ‘Collective’ does not mean ‘people’, nor ‘society’, but something more [phrase missing – ‘like multiplicities’?].[4] We must seek in machinic assemblages that belong to the unconscious the conditions for the emergence of new statements, the bearers of desire, or what concerns desire.\n\nOnce again, it is no longer a question of opposing, like two poles, a pole that we would assign to paranoia, and a pole that we would assign to schizophrenia. On the contrary, it’s about saying that everything, absolutely everything, is part at the same moment of a machinic assemblage which is determinable, and we simply have to see how this assemblage is made insofar as it is productive of statements.\n\nIt seemed to me that every machinic assemblage literally hooked itself onto a certain type of body without organs. The question we are dealing with is: assuming that every machinic assemblage happens, hooks itself onto, mounts itself on a body without organs, how is that fabricated, a body without organs? What can serve this or that person as a body without organs? This is also the drug-user’s problem: how do they make it so that, assuming this is true, this really is a formation of the unconscious, upon which [phrase missing], and that it functions as a condition so that assemblages, connections, are established, so that there is something that one can call a body without organs? Groups are bodies without organs; political groups, community groups, etc., imply species of bodies without organs, sometimes imperceptible, sometimes perceptible, on which the entire machine assemblage that will produce statements will attach itself. The archetype of the body without organs is the desert. It is like the support, like the support of desire itself.\n\nWhat is going to attach itself? In a schizoanalysis, the problem of the unconscious is not a problem of generations. [André] Green has dispatched an article on Anti-Oedipus, and he says: in any case, these guys are a bit dim, because they’re forgetting that a schizo still has a father and a mother.[5] Well, that’s just lamentable: listen to a schizo. A schizo has neither father nor mother, it’s so obvious. It is not as a schizo that he is born of a father and of a mother – a schizo, as schizo, has no father or mother, he has a body without organs. The problem of the unconscious is not a problem of generations, but of population.[6] What populates the body without organs, what makes assemblages, connections? Someone’s happiness is their own way of making bodies without organs. As a fundamental difference with psychoanalysis, I insist once again: we do not know in advance. This duff concept of regression, it’s a way of saying: what you are is your affair, at least in principle, we know it in advance, since what you are is what you are. While here it’s the opposite principle: you don’t know in advance what you are. It’s the same with accounts of drugs: you don’t know in advance.\n\nThere is a very beautiful book by a gentleman called [Carlos] Castaneda which recounts his apprenticeship in peyote with an Indian, and the Indian explains to him that whatever the case, you need an ally.[7] You need a benefactor to guide you in this apprenticeship, this is the Indian himself, but you also need an ally, that is to say something which has a power. In order to make yourself a body without organs – a very lofty task, a very sublime task – an ally is necessary, not necessarily someone else, but you need an ally which will be the point of departure for a whole assemblage capable of functioning on such a body.\n\nWe saw, last time, on this body without organs, a kind of mass distribution, phenomena of mass, of population.[8] Why do these organize themselves? Because the immediate effect of the body without organs is identical with the experience, the experimentation, of a depersonalization. What seems fascinating to me is that it is at the very moment of an attempt at depersonalization that one acquires the true meaning of proper names, that is to say, one receives one’s true proper name at the very moment of depersonalization. Why?\n\nLet’s suppose that there are groupings of mass, these are not necessarily social masses, because here, in relation to the body without organs, as opposed to the organism of a subject, the subject itself gives itself over to crawling around on the BwO, to tracing spirals. It conducts its search on the body without organs like a guy walking about [se balade] in the desert. This is the test of desire. Like the Unnameable in Beckett, it traces its spirals.[9] It itself, as depersonalized on the BwO, even its very organs, which in so far as they are now related, not to its organism, but to the body without organs – they have all completely changed their relationships. Once again, the BwO is indeed a defection from the organism, the disorganization of the organism for the benefit of another instance; and this other instance, the organs of the subject, the subject itself, etc., are as if projected onto it, and enter into a new kind of relation with other subjects. All that takes shape like masses, pullulations, where, literally, on the body without organs, one no longer really knows who is who: my hand, your eye, a shoe. A camel on the BwO of the desert, a jackal, a man on the camel, that makes up a chain.\n\nAt this level, in any case, the mass inscribed on the body without organs delimits like a territory. The elements of mass, whatever they are, define signs. And what ensures the coherence, the connections between signs?\n\nWhat defines the mass, it seems to me, is a whole system of networks between signs. Sign refers to sign. That’s the mass system. And it refers to the sign under the condition of a major signifier. Here we have the paranoid system. The whole force of Lacan is to have made psychoanalysis pass from the Oedipal apparatus to the paranoid machine. There is a major signifier which subsumes the signs, which maintains them in the mass system, which organizes their network. That seems to me to be the criterion of paranoid delirium: it’s the phenomenon of the network of signs, where sign refers to sign.[10]\n\nRyjik: You’re making some kind of description, it’s not very clear, but you’re describing something. And if there is the same collection without a signifier, what is that?\n\nDeleuze: That’s next.\n\nRyjik: But does that form a network, or does it not form a network?\n\nDeleuze: It forms a thread [enfilade], not a network.\n\nIt is necessary to see how this major signifier appears. The purely descriptive system says: there is a regime of the sign under the signifier, and this is the network such as we find it in paranoid delirium. This seems to me the first stage of what it would be necessary to call the deterritorialization of the sign. It’s when, on a territory, the sign, instead of being a sign as such, passes – Have you finished coughing up? It’s disgusting – passes under the domination of a signifier. Your question is substantial: where does this signifier come from?\n\nSigns, in another mode altogether, follow trajectories of flight; there is all the same a concrete criterion. This time, it is no longer the sign referring to another sign in a network, it is a direction starting from which a sign enters into a linear thread [s’enfile] with other signs. As opposed to paranoid delirium, it is for example erotomaniac delirium[11], or grievance delusion.[12] All of this still happens on the BwO. The sign, this time, has liberated itself from the mortgage and domination of the signifier. In which form it liberates itself from it in order to become and take on the status of director, accelerator and retarder of particles.\n\nThe two coexisting states of the sign are: the paranoid sign, namely the sign under the signifier, forming a network insofar as it is subsumed by the signifier, and then: the sign-particle, liberated from the signifier and serving as teleguidance for a particle.\n\nThe body without organs is populated in a singular fashion. It is no longer masses, species of coexisting lines, that always traverse this desert, and that guide particles on coexisting lines that diverge and intersect. Anything is possible in things like this. It is no longer the mass phenomenon, it is the pack [meute] phenomenon. It’s not at all the same thing because the subject, i.e. this weird kind of thing which is sometimes in the mass, sometimes in packs, enters into connection under the form of a network with other subjects, other organs, but sometimes in accordance with its lines of flight, where it also enters into specific types of relationship with others, but in pack relationships and no longer ones of mass.\n\nThe huge difference between the position of mass and the position of pack is why I’m so interested in the Wolf Man, and Freud’s radical non-understanding. The position of mass is always a position affected with paranoid characteristics; this is all the less pejorative as for me, this year, it’s all about saying: long live paranoia, there is not enough of it, we need to fix that …\n\nRyjik: Well, that’s something different! [Laughter]\n\nDeleuze: The paranoid position of mass is: I will be in the mass, I will not separate myself from the mass, and I will be at the heart of the mass, in two possible capacities: either as chief, and therefore having a certain relationship of identification with the mass – for the mass can be the grave[13], it can be an empty mass, it doesn’t matter; or as partisan where, in any case, it is necessary to be swept up in the crowd [masse], to be as close as possible to the crowd, with one condition: to avoid being on the edge [bordure]. It is necessary to avoid being on the edge, being on the margins, in the position of mass: to not be last, you have to be close to the chief. The border is a position that it is only possible to guarantee in a mass, so that when one is in service, one must be there.\n\nHenri Gobard: On the problem of the edge: if one is on the inside, there is no edge … Everything you say is a kind of fantastic justification of anything whatever, in any way whatever, for anywhere wherever …\n\nRichard Zrehen: … and for anyone whoever!\n\nGobard: Maybe not for anyone whoever, that’s the problem; in your desert, instead of putting a camel, put a white bear: what will happen? How would your analysis work on something which, to me, seems monstrous, truly worse than Nazism, if that’s possible: namely the transplantation of organs! Cardiac patients no longer have organs, an organ is transplanted into them, … I’m against it, because it leads to the transformation of bodies into systems of spare parts, and that is precisely the Nazi mentality of the concentration camps … [Christiaan] Barnard is a Nazi, and contemporary science, biology and medicine belongs to the Nazi type …[14]\n\nA student: Why did you have to sit there next to Deleuze, instead of sitting at the back?\n\nGobard: No, no, if you had arrived earlier, you would have seen that I sat here in order to make a sounding board. Someone was making a recording; and secondly, because it was pissing me off with all the assholes smoking …[15]\n\nRichard Zrehen: I was wondering whether the intensive powers on the body without organs, the thresholds of intensity, the energetic passages, if you like, whose schema has been borrowed from embryology, even if it is no longer just that, since it is all the same a serious basis, I wondered if there was not a way of ‘quantifying’ or ‘qualifying’ these thresholds, these passages, these fillings-up through intensive quantities, of the body without organs; and immediately, the only association I could make was the modification of colors indicating an intensity in the level of the cold or the heat given off, something like that. You just talked about statements which, visibly, on the body without organs, exactly fulfill, perhaps at another level, the foundation of intensive powers.\n\nDeleuze: Yes, yes, yes, but I am so far from having finished. The intensities, I haven’t placed them on the inside yet, but I would see no reason to privilege colors or phenomena of hot or cold; localizations also count for a lot. The Wolf Man, his relationship with wolves, is absolutely inseparable from two bodily localizations, which are the jaw and the anus. The psychoanalyst who took over with the young man after Freud says that the Wolf Man says that one of his dentists keeps telling him: you have too hard a bite, your teeth will fall out.[16] There, we clearly see something of a kind of current of intensity: a higher intensity, the jaw-bite; the teeth too fragile for such a jaw-bite: lower intensity; and what we have there is a definite kind of passage of intensity between a minimum and a maximum, which is of a very particular type, of a localization type.\n\nTo return to the position of mass, one can say that there is no edge, for the simple reason that the problem of the mass is: to determine segregation and exclusion. There are simply falls and rises. The position of pack is completely different. Its essential character is that there is a border-phenomenon. The essential always happens at the edge. In the book Crowds and Power [Masse et Puissance] by [Elias] Canetti there is a very good description of the pack. He says something very important about the distinction between mass and pack (page 109): “In the pack which, from time to time, forms out of the group, and which most strongly expresses its feeling of unity” – that’s strange, that’s not true – “the individual can never lose itself as completely as modern man can in any crowd today. In the changing constellation of the pack …” – he, at least, understands wolves: in the pack each member guides itself through its companion, and at the same time, the positions never cease varying. They vary all the time, and they define themselves through distances. Distances between the members of the pack. Distances which are constantly variable and indecomposable. This is what makes it so that the pack is always distributed over, that the members of the pack are always on, a periphery. “In the changing constellation of the pack […], he will again and again find himself at its edge. He may be in the center, and then, immediately afterwards, at the edge again; at the edge and then back in the center. When the pack forms a ring round the fire” – that’s quite stirring, that bit – “each man will have neighbors to right and left, but no one behind him; his back is naked and exposed to the wilderness.”[17] This is absolutely the position of pack. I adhere to the pack through – so here, it is indeed another regime of organs, it is not a regime of networks – I adhere to the pack through a foot, a hand, a paw, through the anus, through an eye. This is the position of pack.\n\nI add, there is all that at the same time on the body without organs: the paranoid [parano] position of mass, the schizo position of pack, and I mean: packs, masses, all these types of multiplicity. The unconscious is the art of multiplicities; this is a way of saying that psychoanalysis understands nothing at all since it has always treated the unconscious from the point of view of an art of unities: the father, the mother, castration. Every time psychoanalysts find themselves faced with multiplicities, as we have seen with the Wolf Man, it is a question of denying that there are multiplicities. Freud cannot bear the idea that there are six or seven wolves in the story of the Wolf Man; it is necessary that there is only one, because a single wolf, that’s the father. And the Wolf Man can cry all he likes: the wolves, the wolves, the wolves; Freud says: a single wolf, a single wolf, a single wolf.\n\nThese masses and these packs of the unconscious can just as well be existing groups, but these existing groups, for example, political groups, they also have an unconscious, an unconscious – and here, I’m saying at the same time – that’s why everything functions together. It is no longer a question of saying: let’s oppose paranoid/schizophrenic in a duality, because the same group has a mass unconscious and a pack unconscious as well. It lives off a whole system of signifying signs, under the signifier, but at the same time, it lives off a whole system of particle-signs which are its ways of getting the hell out, its ways of drifting. It is at once the most immobile bloc and simultaneously the most adrift thing there is. It is therefore at the same time that it is necessary to make all that function. To these two machinic poles apparatuses are added. If I try to define the two machinic poles which, for the moment, cover the bodies without organs, I would say that the one is the mass machine, which one could call the semiotic signifying machine: it is the system of signs under the domination of the signifier, and forming the paranoid network. The other machine, that of the sign-particles, the pack machine, is the semiotic a-signifying machine: it is the sign-particle system, the coupling of sign and particle. Each member of a pack is a particle, each particle could be anything; as a mass element, it could be anything.\n\nSo, upon that, apparatuses intervene that are certainly linked to these machines. And again, it’s not a question of saying: Oedipus does not exist. It’s about saying: there is only an Oedipal apparatus, and the Oedipal apparatus, it’s a funny thing, because it plays between the mass machines and the pack machines. Its whole play is between the two; it borrows elements from mass machines. I believe that the meaning of the Oedipal apparatus is to plug the flights of packs, to bring them back to the masses … I’m forgetting a lot of things in the current, but another distinction that it would be necessary to make between mass machines and those belonging to packs, would be that masses, at least in appearance, always present, at a certain moment, a phenomenon of unity of direction. They are simultaneously egalitarian and hierarchised. We must not at all say, like the Marxists, that egalitarianism is an ideological phenomenon, or that it is a certain formal phenomenon; it must be said that class organization, in historical formations, in its most diverse forms, has always been made in real relation – it does not at all belong to ideology – with some form of communitarian egalitarianism. Class organization in the bourgeois system is made in the form of a real equality determined under the conditions of capitalism. Class formation in the so-called despotic systems implies the real egalitarianism of rural communities. Class organization in the ancient city implies the victory of the plebs; that, as Engels says very well, implies a certain position of egalitarianism in relation to which slavery will be able to take place and be produced. So it is not at all opposed, that the mass structure is simultaneously an egalitarian structure, and that it is all the more strongly and more severely hierarchised, presenting a kind of unity of direction at every moment. Whereas the pack phenomenon is really what one calls Brownian motion; whenever there is a pack, you will find this kind of pattern traced on the body without organs.\n\nThe Oedipal apparatus is this strange thing that tries to plug these kinds of flights of particles, and which tries to lead them back. It is necessary to make the four things function in the machinic assemblage at the same time, and this is perhaps what produces the statements of the unconscious. There are counter-Oedipean apparatuses …\n\nRyjik: With what you were saying before, are you trying to say that the Oedipal apparatus has a privileged situation between the two?\n\nDeleuze: No! No more than the counter-Oedipal apparatus. The counter-Oedipal apparatus must no doubt make the inverse manoeuvre; it will let packs loose. You understand, nobody knows in advance for anyone: what might seem most Oedipal, it could very well be that it’s a guy in the process of tipping over into an anti-Oedipal apparatus that will make everything crack. We will never say to someone: you are in regression. Never, never. Or else we will never say to him: you are this because you were that. First of all, it is disgusting, and then it is not true.\n\nI resume. This love so strange of Kafka for Felice[18], what is going on in there? Well, Felice is everywhere. Kafka, what is he up to? First, he has his method … let’s suppose he has found a little something which can serve him as a body without organs. On it, he is in love with Felice. Kafka is all the same an executive, a future great bureaucrat, the whole machine of commerce fascinates him. His problem is once again the situation of the Jews in the Austrian empire; he is caught up in a problem of mass: the imperial mass of the Austrian empire which will precisely be described in The Castle in marvelous terms: when one is far from the castle, it is truly an imperial ensemble, it is a mass, and when one approaches the castle, it is much more like a system of hovels at a distance from each other, as if, to the extent that one approaches, the mass figure melts into a pack figure. And that corresponds very well to the Austrian empire which, experienced from within, is a kind of marquetry, not at all a pyramidal system, but rather a kind of segmentary system. He is caught up in all that, with modern machines, work accidents. He had connections with anarchist circles. The political mass, the imperial mass, the commercial mass, the bureaucratic mass, that’s what he’s concerned with. It is obviously impossible to separate Felice from what she is as well. Kafka, however, takes her for a maid, and it turns out that Felice is not a maid. So here is Felice, who has a certain position in a mass structure, and at the same time, she has big carnivorous teeth, which attracts and disgusts Kafka. He is vegetarian and will cease being vegetarian from the moment of his love affair with Felice; he is fascinated by the idea of teeth between which, in which bits of meat remain, he’s got a weird thing about it.[19] One of Kafka’s fundamental problems is: where does [missing word – ‘food’][20] come from, and this is undoubtedly connected to a position of the body without organs … and these huge carnivorous teeth, that’s another side of it. It is the particle which makes Felice escape, which tears her in some way from the imperial bureaucratic technocratic signifier, makes her break loose onto a completely different line, where, this time, the sign of the big teeth, or rather the Felice-sign, guides, accelerates, and precipitates huge teeth particles, which are set racing in the other coexisting system. Thereupon, third element. Of course, there is Oedipus, and this is Kafka’s problem: how am I going to manage, in the situation I’ve put myself, to not marry Felice? She wants marriage, while he sets his extraordinary conditions: this, this, this. She wants a family right away, she paints him a picture of marriage, it is an innocent one: she wants a homestead, you’ll eat meat everyday …; he faints. Kafka has a habit of turning tricks like that, and it’s fantastic, because that explains the existence of Marthe Robert.[21] There’s a proof of the existence of Marthe Robert for you. Kafka always played a formidable game with his father. His father never stopped winding him up, it’s true: there is therefore an Oedipal statement; but moving quickly, what did Kafka tell himself?\n\nHe said to himself what we need to say to ourselves today about paranoia, but he said it to himself at the level of Oedipus. In the prodigious letters to his sister who had a child, he says that this kid must not be left in the family, he has to get the hell out of there.[22] And for his part, in order to ward off Oedipal statements – because they do exist – he will ward them off in the form: transform the Oedipal statement into an enunciation-machine for making letters.\n\nOnce again, there is no freedom, there are ways out. If one wants freedom, one is asking too much: then one is lost and it’s all fucked in advance. What is needed is to find ways out, and Kafka’s way out is: my father is winding me up, so I’m going to write to him. That will always be the Kafkian way out, converting Oedipus into a writing machine. It is a great idea; and so he writes his famous letter to his father. It is a way out because, thanks to the writing machine, he can add: in other words, I am going to be more Oedipal than you. Exactly as with the paranoiac, one has to succeed at being more paranoid than him. This is why we have to revalorize the paranoid: the only defense against the paranoiac is even more paranoia.\n\nSo Marthe Robert says: you can clearly see how Oedipal he is. Necessarily, he doesn’t stop ladling it on in order to make all Oedipean statements pass into the enunciation of a writing machine that is apparently Oedipal, but in fact is anti-Oedipal, that is to say which is going to splinter Oedipal connections in favor of a system of connections of a perverse writing machine. Once he pulls this off with his father, you know it’s going to work like that even more with the women he loves.\n\nFelice offers him conjugality, that is to say, the adult form of Oedipus. Very quickly, he will counter with the parade he put into effect so well with his father. He is never able to come and see her where she is, because it is necessary that he writes to her; that’s the insurance against conjugality. He sends her all manner of letters, he can only love through letters; he sets conditions, conditions of conditions, etc. In all of that, it is the whole of Oedipus and the whole problem of conjugality that is dissolved, to the benefit of something else altogether.\n\nAnything can work like that. Everything that one puts on the side of the Oedipal apparatus, namely incest, castration, the vacation letter (“My dear Dad, my dear Mum, I am having a lovely holiday”), anything at all, can pass into non-Oedipal apparatuses. And a whole analysis is necessary to arrive at knowledge; that’s why there is always hope. Homosexuality can be like [missing word], completely Oedipal from one end to the other. It all depends on the use; it can pass into other conditions, into an anti-Oedipal apparatus of an entirely different nature.\n\nWhen I speak of a schizo incest, as making up part of an anti-Oedipal apparatus, ie. incest with the sister – but the sister can be anyone, – Oedipal incest is love with someone assimilated with the mother in one way or another; schizo incest is love with someone somehow assimilated with the sister. The passage from Oedipal incest to schizo incest is like a conversion, a transformation of the Oedipal apparatus into an anti-Oedipal apparatus, which means that schizo incest is what opens onto a kind of world of connections and which will lead, literally, to a kind of de-familiarization of the individual. Now, it may very well be that there are incests with the sister which are Oedipal, to the extent that the sister would be treated as the substitute for the mother.[23]\n\nIn order to finish with all this, I would like, just as a bit of a proof, to comment on a text by Kafka, ‘Jackals and Arabs.’[24] One can see very well why he mixes everything up, why he sets traps. In ‘Jackals and Arabs’, we can say that everything is there, for Freud or for Marthe Robert. There are the Arabs who explicitly belong to the male line; and then there are the jackals which are explicitly attached to the maternal line. Right at the beginning, the jackal says: “we have been waiting for you for eternity; my mother waited for you, and her mother, and all our foremothers right back to the first mother of all the jackals.”[25] Between the jackals and the Arabs, there is, on the edge, the man of the North, that is to say the Jackal Man. It’s only Freud who doesn’t know what a pack of wolves is. The jackals take the man of the North aside and say to him that the Arabs are disgusting, and they’re disgusting because they kill animals for food. They kill calves to eat. That’s really Kafka’s fundamental obsession: where does food come from?\n\nThe jackals say that it can’t continue, because they are against it; they say: us, we’re the opposite: we eat to clean up carrion. So: either kill living animals to eat, or eat to clean up dead animals. Hence the Arab-jackal tension. Now the man of the North shows up and the jackals say to him: you’re going to kill the Arabs; and they bring a large pair of rusty scissors. I won’t stop to dwell on what the psychoanalysts are able to make of these scissors. All this is happening in the desert. The Arabs are presented as an armed mass, extended throughout the desert. The jackals are presented as a pack that goes deeper and deeper into the desert, which is forced to plunge deeper and deeper into the desert: mad particles. And at the end of the text, the Arab says about the jackals: “they’re madmen, complete madmen.”[26] And the jackals reveal the secret of the story of the scissors – the man of the North was ready to say: you want me to kill them, but the jackals aren’t interested in that: it’s a question of cleanliness, it’s the test of the desert. That means that, in this kind of tension, the Arab mass, the pack of jackals, a manifest Oedipal apparatus and a counter-Oedipal apparatus, will put in play the test of desire under the form: it is a question of cleanliness.\n\nOnce these four elements are given, what will happen, if I am granted that every statement is the product of an assemblage? How might we define a statement as the product of a machinic assemblage? It goes without saying that all that is indeed the problem of unconscious, i.e. that an analysis which does not reach multiplicities, a double type of multiplicities, multiplicities of mass and multiplicities of packs, which are now in a double way what an individual participates in, as well as being what is internal to an individual – well, we can say that the analysis has not even begun. When one has not reached the edge-positions, the paranoiac positions of mass, the type of anti-Oedipal apparatus someone is in the process of setting up, their Oedipal apparatus, one has got absolutely nowhere near the formations of the unconscious – and above all when one does not know what assemblage is involved, and how it functioned for them and in them, that is to say, what type of statement it was capable of producing; and types of statements, when necessary, which are very far from what happens in the unconscious.\n\nThis is the problem of multiplicities, to put each thing into play in the others, like multiplicities of multiplicities. It is this analysis of multiplicities as being simultaneously exterior and interior to the individual that must be achieved, otherwise one has attained nothing of the unconscious. [End of the session]\n\nNotes\n\n[1] The term énoncé can be translated as ‘statement’ or ‘utterance’. In this Seminar, Deleuze is playing off various contemporary uses of the term énoncé, e.g., in Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge (translated by A.M. Sheridan-Smith, London: Tavistock, 1972 [1969]); in Jean-Pierre Faye, Théorie du Récit [Theory of Narrative] (Paris: Hermann, 1972) (discussed in the fourth and fifth sessions of this Seminar); and in Jacques Lacan’s opposition between the sujet de l’énoncé [‘subject of the statement’] and the sujet de l’énonciation [‘subject of enunciation’]; cf. Lacan, ‘The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire’, in Écrits (translated by Bruce Fink et al., New York: W.W. Norton, 2006 [1966]), pp. 800-802 [French pagination].\n\n[2] The term agencement has no exact English translation, and might be translated as ‘arrangement’, ‘layout’, ‘configuration’, or ‘assemblage’. The last-named term is used here, but it should be borne in mind that the French term carries connotations of agency and activation that are absent from the English ‘assemblage’.\n\n[3] Cf. Marcel Detienne, ‘La phalange. Problèmes et controverses’, in Jean-Pierre Vernant, Problèmes de la guerre en Grèce ancienne (Paris – La Haye: Mouton and Co., 1968), discussed in A Thousand Plateaus (translated by Brian Massumi, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987 [1980]), pp. 399 and 560 n.78.\n\n[4] Cf. A Thousand Plateaus, p. 37: “There are no individual statements, there never are. Every statement is the product of a machinic assemblage, in other words, of collective agents of enunciation (take “collective agents” to mean not peoples or societies but multiplicities).” The missing French phrase would be comme multiplicités. Much of the material developed in this session finds its way into this plateau, ‘1914: One or Several Wolves’, in A Thousand Plateaus (pp. 26-38).\n\n[5] André Green’s review of Anti-Oedipus, ‘À quoi ça sert’, was published in Le Monde on 28 April 1972, and then republished in expanded form in the Revue française de psychanalyse, vol. 36(3), 1972, pp. 491-499. Deleuze is presumably referring to the closing passage: “The whole book is based on the assertion that the schizo does not play Oedipus and rejects our system. Does this mean that he has neither father nor mother? Can we affirm that the schizo, in his psychosis, maintains no relationship with the imago of his progenitors? The whole of experience and theory are against this” (Revue française version, p. 499).\n\n[6] In the article, Green claims that “Anti-Oedipus is the negation of the double difference (of the sexes and generations)” (ibid, p. 497).\n\n[7] Carlos Castaneda, The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1972 [1968]). On the ‘ally’, see pp. 9, 32-34. For discussions of Castaneda in A Thousand Plateaus, cf. pp. 227-229, 248-249.\n\n[8] The reference to the “last session” points to the existence of a session (or sessions) prior to this one. The final session of the first Seminar on Anti-Oedipus (18 April 1972) ends with a discussion of the body without organs, but there is no discussion of ‘masses.’ Elias Canetti’s Crowds and Power (translated by Carol Stewart, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973 [1960]) is not mentioned in the first Seminar, nor is the idea of ‘mass’ thematized. However, Canetti’s distinction between crowds and packs is briefly mentioned in Anti-Oedipus itself (translated by Robert Hurley, Mark Seem and Helen R. Lane, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1983), p. 279, where it is discussed in relation to paranoia (with a reference to the closing chapter of Crowds and Power, ‘Rulers and Paranoiacs’). Crowds and Power was originally entitled Masse und Macht in German (1960) and was translated into French as Masse et puissance (Paris: Gallimard, 1966). In German, Freud’s Group Psychology is Massenpsychologie. The term ‘mass’ in the present Seminar often means ‘crowd’, and its use can be related to themes in the first part of Canetti’s Crowds and Power, ‘The Crowd’, pp. 15-87. See the discussion of masses and packs in A Thousand Plateaus, p. 33-34.\n\n[9] Cf. Samuel Beckett, The Unnameable, in Trilogy (London: Picador, 1979 [1959]): “I must have got embroiled in a kind of inverted spiral” (p. 290); “I’ve never left the island, God help me. I was under the impression I spent my life in spirals round the earth” (p. 300).\n\n[10] In a discussion of early 20th century psychiatry in A Thousand Plateaus (pp. 119-120), singling out the work of Paul Sérieux and Joseph Capgras on the one hand and Gaëtan de Clérambault on the other, Deleuze and Guattari develop a contrast between a “paranoid-interpretive ideal regime of significance”, which they associate with ‘delusion [or delirium] of interpretation’, and a “passional, postsignifying subjective regime”, associated with ‘passional’ delusions like erotomania and grievance delusion [délire de revendication]. It is likely that this distinction also has a source in Lacan’s extensive discussion of Sérieux and Capgras’ work Les Folies raisonnantes [Reasoning Madness] (1st ed. 1906), along with Clérambault’s work and other related works from the French school, in his doctoral thesis De la psychose paranoiaque dans ses rapports avec la personnalité [On Paranoid Psychosis in its Relations with the Personality] (Paris: Seuil, 1975 [1932]), pp. 64-76. Delirium of interpretation is twice described there as “radiating” out from a central delusion (p. 67; cf. 71). Lacan in turn roots Sérieux and Capgras’ account of paranoid interpretation in Kraepelin’s classic formulation of paranoia as “the insidious development, under the dependence of internal causes and according to a continuous evolution, of a durable and unshakable delirious system [système délirant], and which is established with a complete retention of clarity and of order in thought, will and action” (first given in the 1899 edition of his Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie) (Lacan, p. 23). Deleuze’s formulation here of paranoid interpretation as involving networks in which ‘sign refers to sign’ seems to arise out of this context.\n\n[11] Lacan, De la psychose paranoiaque dans ses rapports avec la personnalité, pp. 24 and 72 (where Clérambault’s work on erotomania is discussed).\n\n[12] There is no exact English translation for the French term revendication, frequently used in Lacan’s 1932 dissertation on paranoid psychosis and common among the French psychiatrists he discusses. Délire de revendication is sometimes translated into English as ‘litigious delusion’, sometimes more literally as ‘delusion of claim’. The translation ‘grievance delusion’ has a greater extension than ‘litigious delusion’ (which is more suited to the specific phenomenon of vexatious litigation).\n\n[13] Possibly a reference to Elias Canetti, Crowds and Power, ‘Cemeteries’, p. 275.\n\n[14] The transcript of this passage ends with the non-word “esclaruerunt …?”\n\n[15] A note in the WebDeleuze transcript adds: “Nota Bene: Richard III, on this day, had no ‘havana’ at his disposal.”\n\n[16] Ruth Mack Brunswick, ‘A Supplement to Freud’s History of an Infantile Neurosis’ (1928), republished in Muriel Gardiner (ed.) The Wolf-Man by the Wolf-Man (New York: Basic Books, 1971), p. 277: “The dentist now told him […] that he had a ‘hard bite’ and would soon probably lose not only the fillings, but all his teeth as well.” With regard to the anus, see Sigmund Freud, ‘From the History of an Infantile Neurosis’ (The ‘Wolf Man’), chapter VII, ‘Anal Erotism and the Castration Complex’.\n\n[17] Elias Canetti, Crowds and Power, p. 109, cited in A Thousand Plateaus, p. 33-34.\n\n[18] Franz Kafka, Letters to Felice, edited by Erich Heller and Jürgen Born, translated by James Stern and Elisabeth Duckworth, New York: Schocken Books, 1973).

Purdue University Research Repository. doi:10.4231/7PY9-XP63\n\n\n\n\nGilles Deleuze\n\nSeminar on Anti-Oedipus/A Thousand Plateaus, 1972-1973\n\nLecture 02, 26 March 1973\n\nTranscribed by WebDeleuze\n\nTranslated by Daniel W. Smith\n\nDualism, Monism and Multiplicities; Desire-Pleasure-Jouissance\n\nIn the Archaeology of Knowledge, Foucault said some profound things about statements [énoncés] that concern several domains at once, even if not at the same time. I take two very vague examples. There is a moment in the Greek City when statements of a new type emerge, and these statements of a new type emerge within assignable temporal arrangements, in several domains. They can be statements concerning love, concerning marriage, concerning war, yet we feel that there is a kind of kinship or community among these statements. We have seen certain thinkers try to give explanations of how statements emerge in diverse domains that have this kind of kinship. In Greece, for example, during the “hoplite” reform, new types of statements concerning war and strategy emerge, but also new statements concerning marriage and politics. All this, it has been said, cannot be unrelated.\n\nThere are some people who immediately say, for example, that there is a system of analogies or a system of homologies, and that perhaps all these statements refer to a common structure. They are called: structuralists. Others will say that these productions of statements depend on a certain domain which is determinative in relation to the others. Such people, for example, we will call: Marxists. Perhaps it would be better to look for something else.\n\nThere’s a book from which one can learn many things, titled Sexual Life in Ancient China [by Robert H. van Gulik (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1961)]. This book shows clearly that manuals of love and manuals of military strategy are indiscernible, and that new strategic and military statements are produced at the same time as new amorous statements. That’s curious. I ask myself: OK, how can we extract ourselves, at the same time, from a structuralist vision that seeks correspondences, analogies, and homologies, and from a Marxist vision that seeks determinants. I indeed see one possible hypothesis, but it’s so confused . . . It’s perfect. It would consist in saying: at a given moment, for reasons that, of course, must still be determined, it is as if a social space were covered by what we would have to call an abstract machine. We would have to give a name to this non-qualified abstract machine, a name that would mark its absence of qualification, so that everything will be clear. We could call it — at the same time, this abstract machine, at a given moment, will break with the abstract machine of the preceding epochs — in other words, it will always be at the cutting edge [à la pointe], thus it would receive the name machinic point [pointe machinique]. It would be the machinic point of a group or a given collectivity; it would indicate, within a group and at a given moment, the maximum of deterritorialization as well as, and at the same time, its power of innovation. This is somewhat abstract at the moment, it’s like algebra. It’s this abstract machine which, in conditions that will have to be determined, it’s this machinic point of deterritorialization that is reterritorialized in this or that machine, or in this or that military machine, amorous machine, productive of new statements. This is a possible hypothesis.\n\nI have the impression that there are things in [André] Leroi-Gourhan we could use here, we would have to see how that works. This machinic point would indicate a kind of speed of deterritorialization. There are systems of indices under which reterritorializations are made in qualified machines, war machines, machines of love, machines of marriage.\n\nKyril Ryjik: This is your “series” [enfilades] which are taken up again in networks?\n\nDeleuze: Ah, no, that’s something else. As you sense, at bottom this is not our hypothesis. That’s because in this problem of where statements come from, what their production is related to, the sub-jacent response will consist in answering: there are no individual statements, and this is one of the multiple traps of psychoanalysis, which is the successor of a type of thinking which we could call Western thought and which says that there are individual statements. And finally, the form or logic of individual statements has been fixed by the cogito. It has been fixed by the cogito which comprehends the production of statements from the subject, from a subject. Cogito: this means that every statement is the production of a subject. It means that first; and second, it means that every statement splits the subject that produces it. Lacan is the last Cartesian. Then every statement refers to a subject, and every statement splits, cuts, separates the subject that produces it. These are propositions that are linked up naturally, because if it is true that a statement is produced by a subject, then for that very reason, this subject will be divided into the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement. This is what the literal process [démarche] of the cogito consists of.\n\nThe process of the cogito, you recall, is: I can say “I think, therefore I am,” but I can’t say “I walk, therefore I am.” Descartes explains this in his Responses to Objections, in Descartes’s rare comic pages. Someone has objected, “Why don’t you say ‘I walk’ like ‘I am’?” and he says, “I can’t.” That amounts to saying that “I walk” is a subject of the statement, whereas “I think” is the subject of enunciation. [In this regard, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 128]\n\nThen, perhaps I’m not walking, but there’s one thing I’m sure of, and that is that I’m thinking of walking. In other words, the subject cannot produce a statement without being thereby split [scindé] by the statement into a subject of enunciation and a subject of the statement. This introduces the entire metaphysics of the subject into psychoanalysis. If we look closely at the cogito. . .\n\nA student: But there is no alterity in Descartes.\n\nDeleuze: What is it that you are looking for? And dualism! There is a dualism at the level of thought and the object thought. There is a dualism at the level of soul and body, there are as many dualisms as you like. And if we ask: What is the source of all the Cartesian dualisms? — it lies in this scission internal to the subject, between the subjects of the statement, which allow no conclusion, and a subject of enunciation, which is subtracted from doubt: “I think.”\n\nIn the entire series of Cartesian dualisms (soul-body, thought-extension, statement-enunciation), the only remark and the only question is that this isn’t the final aspect. The duality of subjects of the statement and subjects of enunciation — once again, the subjects of statements of the type “I am walking,” “I am breathing,” “I imagine,” and the subjects of enunciation “I think” — Is it not this duality that will inhabit all the dualisms of reflection and all the other dualisms of substances, bodies, etc.?\n\nI take up again, I’m thinking of the text where Descartes says, it may be — I see a unicorn, or I imagine a unicorn — it may indeed be that the unicorn does not exist, it may very well be that the proposition, that the statement “I see a unicorn” is false. But in return, it’s true that I think I am seeing a unicorn. At this level, a kind of disengagement of a subject of enunciation occurs, and thereby all the subjects of possible statements. Whence he will say to you: I cannot say “I walk, therefore I am,” for from a subject of the statement, I cannot conclude a being of enunciation, or the being of a subject of enunciation; but I can say “I think, therefore I am,” because from a subject of enunciation I can conclude the being of this subject.\n\nNow all the dualisms of Descartes, even passion and action, depend strictly on this operation of the cogito, which consists of relating statements to a subject of enunciation, which will consequently split the subject in two: the subject of the statement, and the subject of enunciation. This will be found, for example, at the Cartesian level, in the subject of the statement, which in the end refers to the union of the soul with the body, and the subject of enunciation, which refers to the thinking subject. When I say that, in a certain manner, psychoanalysis is the final inheritor of Cartesianism, it is because, even looking at the cogito, it is very curious at what point it is an Oedipal apparatus, a sublimated Oedipal apparatus. [On Descartes and the cogito, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 128-129]\n\nIt could very well be that I myself, as a living being, have been made by my father and my mother. But the fact that I think, that isn’t explained by my father and mother, that’s explained by what? If we consider the cogito as a machine, we can see three great moments in it: doubt–which is typically a type of paranoiac machine; the non-deceiving God is a miraculating [trans: reading “miraculante” for “déraillante”] machine, and the “I think” is a celibate machine. That is the Oedipal space of pure thought. There are Oedipuses everywhere; there are not only familial Oedipuses, there are also scientific Oedipuses; and the philosophical Oedipus is the cogito, it is the Oedipal machine at the level of thought. This is what one calls dualism. Dualism is what prevents thought. Dualism always wants to deny the essence of thought, namely, that thought is a process. And the source of dualism, it seems to me, is this type of reduction, this flattening of all statements of thought, precisely, by this speculative, Oedipal apparatus in which the statement, on the one hand, is related to the subject, to a subject, and on the other hand, and simultaneously, the subject is split into a subject of the statement and the subject of enunciation. In this perspective, the subject is rethought.\n\nThere is only one form of thought, it’s the same thing: one can only think in a monistic or pluralistic manner. The only enemy is two. Monism and pluralism: it’s the same thing, because, in a certain manner, it seems to me that every opposition, even all possibilities of oppositions between the one and the multiple . . . This is because the source of dualism is precisely the opposition between something that can be affirmed as one, and something that can be affirmed as multiple, and more precisely, what signals it as one is precisely the subject of enunciation, and what signals it as multiple is always the subject of the statement . . . [On this same development of the “one” and the “multiple”, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 32-34]\n\nWe saw last time how to bring about the suppression of the opposition between the one and the multiple. It happens the moment the one and the multiple cease to be adjectives and give way to the substantive: there are only multiplicities. That is to say, when the substantive “multiplicities” takes the place of the one, of the multiple and their … [missing text, perhaps: adjectives], and at this moment, one and multiple lose absolutely all meaning, at the same time as the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement. There are multiplicities, which obviously implies a theory and practice of multiplicities. Wherever we leave the domain of multiplicities, we once again fall into dualisms, i.e., into the domain of non-thought, we leave the domain of thought as process.\n\nNow to show at what point things become botched, I always think of this history of desire. What I have been saying since the beginning amounts to saying that thinking and desiring are the same thing. The best way to avoid seeing or to refuse to see that desire is thought, that the position of desire in thought is a veritable process, is obviously to link desire to lack. Once desire is linked to lack, one is immediately in the domain, one has already assumed the basis of dualism. But today I would like to say that there are more underhanded ways of reintroducing lack into desire, either through the Other, or through dualism. Here, so-called Western thought is constructed from the relation between desire and pleasure, a completely rotten [pourrie] conception.\n\nThe first malediction of desire, the first malediction that weighs on desire like a Christian curse, and goes back to the Greeks, is that desire is lack. The second malediction is: desire will be satisfied by pleasure, or will be in an enunciable relation with jouissance. Of course, there will be those who will tell us that these are not the same thing. Nonetheless, there is a peculiar circuit here: desire-pleasure-jouissance. And all that, once again, is a way of cursing and liquidating desire. [For this same sequence of maledictions, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 154]\n\nThe idea of pleasure is a completely rotten [pourrie] idea. One only has to look at Freud’s texts, at the level of desire-pleasure, which amount to saying that desire is above all a disagreeable tension. There are one or two texts where Freud says that, after all, perhaps there are agreeable tensions, but again that doesn’t take us very far. Broadly speaking, desire is lived as such a disagreeable tension that — a horrible, hideous word is required here, that’s how bad this thing is — a discharge is necessary. And this discharge, this is what pleasure is! People will have peace, and then, alas! desire is reborn, a new discharge will be necessary. The types of conceptions that are called, in scholarly terms, hedonistic, namely, the search for pleasure, and the types of mystical conceptions that curse desire, by virtue of what is fundamental in lack — I would simply like you to sense that, in any case, they both consider desire to be a dirty little thing that wakes us up, and that wakes us up in the most disagreeable manner: either by putting us in relation with a fundamental lack, which can then be assuaged by a kind of activity of discharge, and then one will have peace, and then it will all begin over again . . . . When one introduces the notion of jouissance into all that — you can see I’m in the process of trying to make a circle, very muddled, a pious circle, a religious circle of the theory of desire — we can see to what an extent psychoanalysis is impregnated, and how great the psychoanalytic piety is. This circle, one of its segments is desire-lack, another segment is pleasure-discharge, and once again, they are completely linked.\n\nAnd then I ask myself: What’s wrong with Reich? There are two great errors in Reich: the first error is dualism, then he passes to the side: it’s the dualism between two economies, between a political economy and a libidinal economy. If one speaks of a duality between two economies, one will always be able to promise to make the connection [branchement], but the connection will never be made. And this error of dualism has a repercussion at another level: desire is still thought of as a lack, and thus it is still thought with pleasure, as its unit of measure. And Reich has indeed given the word pleasure a stronger and more violent word, he calls it orgasm. His entire conception of the orgasm, which he will try to turn against Freud, consists in pushing desire to the limit insofar as it is linked to lack. If it cannot manage to obtain the discharge that assuages it, it will produce what Reich calls stasis. Desire is fundamentally related to the orgasm, and in order to relate desire to pleasure or to the orgasm, one must relate it to lack. It is exactly the same thing. The first proposition is the inverse of the second.\n\nIf we add the third arc of the circle: desire-lack, all that always concerns desire which is directed toward transcendence. In effect, if desire lacks something, it is like intentionality aiming at what it lacks, it is defined as a function of transcendence, in the same way that is it measured as a function of a unit that is not its own, which will be pleasure or the orgasm, which assures its discharge. And, in order to close the circle, which for the moment has only two arcs — obviously, the theme that consists in establishing a distinction between jouissance and pleasure is very useful. This is what will make the whole thing function together. I am thinking notably of a distinction dear to Lacan, but I’m not familiar with it, the distinction between jouissance and pleasure.\n\nI recall what Barthes said about it in his last book, The Pleasure of the Text [Paris: Seuil, 1973] where he explains it a little. He distinguishes texts of pleasure and texts of jouissance. This is what he says about texts of pleasure: “the text that contents, fills, grants euphoria; the text that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a comfortable practice of reading. Text of jouissance: the text that imposes a state of loss, the text that discomforts, … unsettles the reader’s historical, cultural, psychological assumptions, the consistency of his tastes, values, memories… Now the subject who keeps the two texts in his field and in his hands the reins of pleasure and jouissance is an anachronic subject, for he simultaneously and contradictorily participates in the profound hedonism of all culture … and in the destruction of that culture: he enjoys the consistency of his selfhood (that is his pleasure) and seeks its loss” — the loss of self –“(that is his bliss [jouissance]). He is a subject split twice over, doubly perverse.” [Barthes, The Pleasure of the Text (Hill & Wang, 1975, trans. Richard Miller, p.14; trans. modified]\n\nIncredible. We here recover the duality of the subject of the statement, capable of pleasure, and the subject of enunciation, deserving of jouissance. Only, just as the subject of the statement never raises itself to the subject of enunciation, because the subject of enunciation is finally the great signifier, it goes without saying that jouissance is impossible. This means, as Barthes is in the process of explaining, that jouissance is in a fundamental relationship with death, so that we can close our circle: desire-lack, desire-pleasure or orgasm, desire jouissance.\n\nHappily, in an even clearer text, Barthes goes so far as to say: “Is pleasure only a minor bliss? Is bliss nothing but extreme pleasure?” No. It’s not that one is stronger than the other, or the other less strong; they differ in nature. If one says that pleasure and jouissance are “parallel forces, that they cannot meet, and that between them is more than a struggle: an incommunication, then I must certainly believe that history, our history, is not peacable and perhaps not even intelligent, that the text of bliss always rises out of it like a scandal (an irregularity), that it is always the trace of a cut, of an assertion…” [Barthes, Pleasure, p.20, trans. modified]. We could go on. . . .  What’s happening here?\n\nI’m thinking of this book on sexual life in ancient China. It recounts a strange story, in the end we are all Chinese: in Taoism, it varies throughout the ages, in any case, the reader is struck by the glory of the men and women in it. . . . But that’s not what marks its difference from Western thought, because, from the side of Western thought, that doesn’t work more strongly; the difference is elsewhere.\n\nWhat’s different is the way desire is experienced in a totally different manner: it’s not related to any transcendence, it’s not related to any lack, it’s not measured by any pleasure, and it’s not transcended by any jouissance, under the form or myth of the impossible. Desire is posited as a pure process. Concretely, this means that it is not at all the orgasm; their problem is not at all the Western problem, which is: How to extract sexuality from genitality. Their problem is: How to extract sexuality from the orgasm? Then, broadly speaking, they say: You understand, pleasure or orgasm, that’s not the achievement of the process, it is either its interruption or its exasperation, or the two amount to the same thing, and it’s completely deplorable! No doubt, that has to happen, but then one has to perceive these moments of suspension as veritable suspensions that allow the process to once again be set in motion. They have a theory of female energy and male energy, which consists in saying, broadly: female energy is inexhaustible, male energy, it’s more annoying, it’s exhaustible. The problem, in any case, is that the man takes something from the female energy which is inexhaustible, or that each takes something from the other. How can that be done?\n\nFlows are necessary — and indeed this is a thought in terms of flows — the feminine flow, following very determined trajectories, rises up following the lines of masculine flow, along the spinal column, to go to the brain, and that’s desire in its immanence as a process. One borrows a flow, one absorbs a flow, one defines a pure field of immanence of desire, in relation to which pleasure, orgasm, jouissance are defined as veritable suspensions or interruptions. That is, not as the satisfaction of desire, but as the contrary: an exasperation of the process that makes desire come out of its own immanence, i.e., its own productivity. All this is interesting for us, to the degree that, in this thought, desire simultaneously loses any link with lack, with pleasure or orgasm, or with jouissance. It is conceived as the production of a flow, it defines a field of immanence, and a field of immanence–that means a multiplicity in which, effectively, any splitting of the subject into a subject of enunciation and a subject of the statement becomes strictly impossible, since in our revolving machine it was very simple: the subject of enunciation was the subject of impossible jouissance, the subject of the statement was the subject of pleasure and of the search for pleasure, and desire-lack was the splitting of the two. That should tell you to what degree, from Descartes to Lacan, this repugnant thought of the cogito is not only a metaphysical thought.\n\nThe entire history of desire — and once again, Reich falls in the same way — this way of linking desire to a beyond, whether it’s that of lack, or pleasure, or jouissance, and of posing the dualism between the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement. And it isn’t by chance that it’s the same people who are doing it today, i.e., the Lacanians, i.e., engendering all statements from the subject, which consequently, and retroactively, becomes the subject split into the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement. What is inscribed is the subject of enunciation, which links desire with the impossible jouissance; the subject of the statement, which links desire with pleasure; and the cleavage of the two subjects, which links desire with lack or castration. And at the level of theory, the production of statements exactly covers this rotten theory of desire, word for word.\n\nIt is in this sense that I’m saying that thought is indeed monist, in the very apprehension of the identity of thought and process; as well as in the apprehension of the identity of process and desire: desire as constitutive of its own field of immanence, that is, as constitutive of the multiplicities that populate it. But all this is perhaps obscure, a monistic field is indeed a field inhabited by multiplicities.\n\nRyjik: Yes, but I find that dangerous, because monism is considered to be something completely different, like the result of a dialectic coming from dualism. Hegel, for example.\n\nDeleuze: But that’s a false monism.\n\nThis magical operation that consists in forbidding the employment of the adjectives one and multiple, in order to retain only the substantive multiplicities. . . . This is the operation that gives an account of the identity of monism and pluralism, and which related the true source of dualism to the duality established between the two adjectives: the one and the multiple. The ground of dualism has always been: there are things that are one. Here one always recovers Descartes, because today we are talking about Descartes, i.e., Lacan. And then there are things that are divisible. Dualism is not defined by two, dualism is defined by the employment of the one and the multiple as adjectives. This is already true in Duns Scotus.\n\nSo that, instead of using the one and the multiple as adjectives, one substitutes the substantive multiplicities in the form: there is nothing that is one, there is nothing that is multiple, everything is multiplicities. At this moment, one can see the strict identity of monism and pluralism in this form of a process of immanence which can be neither interested — and this is what the Chinese tell us in their sexual wisdom — nor exasperated. The process of immanence is also a multiplicity, i.e., to design a field of immanence populated by a multiplicity.\n\nRyjik: A minute ago, you spoke a dualism as a result of Oedipus. Since, on the other hand, you think of Oedipus as a transitory machine between the affairs of the mass, the pack, or the affairs of paranoia or schizophrenia, you thus have a production of this dualism from a dualism that is proper to you (you don’t return like that) at the level of the functioning of this process. This is what you have been explaining for two or three years.\n\nDeleuze: That has been over for two or three years, it’s finished. Here, today, I am reintroducing no dualism. Forget the rest.\n\nWhen I say: the cogito is Oedipal, it matters little. . . . It would be necessary to find, moreover. . . . The first formulations of the cogito must be in Sophocles’ Oedipus, even in the Cartesian texts, this entire progression is there, the assimilation to the three stages of the Oedipal machine, with paranoiac doubt, the non-deceiving, miraculating God, and the “I think,” that appears to me to be almost [the bachelor machine].\n\nThat is, what I mean is that any theory which, in one way or another, relates the production of statements to a subject is firstly a theory that will necessarily divide the subject in two: the subject of the statement and the subject of enunciation. Secondly, it will involve us in all sorts of submissions, by telling us, in the most hypocritical manner, that you’re the boss! What I would like to make clear is this is all the same thing. And thirdly, the figures of desire, in the sense that desire is linked to lack, or, what amounts to the same thing, desire is linked to the trinity pleasure-orgasm-jouissance. Voilà.\n\nWhy this second point? Why this most hypocritical submission? It is because this history of the splitting of the subject always consists in saying: it is you who command, i.e., you will accede to the commandment to the degree that you submit yourself to a order, which you are not subject to without also being its legislator. This is the famous order of democracy. You are a legislator insofar as you are a subject; and it is not by chance that the person who pushed this doctrine the farthest, the formalism of this doctrine, is the inheritor of Descartes from the viewpoint of the cogito, namely, Kant, and that the submission to reason is presented to us as the manner in which we become legislators. This always refers us to the division of the subject into a subject of the statement and a subject of enunciation: you will obey as the subject of the statement, but because it is you who command as the subject of enunciation, and we are led to grasp this great split identity — as a barred identity, whatever you like — between the legislator and the subject. It’s the same thing; it’s the same mechanism, which thereby claims to engender statements in relation to a subject; which posits the duality of a subject of enunciation and a subject of the statement as the source of all the other dualisms, which thus suppresses thought as a process; and which, thirdly, destroys any position of desire, because by relating desire to lack, pleasure, and jouissance, it in effect leaps in favor of the appearance of thought, i.e., in favor of an image of thought. We could contemplate the image of thought in dualism, whereas there is no reality to thought except in the monism of the process and in the multiplicities that populate the field of immanence.\n\nSo that when the Chinese define this field of immanence of desire traversed by flows — which pursue neither the possible pleasure at the level of the subject of the statement, nor the impossible jouissance at the level of a pseudo-subject of enunciation — at the same time, they give themselves all the conditions for an entire theory of desire and a theory of the production of statements.\n\nA final step to take: Why do they look for the theory of the production of statements in a military art, that is, in a war machine, a strategic war machine, while at the same time looking for the theory of desire in manuals of sexuality? The two types of manuals are strictly [missing word] with each other. Which is to say that they define multiplicities communicating within the process, or within the field of immanence itself.\n\nRyjik: With this little difference, that the manuals of sexology are completely phallocratic and Chinese politics is completely imperial.\n\nDeleuze: OK, but that’s a detail, because that’s not what makes the difference between the East and the West. You could say the same thing about the West; if you’re looking for the difference, it’s certainly not there. That it’s phallocratic and imperial, OK, but that’s more the common background. What this means is that it’s not enough to define desire as a field of immanence in order to escape imperialism, etc.\n\nIs this clear, this relation between the theory of statements and the conception of desire? [Pause in the session]\n\nNo one can say anything about the difference in Lacan between pleasure and jouissance?\n\nA student: Desire entails an enunciable relation with jouissance.\n\nDeleuze: We can see how this all takes part in the same thing. To say that jouissance is not pleasure, that it takes part in a kind of system, which, in order to simplify it, I would present as a circular conception of desire in which, at the bottom, there is always the same starting postulate — and it is true that Western philosophy has always consisted in saying: if desire exists, it is the very sign, or the very fact, that you are lacking something.\n\nEverything starts from that. A first welding of desire-lack is brought about; from there, it goes without saying that desire is defined as a function of a field of transcendence; desire is desire for what one does not have; that begins with Plato, it continues with Lacan. This is the first malediction of desire, it’s the first way to curse desire; but it is not sufficient. — What I’m doing is following Plato’s method in the Phaedo, when he constructs a circle from arcs. —\n\nThe second arc: if desire is fundamentally aimed at an Other, open to a transcendence, if it is subjected to this first malediction, what is it that can come to fulfil it? What can fulfil it will never be the object toward which it tends, except in appearance, for it is the Other, it is unattainable, is the pure transcendent. Thus, that can’t be what fulfils it. What comes to fulfil it or satisfy it, what gives it a pseudo-immanence, will be what is called a state of pleasure. But at this second level, it’s understood that this immanence is a false immanence, since desire has been fundamentally defined in relation to a transcendence, and this fulfilment is, literally, an illusion. Second malediction of desire: it’s a matter of calming desire for a moment, and then the malediction will begin again. And then it will be necessary to call it up again, and then it’s the conception of pleasure-discharge. This word is enough to indicate that the title of this second arc of the circle is “To Provisionally Have Done With Desire.” This is what’s fascinating to me: the point at which all this is retained in Reich’s protest against Freud. He retains this conception of desire-discharge, which he thematizes in the theory of the orgasm. This second arc clearly defines this type of illusory immanence through which pleasure fulfils desire, that is to say, it obliterates it for a while. But, as in any good construction — because all this is a pure construction — it’s not true, it’s false from start to finish.\n\nA third arc is needed to close the circle, since you have this supposed truth of desire linked with a transcendence of the Other, this illusion or this deception through which desire encounters calming discharges in which it disappears, even if it reappears the next day. A third arc is needed to give an account of this: that even through these states of sleep, satisfaction, etc., the irreducibility of desire to states of pleasure, which only satisfy it in appearance, must be reaffirmed, it must be reaffirmed in another mode: transcendence. And this reaffirmation is the impossible jouissance-death relation. And from start to finish, it is the same conception. And when someone tells us: watch out, don’t confuse desire, pleasure, jouissance, obviously we shouldn’t confuse them because we need them to make the three arcs of the same circle, namely, the three arcs that bear down on desire.\n\nThe three maledictions are: You will lack every time you desire; you will only hope for discharges; you will pursue the impossible jouissance. Desire is thus completely ensnared, it is taken up in a circle.\n\nHow then is the problem of statements the same thing? It’s the same at the level of the Cartesian cogito, since you also construct your circle at the level of I walk, I breathe, I imagine, I see a unicorn, a system of statements in which the I [je] is the subject of the statement, and that is something like the appearance. Perhaps it’s not true, perhaps God is deceiving me, perhaps I believe I’m walking but I’m not walking. Second arc: but watch out, for if it’s true that I can be deceived when I say I’m walking, in return I cannot deceive myself when I say “I think I’m walking.” If it is true that I can be deceived when I say “I see a unicorn,” I cannot be deceived when I say “I think I’m seeing a unicorn.” That’s the extraction of the “I think, therefore I am,” it’s the extraction of the subject of enunciation; and the production of the statement, of any statement, is made in the form of a splitting of the subject into the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement, as the condition of the production of any possible statement.\n\nDesire-lack is found at the level of the splitting of the subject, of the cut, the bar. The desire-pleasure system is found at the level of the subject of the statement. And the desire-jouissance system is found at the level of the glory of the subject of enunciation, once again with the mystification of the circle: you will command all the more insofar as you obey, i.e., you will be all the more ready to be a true subject of enunciation insofar as you conform yourself to the bar that separates you as a subject of the statement from the subject of enunciation. In other words, it’s through castration that you accede to desire. To say: it’s through castration that you accede to desire, or to say: it’s through the splitting of the subject that you accede to the production of statements, is the same thing.\n\nRyjik: You don’t want to go further with Descartes’ God and Lacan’s signifier?\n\nDeleuze: I don’t want to, but I will, ouaf! ouaf! ouaf!\n\nThe problem becomes: supposing we say that only statements. . . that’s desire. Every desire is a statement, all statements are desires. If things are indeed like that, what we must give an account of is the system of appearance; then it goes without saying that Nietzsche was completely right, it’s truly a Platonic Christian system. And if that leads to psychoanalysis, it’s not by chance, because psychoanalysis is the thing that says to us, “Come here, lie down, you’re finally going to be able to speak in your name,” and which, at the same time, withdraws in advance all possible conditions for the production of statements, precisely because it has subordinated all production of statements to the splitting of the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement, i.e., you will command all the more insofar as you accept castration and you pursue the impossible jouissance.\n\nRichard III: It seems to me that desire-discharge is taken up again in Lacan in the form of metonymy, it’s not far — but this is only an intuition — from desire — aufhebung, and that finally the entire history of desire which is displaced, and which one never manages to get to, is the trajectory of the Phenomenology of Spirit, broadly speaking. With precisely this jouissance, as an impossible horizon, which would be absolute knowledge.\n\nGilles Deleuze: If you like, but there is no reason to privilege Hegel, because he is one of the multiple cases where desire is defined as lack, but in the pages just before those on the master and slave, everything passes through this circle: desire-lack, the illusion of pleasure, and desire-jouissance.\n\nRichard III: What’s really interesting is that if you tie desire to the field of the Other and to the treasure of the signifier, you truly have the process of Erinnerung. . .\n\nGilles Deleuze: Yes, it’s not by chance that Lacan passed through Hegel; he has suppressed his Hegelian texts . . .\n\nThe problem is that it will be necessary to explain the formation of this appearance: Under what conditions do statements appear to be produced by a subject which, as the producer of statements, would then necessarily be split into a subject of the statement and the subject of enunciation. And above all, what does that permit as a falling-back [rabattement]? These are things we have already done, you have two possible fallings-back: either the subject of enunciation — in any case, the splitting makes them fall back on each other — either the subject of enunciation will fall back on the subject of the statement, and that will be the Oedipal apparatus, or else the subject of the statement will be granted to the subject of enunciation, and that will be the paranoiac apparatus. The paranoiac is the subject of the statement that takes itself to be the subject of enunciation.\n\nI fear that there is no explanation that will make the formula any less dismal. The paranoiac is truly someone who establishes himself between everything that can be used as a sign in a network, or a system of networks, such that the sign refers to another sign. The sign no longer refers either to the earth, or to a body, or to a thing, the sign refers to another sign in a system of networks. Consequently, and at the same time, it is subsumed under a signifier. And this signifier is what represents it for another signifier, the subject, following a well-known formula, namely: the signifier is precisely the subject of enunciation. And the position of the paranoiac is very typical and very formidable, because he is both the person who doubts the most and the person who has the greatest power. Paranoia swarms in every direction: a sign here, oh, here’s another one, oh, but over there, etc. It’s not like that in all deliriums. Once again, a paranoiac is networks, and when he is taken in the networks, he doubts everything, he says to himself: perhaps I’m being deceived. As a subject of the statement, he is perpetually in a kind of doubt, but at the same time, he recuperates everything, and he recuperates a certitude, he is the distributor of signs, he is powerful and omnipotent to the degree that he leaps, he is unstable, at the level of the subject of enunciation, and the formula of the paranoiac is at the level: I have guessed in advance. He passes his time oscillating inside his network of signs.\n\nIt will be necessary to give an account of this production of an appearance. Once again, the appearance consists in this: statements would be produced by a subject thus split. How was this thing here able to produce that thing there? And this is the problem: How to say “me” [moi]? How to dare to say “me”? As soon as I say “me,” I situate myself both as a subject of the statement and a subject of enunciation. And whenever there is this cleavage, there’s all this rubbish [saloperie] that comes along with it. I mean, for example: “Me as a human being.” All social functions are constructed on that, all repressive functions are constructed on this cleavage: me as human being, you understand, but as a father, I must act! Me as human being, I’m on you side; but as a cop, I have to apply the law! As a cop, I have to apply the law, which means that I’m the subject of the statement. As a man, I understand you: that means I’m the subject of enunciation. I will be a legislator all the more insofar as I am a subject, you will be a subject all the more insofar as you are legislators, we all understand each other. . . . This is a way of saying: OK, we are all castrated, it works.\n\nWhat we were saying last week was: there are no individual statements, no statement can be produced by an individual. Our hypothesis was that what produces statements were machinic assemblages, or what amounts to the same thing, collective agents of enunciation — on the condition that we understand that collective does not mean peoples, but that it means, in whatever sense the term is taken: what must be called collective agents of enunciation are all multiplicities, whatever their nature. So that we must explain how machinic agents of enunciation effectively produce variable statements in such and such circumstances, and produce new types of statements; how these statements are necessarily desires; and how, within this production, the illusion of the subject is engendered, of a subject split into a subject of enunciation and a subject of the statement, who has the impression of producing statements which, in fact, are produced by machinic assemblages or by the multiplicities acting in him.\n\nWe have to see how all this happens. We have to pose the problem practically! We have to pose a series of oppositions, we have to make a table: how is a body without organs produced, the first production of the statement. I mean: if something, in given conditions, does not function as a body without organs, there is no surface on which to inscribe a statement. A body without organs is the surface of inscription for every statement or for every desire. Except there is not a single body without organs, there are as many as you like. It’s a thing to produce or fabricate. A body without organs does not preexist. Last time, I took the desert as a model, but on the condition that certain things take place on it. The desert is indeed a place or a surface for the production of statements. There are no statements linked to drugs that do not presuppose as prior the constitution of a body without organs. . . . whatever takes place on the order of the event, i.e., the statement or desire, the event is finally the very identity of the statement and of desire, whatever takes place implies the constitution of a body without organs. As long as you have not made your body without organs, alone, with someone else, with n people, nothing is possible, you have to find your own.\n\nIn the bad column, that of the false conception of desire, we’ll put the organism. Here, it would be necessary to show how a body without organs is formed on this organism, how there appears on it a probe head, a machinic point, and this machinic point is this instance of movement that will be found later in this or that assemblage. The body without organs, the desert, is fundamentally populated. The problem of the unconscious is not really that of generations, it is a problem of population, it is a matter of know how one populates. When [André] Green writes, don’t go too far, a schizophrenic is someone who has a father and mother like everybody else, it’s not true. [The reference to Green occurs earlier, in Anti-Oedipus, notably p. 305]\n\nI have here a text by an old schizo, it’s very beautiful, this text. It’s made up of tales: “I love to invent people, tribes, racial origins … and to imagine other behaviors, a thousand other ways of being. I have always had a complex for exploration, and I only like to count on very fantastic explorations. For example, my deserts are like diversions, desert-diversions, for whomever can imagine these strange simulators of [missing word], these kinds of oneiric songs. I let myself go; I have the tendency to put my guilty experiences on my characters, to mistreat them” — you see it is a matter of populating the desert — “to use mental cruelty against them, by provocation. I have the rage to imagine how that can work, a being in an extreme situation, after all, it’s a passion . . .” [tape inaudible]. In all these tales, it is solely a question of deserts populated with tribes: “I return from my tribes. As of today, I am the adoptive son of fifteen tribes, no more, no less. And they in turn are my adopted tribes, for I love each of them more than if I had been born into it.” [For this citation, unattributed, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 30] Over there, a child has the right to adopt another tribe. There are many renegade children, and they don’t feel exiled at all. But their true parents? What do you mean by their true parents? Their true progenitors, their parents, are first of all whomever the child recognizes as such, progenitors or adopted, that is to say, the tribes. One is a child of a population and not the child of a father or a mother. A schizo thinks like that.\n\nIn the other column, as opposed to assemblages of multiplicities, there is the theme of the subject of enunciation, the split subject as the source of dualisms. To the anti-Oedipal apparatus is opposed the Oedipal apparatus, or to the becoming inhuman, the becoming animal, is opposed the becoming human of the other column. To monism-pluralism is opposed the dualities that follow from the false conception of the statement. To desire or the thought-process is opposed the conception of desire-lack-pleasure-jouissance; just as the two statuses of the sign we looked at last time are opposed, namely, the sign gathered together in a network that subordinates it to the signifier, and on the contrary, the sign that sets to work on its own account, that frees itself from the hypothesis of the signifier and which is coupled with a particle or a system of particles, i.e., the sign-particle as opposed to the sign-signifier. It would be necessary to know what machinic point marks the maximum of deterritorialization on this body without organs; this history of the machinic point that will mark the currents of deterritorialization on the BwO seems to me to be very complicated. It is also necessary to see the machinic assemblages that flow from it, and then the becomings animal, or, what amounts to the same thing, the intensities. The deterritorialized intensities that crisscross [quadrillent] the body without organs. And in all this, the subject is, à la lettre, a nomadic particle which traverses all that, the lines of deterritorialization, the intensities. The problem of the genesis of the illusion is: What is going to fix the subject? At the same time, it will be turned into an organism, it will be submitted to the cogito, it will be fixed, its submission will be assured, by telling it: it’s you who produces statements.\n\nNext time, we’ll have to look at Carlos Casteneda’s book. [While Deleuze and Guattari cite several in A Thousand Plateaus, this first reference is likely to the first in the Don Juan series, The Teachings of Don Juan (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971] It recounts, broadly speaking, not an initiation, but truly an experimentation. The guy would indeed like to be initiated, because he’s a poor guy, and the Indian tells him no problem. Carlos says to him: teach me, I want to know, i.e., he treats the old Indian like one treats one’s psychoanalyst, and the Indian tells him: begin by finding your body without organs. Carlos’s search for his BwO is pathetic, he is looking in a restrained space, in a kind of desert, that’s the joyous experimentation; and in a certain way, this search is to find the place where one is at ease [la place où on est bien]. From a schizoanalytic perspective, the guy has to find where he is at ease, and in what position, if he wants to hang from the ceiling. . . . There’s no reason for him to lie down. And Carlos looks for his place by rolling around in the grass, he seeks until he finds. Once he’s found his place, he no longer lives as a subject, but as a tiny thing [truc], a tiny particle, and then there is a more brilliant particle, the Indian.\n\nThen, a machinic assemblage begins. In what form? In the form that it is necessary to have an ally. On the one hand, it is necessary to have a teacher, an experimenter, but it is also necessary to have a powerful ally. All this begins to make a little machine where something is going to happen; a certain distribution of intensities is already being drawn on this body without organs. And then he sees a dog, he plays at being dog [il fait le chien], but it’s not that either, he doesn’t play dog; he is in the process of undoing the organization of the body in favor of something else. One feels that the problem is not that of becoming animal; the dog is not a dog. The Indian says: that’s not a dog, it’s anything at all, whatever you like. What is this type of becoming inhuman, which is expressed badly in saying “he’s playing dog”? He has traversed certain intensities, which one can represent by: dog, as in Kafka. Kafka also plays dog, but he doesn’t need drugs to do so; he invented another machine for himself in order to do it. At the end, Carlos annoys the Indian so much that the Indian says to him, “But this dog, what, you take yourself for what? It’s not your whore of a mother.” That’s anti-psychoanalysis. This dog here is the outcome [sortie] of the Oedipal apparatus. He followed his body without organs, lines of deterritorialization following deterritorialized intensities.\n\nWhy these intensities rather than others? He’ll then become a lizard; then he’ll progress, he’ll become a crow. To play the crow [faire le corbeau] truly consists in making the legs and wings of the crow grow from his face, to be populated with crows. It was not to play dog, it was to be populated with dogs. To play dog, it is not enough to go “woof, woof, woof,” one has to pass through other experimentations. This changes everything in the problem of totemism.\n\nWhen structuralists speak of totemism, it’s rather poor, dry. Totemism has always had certain relations with the history of drugs, but it is not that at all, for in the second book, where the experimentation continues even more strongly, we witness the passage from becoming inhuman, from becoming intense to something yet again which is a kind of becoming molecular, as if the disorganisation of the organism in favor of a body living in another mode, again implying something more. And that’s clairvoyance. What does it mean to see inside? [Given the context, the reference is no doubt to Carlos Castaneda’s second book, A Separate Reality (1971)]\n\nThat consists above all in seeing water, and Carlos, through an entire series of stages, sees the water that is modified, hardened, immobilized, and which, above all, is dissociated. At the end, it is molecularized and he grasps the water through its constitutive bubbles; but he can’t grasp and see the water through the constitutive molecular bubbles except in connection [liaison] with what is produced by experimentation . . .

Stivale\n\nTranslated by Christian Kerslake\n\n… one would be engaging in a flattening operation. We’re starting from a point where what happens in a completely private way to an alcoholic or a drug user, or what happens to an army in an operation of conquest, or what happens to a historically assignable State, to social formations – we are going to consider all of that as if it were spread out on a plane of equivalence. From one plane to another, relations and networks are then woven, so that we better understand the difference between these planes. Thus, we can proceed by treating everything on the same plane: a guy in the process of [missing phrase], a nomad setting out to conquer something … No reason not to put that on the same screen, if there’s a point to it – because it’s certainly not the same thing – but in order to see what fabric can be woven between all that.\n\nWhy is this linked to the problem of the production of statements?\n\nLast time, I attempted to distinguish the kinds of strata which were produced on the body without organs and which inhibited, and which were even made to inhibit, the functioning of the body without organs.[1] I would like to start again from there. Everything happens as if the body without organs, once given, was prevented from functioning. All the same we have some ideas on how it functions. The body without organs can be anything: it can be a living body, it can be a place, it can be a land, anything you like. The body without organs designates a use.\n\nA body without organs being assumed, it always undergoes, that is why it is never given. What I call body without organs is a kind of limit that, in a logic of desire, we must land on, or one must approach to it. Yes, the best we can do is to approach it, because maybe if we did more than approach it or reach for it, then the body without organs would reverse itself and would brandish its death-face to us. It takes a lot of prudence to make oneself a body without organs; it takes a lot of prudence not to get blown up, patience is needed. In any case, all the more so, if it is a limit to approach prudently, that’s because in order to approach it, things have to be blown up.\n\nWe know that it is precisely through lines of flight that we manage to approach the body without organs. Flight from what? What are we running from? We’re starting to have ideas about that; and on the other hand, not all lines of flight are equally valid. And yet, once again, I will consider them at the beginning as equivalents: the drugged line of flight, the revolutionary line of flight, which, however, are completely different from each other. For the moment I’m not looking for how they are different, even if that ultimately becomes the problem: how they can both plug into each other and how they can be completely different. They do not put the same machines into play.\n\nWhat prevents the body without organs from functioning, and what makes it so that, for us, the body without organs is always to be fabricated, is that it undergoes all sorts of inhibitions. It is never given except through inhibitions that need to be blasted away. Everything happens as if it were caught in a triple bandage, and I would like to try to clearly situate the notions that correspond to this triple inhibitory bandage.\n\nThese bandages, we can just as well call them strata. As opposed to what? The stratum is almost like a kind of formation on the body without organs that will cause it to fall back on itself, to refold itself, to form one-to-one relationships. The body without organs taken in a stratum is folded, refolded, forms a falling back that produces one-to-one relationships, and it is these one-to-one relationships which prevent the functioning of the BwO (body without organs), because the BwO, if it manages to function, functions in the form of a regime of polyvocal connections. So that crimping it, imposing techniques which push it back down, so that it no longer functions through polyvocal relations – that is already to take away all chances from it. In other words, everything happens on the body without organs, both its inhibitions and its formation, its constitution, its fabrication.\n\nAnd so the three strata are rules through which the body without organs does not function, does not succeed in freeing itself. I think that they are opposed – I’m attempting to throw out a whole series of words here to see what sticks and what doesn’t – that they should be opposed to the body without organs itself, which is not stratified. And it is not stratified because it is the plane of consistency, or what comes down to the same thing, the field of immanence of desire. That means desire in its positivity, desire as process, and desire as process precisely can only be defined negatively on the basis of what betrays it.\n\nAnd we saw on previous occasions that the three great betrayals, the three maledictions on desire are: to relate desire to lack; to relate desire to pleasure, or to the orgasm – see [Wilhelm] Reich, fatal error; or to relate desire to enjoyment [jouissance]. The three theses are connected. To put lack into desire is to completely misrecognize the process. Once you have put lack into desire, you will only be able to measure the apparent fulfilments of desire with pleasure. Therefore, the reference to pleasure follows directly from desire-lack; and you can only relate it to a transcendence which is that of impossible enjoyment referring to castration and the split subject. That is to say that these three propositions form the same soiling of desire, the same way of cursing desire.\n\nOn the other hand, desire and the body without organs at the limit are the same thing, for the simple reason that the body without organs is the plane of consistency, the field of immanence of desire taken as process. This plane of consistency is beaten back down, prevented from functioning by the strata. Hence terminologically, I oppose – but once again if you can find better words, I’m not attached to these –, I oppose plane of consistency and the strata which precisely prevent desire from discovering its plane of consistency, and which will proceed to orient desire around lack, pleasure, and enjoyment, that is to say, they will form the repressive mystification of desire.\n\nSo, if I continue to spread everything out on the same plane, I say let’s look for examples where desire does indeed appear as a process unfolding itself on the body without organs taken as field of immanence or of consistency of desire. And here we could place the ancient Chinese warrior; and again, it is we Westerners who interpret the sexual practices of the ancient Chinese and Taoist Chinese, in any case, as a delay of enjoyment. You have to be a filthy European to understand Taoist techniques like that. It is, on the contrary, the extraction of desire from its pseudo-finality of pleasure in order to discover the immanence proper to desire in its belonging to a field of consistency. It is not at all to delay enjoyment.\n\nBut I could just as well point to, in our civilizations – look at those who have studied masochism – certain maso techniques, for example. The Chinese Tao, the Western maso, that too gets interpreted as bringing into operation phenomena of delay of enjoyment, whereas its operation is to discover a process immanent to desire, such that desire no longer relates to pleasure. The whole problem is precisely what, in Taoist China, appears as the absence of all perversion, as a desiring activity without perversion, the field of perversions being completely external to that. In our societies, at least in the case of the maso, the equivalent can only appear as perversion. It is obvious that the general economy of desire is not the same.\n\nSo there you have it, I start from this first great opposition: plane of consistency of desire of the body without organs and the strata which bind the body without organs. These strata, last time, I saw three of them.\n\nThe first stratum is that of organization. The stratum of organization is very simple: it consists in making the body without organs into an organism. And I use the word ‘make’ as in making a child[2]: one makes him an organism; one organizes him according to the principle of the yield of useful energies, of energies of work. One imposes on what happens on the BwO. What happens is very variable; the job is not over with the fabrication of a body without organs. On the contrary, it is not a scene, nor a place; the BwO is like a mastery, starting from which something will happen because something will be produced. The stratum of organization is entirely made to take what is on the point of happening, to take what is already happening on the body without organs, into a system which will direct all that in a completely different direction. It will divert it.\n\nAnd this system, which will precisely extract the useful energies – called useful as a function of social production, to inhibit so-called useless energies – well, this system is the articulatory relation or the double organic organization. And this double organic organization, which is truly at the basis of the constitution of the organism … the best example is muscle tone. You have to look at the theory of muscle tone found among biologists, and I’m thinking of an interesting theory proposed by [indistinct name], which shows that muscle tone is a statistical given.[3] And it’s interesting, because the way in which the fabrication of the organism proceeds, when one makes an organism out of the body without organs, comes down to saying that all the molecular phenomena which happen on the body without organs will be taken up into large ensembles known as statistical. And this is even the first level of the double articulation; they will be caught up in crowd [foules] phenomena, and this is going to be the first stage of the passage from the molecular dimension belonging to the body without organs – and the BwO is nothing other than a giant molecule.\n\nAnd these molecular phenomena will be organized into large organic molar ensembles of the skeleton type, and there, contemporary biologists show very well the extent to which the organism is a statistical given, that is to say implying a microbiology, namely implying the reduction of molecular, microbiological phenomena, to large statistical ensembles, or else, as for muscle tone – and this is related – the role of the nervous system in the molar constitution of organisms endowed with such a system.\n\nBut then this role of the nervous system also explains something else to us, namely that the organism in its relations with the external world is endowed with this strange faculty of representation, by which it annexes to itself a portion of the external world: the organism is not constituted as a form – what defines the form being precisely the double articulation – without apprehending external reality as a form which corresponds, not by resemblance, but according to relationships that biologists have tried to determine, namely [indistinct words]. And there is a whole derivation between the organic form itself, which we can call Form I, based on the double articulation, and the organization of the perceived world of representation, where the external world is grasped through the relay of the nervous system under the species of a form of another type, Form II: that’s [Raymond] Ruyer’s direction of research on the passage from the organic Form I to the Form II of perception.[4] So all that’s to do with the first stratum.\n\nAnd I say ‘first’ because one has to start somewhere; above all, one should not interpret it as chronologically first. Already the formation of the organism is very much connected to social pressures, and when I said it was in accordance with the principle of useful energy, that indeed calls upon a whole world of social production. So, I retain, for this first stratum of organization, a certain number of concepts which seem to me key: useful or useless energy, the articulatory relation or double organic articulation, muscle tone and the nervous system, and representation. We can call that the volume of organization.\n\nAnd then the second stratum will be the stratum of signification. And the stratum of signification, we could just as well say that it follows from the first, as that the first supposes it. And this time, we will no longer speak of the volume of the organism, but for reasons that we will see presently, we will speak of the angle of significance. It is this second stratum which prevents the body without organs as much from functioning as from being attained. And this time, its difference with the first is that the stratum of organization resulted in a world of representation distinct from reality, so that the great break which corresponded to the stratum of organization was – first rupture, the rupture of double articulation – and then it was just as much the rupture representation-real – [but now] the stratum of signification passes to the interior of representation and it also consists … this time, it’s a rupture that happens on the inside of representation, between what we will call the Signifier and the Signified. Therefore, this break is of a completely different type, and it consists in what? It consists first of all in a phenomenon of double articulation. This phenomenon of double articulation does not coincide with signifier-signified. Double articulation is constitutive of the signifier. It includes a first level which is also a certain way of forcing the molecular phenomena which occur on the BwO to enter into the large ensembles, large ensembles corresponding to statistical laws.\n\nOnly, this time, these molecular phenomena, they are what? At the level of representation, it’s what can be called, for convenience, figures of expression. And so at a first level of this articulation which is made within the framework of representation, the figures of expression are taken up into ensembles that constitute distinctive units. Distinctive units, among linguists, in their theory of representation in its relationship to speech, among linguists, these are called phonemes, or even more simply, one can call them letters, although this not the same thing.\n\nSo, the first level of representation which takes molecular phenomena into statistical ensembles is: the figures of expression are taken up into statistical units, units not yet significant but distinctive, that is to say which enter into relations of distinction with each other and which are called phonemes. The double articulation comes about because what are called phonemes (distinctive units) are in turn taken up into the statistical units of another type, this time significant or signifying units that one calls morphemes. There, the double articulation does not correspond to the duality signifier-signified; it is wholly at the basis of the constitution of the signifier. It is the signifier as such which implies double articulation, this time the double articulation of representation and no longer of the organism. There would already be here a whole problem consisting in seeing what the relationship is between the organic double articulation and the double articulation of representation.\n\nThus the figures of expression as molecular phenomena are organized into these two successive types of statistical units which constitute the signifier, that is to say, they are translated into phonemes and morphemes.\n\nAnd that’s why what seems to me very important in a linguist like [Louis] Hjelmslev is the way in which he goes beyond both the domain of morphemes and the domain of phonemes, in order to tell us a little something about the figures of expression in the free state, taken below what he himself calls the conditions of identity of phonemes. And he is perhaps the only one to have attained a kind of molecular linguistics, a micro-linguistics, and it’s very important and sad – but maybe that will improve – that Hjelmslev was as if crushed by the other currents of linguistics.[5]\n\nOnce you have this constitutive double articulation of the signifier, from that moment there is no longer much difficulty in generating the signified as the correlate of the signifier. So the double articulation bears on the engendering of the signifier and not on signifier-signified relations. The signified will be, roughly, the set of icons (notion of C.S. Peirce) which correspond to the signifying elements such as they are formed by the double articulation, the icons being images. And on the side of the signified-icons, just as earlier the signifier implied a double articulation imposed on the figures of expression, on the side of the signified, the icons here also suppose a kind of system in which are caught up, this time, not figures of expression, but figures of content. The imprisonment of figures of content in icons, in the signified, and the statistical treatment of figures of content so as to form icons, that is to say the set of images that correspond to the signifying elements, and then the parallel operation at the level of the figures of expression taken up into the double articulation phonemes-morphemes, all that combines very well.\n\nSimply, to finish with this level, with this second stratum, if I establish the signifier-signified line, therefore, with at one end the capture of figures of expression, at the other end the capture of figures of content, with the two poles I mentioned last time … For example, to be a bit less obscure here, it represents, if you like, at the level of the nursery school, the way in which one teaches children to draw, or when one teaches them to write; or, at the other pole, the nursery school lesson about things, in the forms of drawing or in the forms of graphism that one imposes on them – the figures of expression that are taken up into an imposed form, those which will function as the signifier; and the others as the signified, that is to say, the set of lessons of things, this is the signified which refers to the set of graphisms; that’s how it works in the classic nursery school.\n\nTherefore, in my line, I can say that the set of figures of expression led back to the signifier, caught in the net of the signifier, and which I represent by a sort of circle around the signifier – the set of figures of expression is thus reduced to a slavery, caught up in these units which impose upon them so that they no longer play freely, no longer enter into free connections. On the other side, I can make the circle of the signified where, this time, it will be the set of figures of content taken up in the system of lessons about things, equally enslaved and prevented from entering into free connections. We assume that these two circles have an intersection, and this intersection which is the very articulation signifier-signified, the articulation graphic form-lesson about things, it is this intersection of the two circles, the circle of the signifier and the circle of the signified, which constitutes what I called for convenience the dominant real.\n\nWhile the first stratum led to a representation-real break, the second stratum opens onto something quite different: a break interior to representation with a new phenomenon of double articulation which culminates with a duality which is no longer that of representation and the real but is what in the representation of the dominant real differs from what will have to be called a masked real. The masked real is what continues to work under the net of the signifier and under the net of the signified, namely the free connections between figures of expression and figures of content, treated in molecular manner, that is to say insofar as they are not taken up in systems of enslavement.\n\nAnd then, the third and last stratum – they follow from one another, but it would not be difficult to do the inverse procedure, of showing that III is already presupposed by II. And here, at the meeting point of the intersection, I would say the third stratum can be defined, namely the stratum of subjectivation, to which corresponds more precisely the point of subjectivation.[6]\n\nThe point of subjectivation is very curious, it must be very important, but I don’t quite yet see how. I would say that there is no dominant real without a point of subjectivation, and this point is not at all the point where the subject emerges. It is the point from which the angle of significance and the variable opening of this angle are organized. It is always starting from a point of subjectivation that the cut [découpage] of the dominant real is made, and it is always starting from the point of subjectivation that the machine of signification will come into play, and all the more, the machine of organization.\n\nThere is always – and it is in this sense that this third stratum is presupposed by the other two – there is no organization of an organism, there is no significance of significations, there is no determination of a dominant real, without a point of subjectivation which corresponds to it. It’s not at all that it’s the point of subjectivation which makes the dominant real. Strictly speaking, it measures it, it fixes its variable limits. Why variable? Because each of us evidently has several points of subjectivation; but the point of subjectivation is not what will fabricate the dominant real. It is what will permeate it, allowing us to rediscover ourselves there, to fix ourselves to such and such a place in the dominant real and to maintain ourselves, and to organize almost all our understanding and our resignation to the dominant real. Starting from the point of subjectivation, one has the impression that one understands everything, and that what belongs to the dominant real is there for eternity.\n\nIf I take someone, their points of subjectivation are very numerous and, ultimately, I ask myself – that would make things easier – if the point of subjectivation isn’t a new function. And it is through this that the third stratum flows from the second, if it is not a new function of the signified itself, that is to say, of icons. Last time, I said: we see how, once the dominant real has been assigned for someone, the dominant real, for example, let’s suppose, of a worker, this is where one can see the angle of significance of a resigned worker: it’s the factory, the job, the family. And then he will say: it’s always been like that, there will always be bosses, machines everywhere; all that is organized in a dominant real. The masked real is what is masked by the dominant real, namely the trafficking of the bosses, or the force or non-force of revolutionary groups who propose to blow up the dominant real, etc.\n\nBut the guy who is caught up in the dominant real, in the first case, he submits to it. That means that, in a certain way, he must fuse with the impression of understanding this dominant real. Now, I say that this is indeed the role of the point of subjectivation, which is not at all in him; the point of subjectivation is what will constitute him, as a subject fixed in such and such a place, but it is not the point of his subjectivity. The point of subjectivation is the point from which the angle of significance of the dominant real will narrow and will vary its opening, for example when the guy passes from his work to his family. The point of subjectivation assumes the “Get on, the boss said so”; the boss functions as an icon in a very special sense, that is to say, a point of subjectivation starting from which the description or assignation of a dominant real is made.\n\nAnd then, he gets home from work, he finds his wife, and I guess it’s not marvellous, he gives her his wages. His wife acts as another point of subjectivation. If he is a fetishist, his wife, as a global person, acts as a point of subjectivation sketching another dominant real in the dominant real. It’s not the same angle, but it overlaps. And then comes the moment of love, and he is a fetishist, so he loves his wife’s dress even more than his wife … a woman’s dress, or a woman’s shoe also forms a point of subjectivation. We pass our time jumping from one point of subjectivation to other points of subjectivation. But there is always a masked real.\n\nTypical case of a point of subjectivation: the chief.[7] The chief has said this: long live Hitler. There is the dominant real of Nazism and then the great icon, the figure of the chief who intervenes as a point of subjectivation starting from which each Nazi properly fuses with the dominant real which imposes some particular place on him in the corresponding society.\n\nWhat function do these three strata serve? It seems to me that this is where social formations function, namely the three great social orders are: you will be organized or otherwise you will be depraved; the second is: you will signify and you will be signified, you will interpret and you will be interpreted, or otherwise you will be a dangerous deviant; and you will be subjectivated, that is to say fixed, your place assigned, and you will only move if the point of subjectivation tells you to move, otherwise you will be a dangerous nomad. There is a dominant reality of work, there is a dominant real of labor; this dominant real does not have an invariable opening, it has a variable angle. This is what one will call the mobility of manpower. The mobility of manpower is brought about starting from a point of subjectivation specific to the capitalist formation, and which is the mobility of capital.\n\nAnd starting from the 19th century, one of the essential problems for political economy had been the comparative mobility of manpower, the mobility of the workforce in relation to the mobility of capital: how to make it so that there is no mobility of labor that would exceed the mobility of capital or which would be carried off in other directions. That would produce nomads. And how to make it so that the workers agree to go where the mobility of capital, that is to say, capitalist investment, goes? I would say that, under this aspect, capital taken in its mobility is the mobility of the point of subjectivation on which depends the mobility of a subject in the dominant real.\n\nTo the first stratum correspond the exclusions of the depraved, that is to say, those who make their organism function according to a principle of useless energies, that is to say, those who are not socially productive. And already, this depravity is a certain way in which someone has blown up the organism or the organization of the body in order to rediscover something of a body without organs, the BwO being essentially a captor of so-called useless energies. To the second stratum corresponds the exclusion of the experimenter, the experimenter being precisely the one who traces a domain of non-significance. And to the third stratum, correspond the exclusions of the nomad.\n\nWe must continue to spread everything out on the same plane, this whole system is connected, and this is the reason I’m fascinated by the text by [Antonin] Artaud, ‘To Have Done with the Judgment of God’, where he only describes the first stratum, namely how one makes the body into an organism, how one forces the body to take the form of an organism. Hence Artaud’s cries: “My body has been stolen”[8], that is to say: where I had a body as a living body, I have been made into an organism. Now in fact, it is this triple system of the three strata together which forms the judgment of God, that is to say the theological system. And what is profoundly connected there are the activity of organization, the activity of interpretation which corresponds to the stratum of signification, and the activity of subjectivation.\n\nAnd one can find them at all levels, that is to say, all regimes of organization imply this: once again, you will be organized and you will organize, you will be interpreted and you will interpret, you will be subjectivated and you will move as soon as someone tells you to. We find that everywhere, and we can even call the system of the judgment of God, or the despotic system, the totality of these three strata; or the imperial system. It is simply the forms that differ: in every system – and once again, for the moment, it is a matter of putting everything on the same plane – … Fascism: the problem would be: what is the type of organization, including the organization of properly fascist bodies, what is the properly fascist machine of interpretation and what are the points of subjectivization of fascism? And it will be necessary to seek that for every imperial formation.\n\nThe conjugal apparatus is similar. We must consider it in the same way. The conjugal relationship indeed implies a kind of organization of bodies which even has a whole jurisdiction, namely the belonging of bodies between spouses; a certain principle of useful energy, namely desire related to the lack; an angle of significance which constitutes the properly conjugal machine of interpretation with its dominant real: ah, my kitchen, ah, my children. This is the dominant real, and the point of subjectivization, which is often very variable, the point of subjectivation can be the husband, the husband as chief: my husband, that’s what he likes, I’m going to make him the dinner he likes this evening. There we have a point of subjectivation from which the dominant real is cut out. Or else it’s the kid who takes the role of the little boss [petit chef]; or maybe it’s the vacuum cleaner. You have infinite points of subjectivation, they form little constellations.\n\nWe should carry out inquiries into households; we would take several households, and we would fix their three strata: the organization of the body of the husband on the collective body, or its non-organization; then the stratum of significance; and then the stratum of subjectivation and the variations of points of subjectivation. One could analyze the imperial machine in these terms, or the [psycho-]analytic machine. From the moment there is a despotic formation, you always find the three strata that prevent the formation of a field of immanence of desire. This is why, at this level of analysis, I can consider everything, formally, structurally, everything as equivalent: whether it is the Nazi despotic machine, whether it is the conjugal machine, or whether it is the psychoanalytic machine. For the moment, it doesn’t matter about the differences.\n\nIn the case of the psychoanalytic machine, we can push the analysis further. First, what plays the role of the body without organs? There are always several bodies without organs nested one inside the others; there is never just one. What plays the role of a body without organs is first of all the cabinet of the analyst. Then the analyst, insofar as he does not listen or talk, is made to function as a body without organs. But it is a BwO which is necessarily trapped since it only functions as BwO in order to prevent the functioning of the body without organs, that is to say, in order to trace on the BwO strata which will allow phenomena from the body without organs to enter into the disciplinary units of the organization of significance and subjectivation.\n\nFirst question then: what is the analogue of a body without organs in psychoanalysis? Second question: how does the organization of strata get made in psychoanalysis, or in conjugality, or in fascism? There is also a fundamental organization, an organization of bodies which happens in psychoanalysis. Then we would have to look into – because it is very variable – we would have to interrogate the whole domain of the psychosomatic; or else it would vary with the types of illness, for example, in the case of hysteria. It is obvious that there is a very precise corporeal organization; and then – and this is the essential – in line with the formation of the different strata, it is now this or now that stratum that will have a privilege over the others.\n\nIn the psychoanalytic machine, the stratum which devours almost everything, at the limit, is the stratum of signification, that is to say, its norms of significance: whatever you do, it means something. Notice that that corresponds especially with the conjugal relation. It perhaps refers even more to the contemporary conjugal relationship than to the facts of childhood … [indistinct remarks]. In the conjugal relationship you have this interpretation machine: ‘What did he do?’ What does that mean, ‘What did he do?’, this machine where everything means something: ‘Wait, he does not like his soup today, what’s happened?’ That’s the exclusion of all right to a-significance. Everything has a signification, and we can no longer do anything a-signifying. That’s the interpretation machine; it’s no one’s fault, that’s what the thing is made for.\n\nAnd then there are points of subjectivation. There was the point of subjectivation of the childhood type: it was starting from childhood that the dominant real was determined, such as it was traced through the cabinet of the analyst, and that helps explain why this thing is truly a drug. How does analysis become, literally, their dominant real? Why do they end up organizing their entire schedule from one session to the next, so that everything depends on the next session? What’s going to happen next time? What will happen in the next session? What happened in the last session? … It’s really like any despotic machine, the alignment of a dominant reality in which one is subjectivated.\n\nSo, childhood was for a long time the psychoanalytical point of subjectivation, but now, with guys like [Serge] Leclaire or [indistinct name], there’s no longer even any need for childhood. They discover an even more artificial, even more perverse, point of subjectivation, no longer the childhood scene, but the analytic scene in the closed cabinet of the analyst.[9] It is a displacement of the point of psychoanalytic subjectivation that is very important: the psychoanalyst is no longer valid as the representative of the father and the mother, but is valid through himself, like a master of an axiomatic or of an accounting of desire, the truth of desire no longer referring to a childhood reality, but referring to what happens in the cabinet.\n\nSo, with regard to the whole system, we can do this analysis to show how a body without organs is there as a field of immanence of desire, and at the same time is completely prevented from functioning by the organization of strata, that is to say, by the organization of the volume of the organism, of the angle of significance and the points of subjectivation.\n\nThat is the first point that I wanted to take up. All the same, that gives us a set of concepts that leads to an evident conclusion: in our enterprise of seeking the body without organs, in a certain way, I can say that it is always there, whether you make it or not, it is always there. It’s simply that if you don’t take the trouble to take it into your own hands and to make it yourself, it is done to you, and it is done to you in accordance with the strata that prevent it from functioning. At that moment, you are taken up into the system of organization, of significance and subjectivation. In any case, it is there.\n\nSo, what to do? To make oneself a body without organs, what can that mean, since in any case, there already is one.[10] It means something very simple: to make one which is destratified. To make one which functions. And to make one which functions, what does that mean? It means, by all the evidence, to make one that has broken its triple bandage, its triple link, its three strata, that is to say, to make one which, in a certain manner, has broken with the organization of the organism; which, in another way, has broken with the angle of significance; and which, in yet another way, is desubjectivated, that is to say, a body which is discretely – I’ll explain later what I mean by ‘discretely’ –, the most discrete, the most depraved, or the most disorganized, a-signifying and desubjectivated.\n\nAll that obviously refers to what happens on the body without organs, and this time, I’m only defining it negatively. These are very practical tasks: kill the interpretation in yourself. The machine of interpretation is the manipulation of the angle of significance. When I say that it is necessary to be prudent, that comes down to saying that the constant danger, at the limit – I’m dramatizing a little – is death. It’s because of that that the psychoanalysts, for example, do not abandon the death instinct. In their incapacity to understand that the body without organs is the life of desire in the raw state, in the pure state, it is desire in its plane of consistency, in its field of immanence, because they have identified life with this artificial pseudo-life of organization, signification and subjectivation; and in the face of any attempt to blow up these three strata, they will say: this is the death drive; and in fact, it can be that.\n\nAt random, I’ll take the examples we’ve got: the drugged body.[11] It’s quite obvious that, in a certain way, it is a body that rediscovers itself as a body without organs; that is to say that it – in one way or another, depending on the type of drug, it will not be in the same way – blows up the stratum of organization. The maso: that’s the key perversion, because a perversion, like fetishism, seems to me to be completely inscribed in the domain of strata. There is something very cunning in fetishism, it’s that there is such a mobility to the point of subjectivation, or such a derision, where the point of subjectivation being taken as a partial object, the fetishist makes use of the point of subjectivation in such a cunning manner, that his way of using it amounts to a way of suppressing it, even if he still passes through the point of subjectivation. But take as examples the drugged body or the maso body: these are ways of blowing up – even if, as you say, only for a certain time and artificially –, the organization of the organism in order to rediscover a body without organs.\n\nThe second completely complementary attempt is no longer to blow up the organism for a certain time and artificially, but to kill in oneself (and if possible in others) the machine of interpretation: which is experimentation. To kill the interpretation machine; otherwise, you’re fucked, you’re already caught up in a despotic regime of the sign where sign eternally refers to sign, and where you can no longer have done with anything. Psychoanalysis is only the most perfect of the interpretation machines in the capitalist system. But there are others, and better known ones: religions, for example, in other social formations, are great machines of significance or of interpretation; and there is even a religious use of drugs. It should be said that we are never saved by anything.\n\nThere are even two dangers, that’s why I say patience and prudence are always necessary. After all and once again, according to the principle of experimentation, nobody ever knows in advance what is suitable for him; it takes a really long time to know. So fine, a guy can throw himself into drugs, and then it turns out it’s not his thing, but he thinks it is his thing. A guy can throw himself into drugs in such a way that he gets completely wasted. Well, that’s death, it’s the death drive like the psychoanalysts say.\n\nTo arrive at no longer interpreting, to arrive at what is so moving … For example, the machine of interpretation in the conjugal relationship is constantly nourished in the love relationship, because when I say conjugal relationship, it is not a question of husband and wife. It is not enough to not be married to not have conjugal relations. The MLF [Mouvement de Libération des Femmes] is full of conjugal relationships; the FHAR [Front homosexuel d’action révolutionnaire] is full of conjugal relationships; free communities secrete the conjugal relationship. I use ‘conjugal relationships’ exactly as a synonym for the relation of interpretation or the signifying relation where each asks themselves about the other: “He just said that, what do I think that he thinks that I think? etc.”: at the end of the day, exactly what Laing nicely called ‘knots’.[12] From the moment there is a knot, there is an angle of significance, something to interpret. “You’re in a bad mood, you’ve got that pinched look at the corner of your mouth, why are you in a bad mood?” “No, no, I’m not in a bad mood …”\n\nOnce again, the peak of interpretation is when the psychoanalyst does not say a word. This is the very height of interpretation. The guy leaves saying: “what a great session today.” Someone told me that there are subjects like that in analysis who go for a month, sixth months, two years, without the analyst saying a word, and it’s obviously because the synthesis of signification is empty, he does not need to add anything to what he synthesizes. It is an empty synthesis, a formal synthesis where the sign, instead of coupling with the thing and working on a thing, the sign refers to another sign. No need to say anything; at the limit, in the conjugal relationship, everything can be done by glances.\n\nThere are two kinds of people who are wrong: those who say that the real battle is on the outside; the people who say that are the traditional Marxists: in order to change man, let’s change the external world. And then there are the priests or the moralists who say: the real battle is on the inside: let us change man. Bizarrely, in a completely different way, certain Maoist depositions have taken up certain themes of this need to change man. What does that mean: let’s change man first of all, the struggle must be interior first of all? Many Americans have said that as well. What they mean when they are fully moralists and fully priests, is: the battle on the outside is not necessary; the battle on the inside is the deepest, and the battle on the inside is not the same as the pseudo-battle on the outside, which must be given up. The battle on the inside is against our egoism, against our vices; it is against our temptations, that is to say, it makes the three strata function.\n\nFor my part, I would like to say something completely different. I mean: the battle on the inside, I understand very well what that means; anyway I think so. It should just be said that the battle on the inside and the battle on the outside concern the same things. Institutions crystallized on the inside and internal secretions within me: these are the same things. So that a battle is indeed necessary, but a perpetual battle, a constant combat over the fact … [indistinct sentences] … The conjugal relationship is crystallized in institutions that have a certain power, but at the same time it is an internal secretion. Even if you don’t get married, you participate in conjugality from the moment you make interpretations, from the moment you make signification.\n\nWe have to constantly defeat this kind of gland which is in us and which produces interpretation in correspondence with the significations crystallized on the outside. It is at the same time that there is a whole system, a whole code of the signifier on the outside, and a whole gland of interpretation inside us. The battle against jealousy, for example. Some might well say – and they are partly right – “Well, I don’t feel jealous”. It doesn’t stop us saying at some kink in the path, “Woah, shit, how do I feel about that?” We had a gland which, in a less abundant form than others, had spread and confected jealousy. We weren’t aware of it, and then, at some moment, it’s too late: we were doing nothing but that.\n\nThe Oedipus complex is an objective institution crystallized in society in the form of human sex acts and rules of marriage; and it also completely governs the parent-child relationship. But it is also completely a gland of internal secretion; Oedipus is part of the conjugal relationship: think of conjugal relationships without children, the obscure sadness; there is always one member of the couple who becomes the other’s child, who is mothered by the other.\n\nIt is exactly the same revolutionary fight we have to engage with on the outside and on the inside. Once again, how many revolutionaries think it’s enough … – I insist on this because this is how I save myself from moralism; I am not saying there’s a battle on the inside which is of a different nature to the battle on the outside, I’m saying there is a single and same battle. It is strictly the same because fascism, that too is outside us and inside us – how many revolutionary militants are there who treat their wife as not even a bourgeois has ever treated his wife? How many are there who secrete conjugality to the point of shame? How many are there even among the most courageous militants of the MLF, who secrete mothering and interpretation, making the MLF the opposite of what a revolutionary group must be, that is to say, instead of being a group for experimentation, it has become a group for interpretation.\n\nI will take an example which seems quite fascinating to me, the possibility of a political struggle against the conjugal relationship, against the Oedipal relationship, and I say each time, since it is a question of detonating the strata which prevent us from acceding to the field of immanence, to the plane of consistency of desire – once again, it is necessary to proceed with caution: look at the difference between a drug user who gets completely wasted and a drug user who knows how to handle his stuff. That seems to me to be the art of experimentation. Experimentation implies prudence; the risk is obviously the opposite of destratifying, the risk of suicide. That comes partly from treating the battle solely as a battle against the outside. If we don’t know that Oedipus, fascism, the little chief, is also in us – and again, we see revolutionaries who are right little bosses at the very moment they are leading the external battle against the little bosses, against the factory foremen –, there once again you have a slippage. They don’t lead the way in internal experimentation in the same way as they lead the way in external experimentation. Here I believe it’s truly a single and same battle, which we can’t get out of, whichever stratum we want to detonate.\n\nAnd the most dangerous, the most deadly, are attempts to undo something of the experimentation of the body, of the organization of the body into the organism. To become disorganized, meticulously to [word not clear] … literally a higher life, or what Nietzsche called the great Health, to undo signification and interpretations, not in order to become some kind of moron, but in order to conduct real experimentation, that is to say to become an experimenter, and finally to become a nomad even in the place one is, that is to say to undo the points of subjectivation; all that is extremely difficult. It is not enough to get the hell out to become nomadic; it is not enough to cease to interpret in order to become an experimenter; and above all it is not enough to disorganize the organism to become a body without organs with things happening on it. Every time, it can be death, above all when you are no longer supported by the strata. And the strata function as bandages, in a certain sense; they prevent you from breaking up.\n\nWhat always fascinates me is the coexistence of the two, of the types, the way in which the types rub shoulders the whole time – the possible breaking up and then the experimentation. So that if one does not tread very carefully – see Castaneda … And in all these attempts, there is a fear, and there is every reason to have fear, not only at the most obvious level of disorganization, but even at the level of desubjectivation. It’s because the anchoring points from the point of subjectivation are very precious to you; when there are no longer any anchoring points a kind of anxiety starts up; there are all sorts of formations of anxiety which correspond to defection from the strata.[13]\n\nThere, I’ve talked about a whole bunch of notions, and I would like you to complete them.\n\nA student: I had the impression that you conceived the drugged body as something external; in fact, I think that, by definition, every body is drugged from the beginning. It would be necessary to look at the different kinds of drugs …\n\nDeleuze: If you give that extension to the word drugs, there are two kinds of drug use: the machine of interpretation, psychoanalysis, that’s a drug; the conjugal relationship is a drug; and these are drugs whose use is specifically in conformity with stratifications … [Interruption of the recording]\n\nRichard [Pinhas]: You didn’t dwell that much on what constituted the masked real, and I was wondering if, in relation to the dominant real, at the level of the productive assemblages of statements, one could not propose the hypothesis that, corresponding to this double approach dominant real – masked real, there might be at the level of statements also a double approach. Namely: already constituted statements which are always the repetition of structures, or of relays, of networks which are those, roughly speaking, of domination, of signifying effects which reproduce the law, the law in the sense of domination; and on the other side, at the other pole, points, event-based particles that one could call enunciations, as opposed to statements already in place, already constituted and bringing repetition; enunciations which, by virtue of nothing other than their innovative nature, experimental if you like, already explode, just by their presence, certain relays, certain networks of already constituted statements.\n\nDeleuze: Okay, yes, okay; I haven’t yet spoken of the masked real, because the masked real is precisely what happens on the body without organs when it is destratified. The dominant real is what masks the masked real, exactly in the same way as it takes up phenomena proper to the body without organs into statistical ensembles.\n\nWhat interested me was a study on muscle tone, a study of the tonus as biological given. Or do you see other strata, then? For my part, I don’t see any others; very broadly speaking, it seemed to me that there are the three great ones, and they are linked together: I will make you an organism, I will make you an interpreter, and I will subjectivate you. That is the theological system. What remains for us to see is what happens on the body without organs, underneath the strata, and each time, it will be necessary to show how it is the inverse side of the strata.\n\nSo, at the same time as the body without organs destratifies itself, things happen on it, it’s contemporary. What order of things, and how are they opposed to strata? I am just going to make a kind of list of things which happen on the body without organs. First, distributions of intensities; the body without organs from this point of view is truly intensity = 0, but taken as matrix of all intensities or the principle of all productions of intensities.[14] So that what happens on the body without organs is a distribution of intensities, and in this sense, the BwO is not only matrix of production of intensities, it is also a map of distribution of intensities.\n\nAnd yet ‘map of distribution’ is poorly put, and the less poorly put it is, the better it works, because map, that indicates something spatial, and the body without organs is not space, it belongs to matter insofar as it fills space according to such and such a degree of intensity, that is to say, according to the degree of the intensities which pass on it. Here there is already a whole domain: the intensities distributed on the body without organs. Now, the intensities are opposed, in the stratum of the organism, they are opposed to the world of representation. Intensities are fundamentally non-representative, they represent nothing, and it is in this sense that they will be a fundamental element in the machine of experimentation, as opposed to the machine of interpretation. I am restituting intensities as fundamental.\n\nThe second thing that transpires, and it is perhaps the same thing, is multiplicities. I say that it is perhaps the same thing because these multiplicities which are produced on the body without organs are precisely intensive multiplicities, and multiplicity belongs fundamentally to intensity. In what sense? In a very precise sense, namely that it is necessary to call intensive quantity any multiplicity that is apprehended in the instant. From the moment there is a multiplicity apprehended as multiplicity in an instant, there is intensive quantity. In the domain of extension, it is the opposite. What is apprehended in an instant is thereby posited as unity, and multiplicity can only be apprehended successively.\n\nIf it is true that intensities are opposed to the world of representation at the level of the strata, multiplicities are slightly different. They are opposed to extensive quantities or to qualitative forms which also in turn make up part of the strata at several levels, as much of the stratum of organization as of the stratum of signification. We have seen that one type of fundamental intensive multiplicity was a multiplicity that one could call a pack, as opposed to the extensive multiplicities of mass. The extensive multiplicities of mass are rather on the side of the strata, and the intensive multiplicities of packs are rather on the side of the body without organs and of its liberation with regard to the strata.\n\nThird thing which happens on the body without organs: these are the flows. And again, this is another way of saying the same thing; why? Flows are not the same thing as intensive quantities, but intensive quantities are always measures of flow. And it is not surprising because intensive quantities, being themselves multiplicities, multiplicities being themselves intensive quantities, intensities being themselves multiplicities, an intensity, that does not mean anything by itself, it does not mean anything. An intensity can only signify a difference of intensity, a difference between a maximum and a minimum, between a higher intensity and a lower intensity, beyond the putting in relation of two intensities under the conditions of their being put in relation.\n\nAnd there, that’s a whole problem, to know under what physical, aetiological conditions intensities enter into a relation, because supposing that the intensities enter into relation on the basis of a constitutive inequality, because they are completely unequal, and it is relations of inequality that define the difference of intensities, something happens, something flows which is precisely a flow from one intensity to the other, and the direction of the flow is determined by the passage from the highest to the lowest, or can be determined as being either in the direction of entropy, or in the direction of negentropy.\n\nFourth determination – but you have to sense that it’s the same thing; all that, it’s aspects of the same thing – free machinic connections, the whole domain of machinic connections, in opposing free connections to two kinds of other connections or relations: mechanical relations or finalist relations. For mechanical relations and relations of finality are constitutive of the organism. On the contrary, the domain of machinic connections, when two things make machines out of each other … One could pose this problem: under what conditions can two things, two beings or any two things whatever be said to form a machinic connection: what is necessary and under which circumstances are such connections formed? – but that’s not a part of the problems that remain to us. In any case, these machinic connections which are assumed to happen on the body without organs constitute precisely the whole domain of machines it is necessary to call a-signifying: they do not mean anything; they are defined uniquely by their use, their functioning, that’s all; they are not the object of interpretations, any more than intensities are objects of interpretation. The fourth domain is that of a-signifying machines.\n\nThese a-signifying machines are particularly connected to a regime that I called for convenience sake the sign-particle regime, and this is opposed to the strata since the strata, at least the second one, the stratum of significance, implies a completely different regime of sign, the regime of the sign under the signifier, and from the beginning I have attempted to oppose the regime of the sign-particle to the regime where sign refers to sign to infinity, under a signifier which constitutes the machine of interpretation. On the contrary, the machine of experimentation on the body without organs is the sign-particle couple.\n\nSixth possible determination of what happens on the body without organs, as opposed to the strata: it would be necessary to say that the strata define territories or processes of reterritorialization. What happens on the BwO, and this is why the BwO as intensive matrix is a desert, the desert not being at all something empty and depopulated, but being precisely the place inhabited by intensive multiplicities, by a pack, it is the place of packs … What happens on the BwO at this level, as opposed to the territorialities, are lines of deterritorialization. [End of the recording and of the session]\n\nNotes\n\n[1] The session referred to was presumably not recorded.\n\n[2] Faire un enfant is a common French expression for ‘to have a baby’, or ‘to have a child’.\n\n[3] Although the identity of the biologist and the study in question are unknown, the topic is framed here in a way that is consistent with the ideas from Raymond Ruyer, who is mentioned by name at the end of this section on the ‘stratum of organization’ (see footnote 4).

Stivale\n\nTranslated by Christian Kerslake\n\nLast time we were seeking, at very insignificant levels, how types of body without organs could be constituted and what might happen on a body without organs, once it is said that the body without organs is something which is to be made.[1] We saw that what happened on a body without organs was all sorts of things: multiplicities, flows, figures of content, figures of expression, and all that entered into relationships that formed machinic assemblages. Now all of this was directly our problem, namely: what produces statements? And in the insignificant examples we found last time, the statements in question could be, for example, the statements of alcoholics, or statements of perversion, or schizo statements; and I was quite clear that at this stage of research, there was no reason to make a difference in nature between a great statement of the schizo type, or a military statement for example, an imperial statement, or an alcoholic statement. This was the problem of statements, which implied that statements must be considered in the mechanism of their production, independently of their content and of the importance of this content.\n\nThere has been a presupposition which has been there the whole of this year, namely: what produces statements is never a subject; they are collective agents of enunciation, they are machinic assemblages – again, not at all calling on ‘social factors’, but calling on collective agents or collective assemblages [agencements] of multiplicities which pass through us, which are neither interior nor exterior to us, but which are indeed productive of the statements that we form.\n\nI would like to begin with a first remark. Our attempt here is neither attached to Marxism nor to Freudo-Marxism. With regard to Marxism, I’m not even looking for the details, I would say that there are three big differences. The first difference is that Marxism poses problems in terms of need. On the contrary, our problem was posed in terms of desires. There is a great practical difference: from the moment that problems are posed in terms of need, what is invoked is ultimately an authority [instance] supposed to be judge, both of the nature of these needs and of their distribution, and of the measure of their satisfaction. To pose problems in terms of needs is already to make appeal, I think, to what will reveal itself to be a party organization. On the contrary, to speak in terms of desires is to say that, not the subject, because there is perhaps no subject of desire, but that the instance of desire is the sole judge of the desires of which it is the bearer, whether it is an individual or a group; and in this sense the whole problem is displaced: not that there is no place for thinking about a centralization or about a connection between apparatuses of desire, but what is certain is that the connection between apparatuses of desire cannot be made under the form of a party apparatus which would play a decisive role. I believe that the position of a problem in terms of needs and in terms of desire is absolutely different.\n\nThe second difference is that Marxism supports a certain opposition between the economic infrastructure and the ideological, between the infrastructure as instance of production and ideology. For us, at no time did the problem of ideology arise, because we have a simple idea: it is not so much that ideology is in itself a deformation of something or transformation of something; it is not at all that ideology is, for example, a false consciousness; but that, literally, there is no ideology. It does not exist.\n\nThere is no ideology. There are only organizations of power; and what one calls ideologies are the statements of organizations of power. For example, there is no Christian ideology; there is on the other hand … fundamentally, Christianity, throughout its entire history, is not an organization of power of one particular type, but its history has been traversed by the invention of a multiplicity, of a variety of organizations of power, right up to the formation of the primary one, the idea of an international power; and what one calls Christian ideology, or the history of Christian ideology, is only the succession of statements corresponding to the organization of ecclesiastical power.\n\nIn the same way, I think there is no ideology of education, and to carry out a critique of the ideology of education is to fall into a false problem. Education must be thought starting from a type of organization of power exerted on children, and ideology, there too, is only the statement corresponding to the organization of power [indistinct word]. And perhaps if Marxism, under its traditional form, insists so much on a kind of duality between infrastructure and ideology, it was all the better to hide something which organized itself in it, namely the organization of power around a centralizing party, and the whole dualism and the whole Marxist reflection on the economy … Ideology has this role of mask in relation to the organization of power; already at the time of Marx and the International, then with Lenin, then in Stalin’s time, etc.\n\nThe third difference is, I believe, that Marxism carries out its work in a kind of movement which is at the same time that of recapitulation, or of a kind of recollection of memory, or of a kind of development: development of the productive forces. Our point of view is completely different: we conceive the production of statements, not at all under the species of a development, of a recollection of memory, but on the contrary, starting from a power which is that of forgetting, starting from a force which is that of experimentation, and starting from this experimentation insofar as it operates in non-development.\n\nI think it’s these three practical differences which mean that our problem has never been that of a return to Marx. Much more, our problem is much more forgetting, including the forgetting of Marx. But in the forgetting, little fragments float. I would also say why such an attempt can in no way participate in any tendency that could be qualified as Freudo-Marxism; and in this respect, it seems to me that there are two essential reasons why, speaking for myself, I would feel absolutely alien to every venture of Freudo-Marxism …\n\nThe first is that the Freudo-Marxist attempts are also made from a kind of appeal to memory, and to returning, whatever the complexity of the return: it’s about going back to Freud (the École freudienne[2]), it’s about a return to Marx (Althusser); even if the Marx that emerges is singularly original, even if the Freud that emerges is original, that does not prevent such attempts, which start through a return, seeming to be easy to define to me: it’s about, at that moment, saving the machine.\n\nIt seems obvious that the return to Freud, such as it has been carried out at the École freudienne, has allowed for the plugging of breaches in the psychoanalytic apparatus. The ‘epistemological’ return[3] has played out in order to save, in a certain way, the bureaucratic apparatus of psychoanalysis. The return to Marx, that was the same thing: saving the bureaucratic apparatus of the party, giving to this apparatus the guarantee of a return to [missing text]. The task for us would be to consider these bureaucratic apparatuses, both psychoanalytic and communist, to consider them in their current situation where, after a long period of misunderstanding, they are once more forging an alliance; to carry as far as possible the critique of these apparatuses such as they are – which excludes any return to Marx, any return to Freud.\n\nThe second reason is that all the Freudo-Marxist attempts consist in seeking the reconciliations between two lines of economy: a well-known economy that goes under the name of political, and an economy that would be libidinal, desiring, pulsional.[4] From the moment that one seeks such a reconciliation, the only thing one can expect of such an attempt is some kind of symbolization or some species of parallelism. A parallelism between the two economies, or a point on which one of these economies would be plugged onto the other, or a point on which one of these economies would detach itself from the other, etc. In other words, every Freudo-Marxist attempt is marked as a function of its starting-point by a dualism in which one will end up invoking parallelist themes as feeble, as lamentable, as symbolic equivalents, as parallelisms like money = shit, etc. It seems to me that everything that comes from Freudo-Marxism, as much on the side of [Wilhelm] Reich as with [Herbert] Marcuse, verifies this weakness.\n\nWe, on the contrary, our starting point is very simple: there is and there has only ever been a single economy, and it is the same economy which is fundamentally, from the beginning, at once desiring or libidinal and political. We consider the three following terms as close synonyms: position of desire, production of the unconscious, production of statements. This obviously implies, as much vis-à-vis Marxism as with psychoanalysis, a certain point of view which is foreign to both. Whatever one does, psychoanalysis always considers the unconscious as already produced, and as something to be reduced by a machine of experimentation, and an experimentation that is not only individual, but an experimentation which surely can be collective, in the sense that revolutions are discharges of the unconscious, are productions of the unconscious – and in this sense, they are perhaps the key to the domain of what we have been calling experimentation.\n\nAny system made to prevent the production of the unconscious is at the same time a system made to prevent the production of new statements, or a system made to prevent the positing of desire, in a place and in a time, as it produces itself. The production of statements must no longer fundamentally belong to a split which would put production on the side of an economic infrastructure, and frame statements from the point of view of a science or an ideology; rather the production of statements must truly constitute a part of the very sphere of production. What makes a posing of desire possible, or what makes the production of new statements possible? I could just as well ask, for it is the same problem: how does one prevent a statement from spreading, how does one avoid getting stuck in a rut with a statement, it comes down to the same thing as saying: how to produce new statements? How to ensure that a statement does not crystallize, so that a statement does not enter into the imperialist system that is the imperialist system of the sign under the signifier? That is a whole bloc of problems. It amounts just as well to saying: how to pose a desire in a group or in an individual, how to produce the unconscious?\n\nWe have seen in what sense the body without organs was the object of a production and how, starting from it, all sorts of things were produced. The underlying idea we had was that what was produced on the body without organs was the assemblage, a kind of assemblage proper to the posing of desire, to releasing the charges of unconscious, to producing an unconscious which is never already there, or to producing new statements. And after all, a historical break is defined by all sorts of things, but among others, by a production of statements.\n\nAre there any questions or comments before continuing?\n\nHenri Gobard: I would like to know if you have considered the problem of the transition from oral to writing, and ask you if, in fact, the condition of imperialism was not linked to transcription, to writing itself, because in an oral world, it would be much more difficult.\n\nDeleuze: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. yes. In a way, I want to answer yes and no. We looked at the role of writing in an imperial system last year; what interests me more is an idea that appears in [Louis] Hjelmslev: there is a point of view where that no longer matters, that is to say where there is an indifference of the substance.[5] Ultimately, he says, the substance is phonic, whether it is oral, whether it is written, or something else, whether it is coded in the form, for example, of semaphore language, morse language, it doesn’t matter that much. There is a point where you are completely right, and that’s in the history of social formations; and then, there is a point where ultimately almost the same machinic assemblage can bear on completely indifferent substances. The difference would intervene at the level of qualified flows: it is obvious that the oral flow and the flow of writing are not the same thing. But at the level of the machinic assemblage which, in a certain manner – but obviously it’s not the same level – if one assumes a machinic assemblage at a given period, bearing on any flows whatever, it will be the same one (with differences of intensities) that will seize hold of the oral phonic substance, written substance, and every other kind of substance. We can come back to that.\n\nIdeology is, literally, the system of statements which correspond to – not at all which hide –  some organization of power. Ideology absolutely does not consist in deceiving people; ideology is just the system of statements that flow from an organization of power such as it is: for example, between the Reformation and Catholicism, the problem is one of organizations of power, and we must not only take into account the struggle Reformation/Catholicism, we also have to take into account the settling of accounts at work within the Reformation, between statements of the popular type and the liquidation of the Reformist left, the conciliation with the princes of other reformed [countries], that is to say, what produced a type of organization of new power; and on the side of Catholicism, equally, we must take account of the whole system of heresies evidently implied by the discussions on the Trinity, putting into play very directly and very profoundly problems of organization of power concerning the Church. And it doesn’t even mask anything: it could only be stated like that.\n\nIdeology absolutely does not seem to me something deceptive at all: the most beautiful discussions in the Middle Ages on Scholasticism, on the Trinity – all that articulates very clearly and very clearly puts into play what the organization of the church is going to be, what the role of priest is going to be, it does not hide anything.\n\nGobard: I am very happy that you say it does not hide anything, because that corroborates my own research, namely that what is true is not the depth, it is the surface; you have to trust appearances.\n\nDeleuze: A statement is what is said. At our level, there is never anything to interpret.\n\nA student: [Question on need]\n\nDeleuze: You are asking me to theoretically justify how need and authority [instance], judge of needs, are connected; I can do that. I think that in the idea of need, there is fundamentally the idea of a lack of something, and that, from the moment something is lacking, there is necessarily a judge who will evaluate both the lack and the relation of what is lacking with the lack itself, that is to say, with the need; from that moment there is a whole system of organization of power; so the subject of need will be divested, and this is why socialist systems have the most often spoken in terms of need and not in terms of desire. Need is something in which lack is inscribed. And if desire is a process, then it is obvious that only the group as bearer of desire, or only the individual as bearer of desire, is judge of its own desire.\n\nWhen society brings about the repression of desire, it is always in the name of: people have needs, and we are charged with satisfying them. The repression of desire is never done in the name of: there are desires, you have to take them into account, but be reasonable; it’s always done in the name of need. When there is a conception of desire according to which desire would be a lack of something, it’s all well and good establishing the most severe distinction of nature between need and desire, these distinctions of nature are only words. We will see a certain theoretical shoring up where desire begins because it is lack of a lack, because it is lack to the second degree, as opposed to need. In any case, it will already have been pushed back into the domain of need, and at that moment there will be a judge of desire, even if it is only the psychoanalyst.\n\nToday, we’re going to forget about everything we did before, but everything we did previously on the body without organs will be essential to us. Simply, bizarrely, a shift will take place, because, with the preceding planes, we had no reason to place a perverse statement, an alcoholic statement, a schizo statement, a social statement, a political statement on different planes; it was necessary, on the contrary, to treat them all like equivalents, that is to say, all producing themselves on bodies without organs of a different type. From now on, there will be a whole system involving the different types of BwO, the different types of statements, and the relationships between these statements. Here, it is going to be necessary to establish a whole differential system.\n\nWhat is this question of the production of statements? It is a relatively recent problem: three books in France pose, or else do not pose but revolve around, this question: how statements are produced, or what comes down to the same thing more concretely: how does one have done with old statements? How does one produce new statements? The three books are those of [Jean] Baudrillard, [Jean-Pierre] Faye and [Michel] Foucault. For Baudrillard, the examples of the production of statements are borrowed from aesthetics and in particular from a very concrete aesthetic involving the auction, the sale of paintings at an auction.[6] In the case of Foucault, the great examples he gives of the production of statements concern above all madness, in the 19th century, the production of new statements concerning madness, such as it happens in the 19th century, and on the other hand, the constitutive statements of the medical clinic in the 19th century as well.[7] In Faye, the core matter of his reflection on the production of new statements is Nazism: in what sense was Nazism the producer of statements with a new sense?[8] We must also look at Guattari’s book and notably the passage concerning the Leninist break which explicitly asks how to give an account of the production of new statements at the moment of the Bolshevik revolution.[9]\n\nIt seems to me that these theories have a common background which consists of several points: first, they are distinguished from the linguistic studies with which we have been submerged. Why? Because the linguistic studies have consisted above all in analyzing language in its formal elements of various tenors; while here, it concerns something absolutely different: a kind of discovery and insistence that linguistics had forgotten about the creative power of language; and here we can locate where that comes from. It obviously refers back to Chomsky. That’s the first common aspect to all the studies. There is a second aspect, which is that the problem of the production of statements, as a function therefore of a creative power of language, forces us to leave behind an overly simple conception of production, for the reason that statements themselves are part of the domain of production. From that moment, what is broken is the production/ideology duality. That implies therefore a transformation of the concept of production, namely a transformation which no longer goes in the traditional Marxist direction, where production is above all envisaged as material production. So we have the overhauling of the concept of production, and the suppression of the production/ideology duality, for the benefit of what? Here too, this is one of the common points among the three authors: to the benefit of the problem of power and of the organization of this power, precisely because blowing up the ordinary production/ideology duality will no doubt introduce the problem of the organization of power, as already forming part of an indissolubly economico-political structure.\n\nThe third common point is the attempt, sometimes successful, sometimes not successful, to break precisely with the linguistic category of signifier and signified. Fourth common point: it is to renew the problem of the unconscious by posing it at the level of statements. No longer to refer the unconscious to a machine of interpretation. Perhaps what I am saying does not hold equally for the three authors, but it is eminently valid for Foucault. It amounts to an attempt to discover the way in which desire invests economic forms themselves. These, it seems to me, are all the points in common between these three authors.\n\nWe will begin with the book by Baudrillard and see in what sense it fits, and in what sense it does not fit into the attempt. I ask those who know this book to give their opinion. The first thesis, in the Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign[10] … Just a parenthesis: as today it will really be about the study of texts, it probably goes without saying that it will be quite boring, and if those who aren’t interested want to leave, that’s fine by me; nevertheless [if you’re not familiar with the texts in question], that shouldn’t stop you from understanding anything either …\n\nBaudrillard’s first proposition is a veritable elimination and subordination of the category of production, and in any case, the category of production as material production. And there, that’s a real rupture with Marxism. And why is the category of material production like the statement?[11] Here, Baudrillard’s arguments are very clear: because material production refers to use-value, and because use-value itself presupposes completely artificial notions, like those of need and ideology. In other words, we must not start from use-value; from that moment, we must not start from material production, because material production is already wholly criss-crossed by a system of another nature: it is not use-value which is primary, and in Baudrillard there is a whole critique of use-value at work right from the beginning of his book. Which comes down to saying, second proposition, that what is primary is exchange. In a certain way, that comes down to saying something Marx also said, namely, that production in capitalism is the reproduction of capital; but at the beginning of Capital, one can indeed also find the path exchange-value, use-value. Baudrillard proposes a kind of reversal of the relation: exchange-value is primary, exchange is primary. Why? Because production itself, as material production, presupposes a “differential” matter of exchange: the big mistake is to make of differentiation “a superadded variable, […] a variable given by the situation”, whereas it is “a relational variable of the structure.”[12] As Veblen had seen – he is a great disciple of Veblen –, “the whole of society is regulated by the production of distinctive material.”[13] Now, precisely according to him, production is already differential production, production of distinctive materials, and this is insofar as it presupposes a whole system of exchange; in other words, exchange-value is primary, it is what is going to criss-cross production, and from that moment, it is this that is going to be primary in relation to use-value.\n\nFrom there, things get complicated, because Baudrillard’s third proposition is this: starting from exchange-value, a transmutation is produced. So here we are in a simple situation; someone is telling you that exchange-value is primary in relation to use-value, which can also mean: the exigencies of consumption are primary in relation to production, and in effect, at the level of the exigencies of consumption, there is already a handling of a distinctive material, of a differential material. Good. That implies an idea that it is necessary to retain for later, namely that the basis (I am not saying the form), the basis of capitalism is exchange-value. [Interruption of the recording]\n\n… Baudrillard’s third thesis concerns, in a certain way, a veritable transmutation of exchange-value, and for him, as for us, that will be the essential, namely the way in which exchange-value will transform itself into what he will call sign exchange-value, or what he calls sign-value, or what he calls sign-form.[14] That is going to be the crux of his problem, and I say to myself that it is also going to be ours, because how exchange-value … [Unfinished sentence] I’m not sure if it’s well posed, starting from exchange-value, because again: how does exchange-value transmute itself into sign-value, or sign-form – that’s another way of saying: how are statements produced in a system of exchange? How does the production of statements come about?\n\nThe answer consists in saying, if I understand correctly, that there is a destruction of exchange-value: in the circuit of exchange, there is a destruction of exchange-value, and the destruction of exchange-value occurs in expenditure – I won’t insist on it, but one feels [Georges] Bataille looming here –, and that it is in expenditure that the purchased object takes on sign-value, and that it is there that there is a production of signs. It is therefore in the act of expenditure that exchange-value becomes sign-value, and it is there that a production of signs comes about which does not belong to the superstructure, and which does not belong to ideology, but which does truly belong to the economic system.\n\nThat that truly belongs to the economic system, that’s also part of our concern – otherwise we would not have spoken about Baudrillard – namely: to introduce statements and to introduce desire into the economic infrastructure. What is the difference with exchange-value?\n\nIt is that, at that moment, the differential material which was already included in exchange-value ceases to be a pure matter and becomes form, sign-form. And it is there, in this transformation of exchange-value which itself was the bearer of material surplus value, in the transformation of exchange-value into sign-value, that a specific surplus-value of domination appears. And this is where the organization of power happens. This is page 115 and what follows.[15] On page 206, we find the formula: “Exchange-value is realized …” – is realized at the very moment it is annihilated as exchange-value – “is realized in sign-value.”[16] Once again, this production of sign-value is itself accomplished in expenditure. Hence the idea that a true psychoanalysis, that is to say a true desiring economy, must be brought about at the level of consumption and expenditure.\n\nFourth thesis: with the apparition of sign-value or of sign-form, there arises – this seems bizarre to me – the signifier-signified couple, because the sign is the set of the two. And there is produced a term-by-term assignation, signifier-signified, of which he gives at least one example in the case of the work of art, the signifier being the form, the signified being the function, and the set of the two constituting the sign or sign-value. Now, this constitutive signifier-signified, or the very elements of the sign, is as if traversed by something famous, namely the bar.[17] The bar is very important: it is what assigns a system of relations between the signifier and the signified; it is the bar that separates the signifier and the signified. If I understand right, the sign is therefore this bar itself which distributes signifier and signified, term by term, and he devotes a long footnote to Lacan saying: yes, Lacan does not make the signifier-signified term by term, but it comes down to the same thing, there is a domain of the signifier, a domain of the signified, and there is the bar.[18]\n\nAnd, last proposition: this bar of the signifier and signified, this constitutive bar of the sign and the sign-form, well, far from revealing something, it hides and occults. What it hides and occults, we don’t know yet. What is important at this level is that this is where I also see, whether fulfilled or non-fulfilled it does not matter, a part of the program of the theory of production of statements, namely to attempt to situate the problem of the unconscious and to renew the problem of the unconscious as a function of this question of the production of statements.\n\nSo, finally, the last thesis: what does it hide, this bar of the signifier and the signified, constitutive of the sign? We learn that it hides castration. According to him, the whole of modern capitalism is a way of concealing a sublime truth which is that of castration. It occludes castration because … I’m presenting it very badly: it’s because, as you can sense, I don’t understand anything here … It occludes castration because, he literally says in the article on ‘The Body’[19]: castration is only signified, and that, it is not good.[20] When castration is only signified, it is occluded because it is only signified, and that doesn’t bode well. Why? Castration is simultaneously signified and occluded as signified. That doesn’t go well because it seems, according to the article, that it is misrecognized; in what sense? Because what is misrecognized is the essence of desire, it is its proper [indistinct word], namely, it is lack. Look at [For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign] page 259 – ah, my reference is wrong.\n\nRichard [Pinhas]: I think I’ve got your reference.\n\nDeleuze: [Indistinct sentence]\n\nPinhas: “Lack is always that in terms of which we miss others, and through which others miss us”, page 208.\n\nDeleuze: That’s quite a statement. I’ve found the page 69: “[…] the entirely latent discourse, in the object, of the symbolic absence [manque] of the subject from himself and the other”[21] – yes yes yes yes yes – desire is “the desire for something lost, where it is lack, an absence on which the objects that signify it have come to be inscribed; what can it mean to take such objects literally, as if they were merely what they are?”[22]\n\nSo, this misrecognition of castration because castration is only signified, that corresponds to what stage? He says: it’s like this – it is very forced – and he chooses striptease as an example. He talks of the bar of the stockings on the thigh, which refers to the bar signifier-signified.[23] Castration is only signified, if I understand correctly. And the bar can be anything: “the clothes that come off, signalling the emergence of the body as phallus.”[24] All that is a “denial of castration.”[25] The ideal is the idea of a “naked body”, “full”, where castration is therefore occluded.\n\nThis is interesting to us because it makes the body without organs play a very specific role. The body without organs is precisely a body which operates the denial of castration. The difference of the sexes is ignored.[26] “More nude than nude”[27], “the woman painted in gold” … and he says, I can’t quite remember, but the spirit of it is: full body, non-porous, without exudation nor expression, without grain or roughness, vitrified.[28]\n\nThe difference with Lacan is that the bar signifier-signified, far from indicating castration, is, on the contrary, the sign that it is occluded, the mark of an occultation, the mark of a misrecognition of castration.\n\nBaudrillard’s last thesis: so, from that moment, since you see that this misrecognition of castration is not good, you see that basically there is a whole thesis here referring back to castration as belonging fundamentally to the essence of desire. The last thesis appears as: what is the true order of desire, including in an economy, an order of desire which would invest the economy as a function of a non-misrecognized castration, as a function of a recognized castration? His answer is this: it must be something other than sign-value.\n\nFor the moment, we have been playing on exchange-value, sign-value; and exchange-value became sign-value in a kind of transmutation; sign-value gave us the bar signifier-signified; that is to say, occulted castration. How to get oneself out of such a catastrophic situation, where desire misrecognizes castration, that is to say, misrecognizes its own being? Baudrillard says that there was a time when things were better. The time when things were better must be defined through a third term: this is symbolic value.[29] Symbolic value is beyond the signifier and the signified. It implies a kind of non-appearance; it is therefore opposed to sign-value. It is distinguished from sign-value, and Baudrillard’s whole book will play on the three terms exchange-value, sign-value and symbolic value, and symbolic value is beyond or below the signifier and the signified, why? Because it is lived under the reign of ambivalence.[30]\n\nIt is through ambivalence that one disburdens oneself of the signifier and signified, because, in Baudrillard, if I understand well, ambivalence is not simply the ambivalence of feelings in the sense of love/hate; it is the ambivalence of the signifiers and signifieds themselves. One no longer knows what is signifier and what is signified, and it is in this ambivalence that the value-sign is surpassed towards symbolic value; and we have seen that sign-value is referred to consumption and to the forgetting and denial of castration, while this value thing, symbolic value, refers to the recognition of castration and no longer to consumption [consommation], but to consummation [consummation]. We find ourselves right in the middle of the economy of gift/counter-gift.\n\nLet me quickly take up these propositions again: use-value is not primary, it is exchange-value that is primary. Exchange-value produces a distinctive or differential material. It must be transmuted into sign-value which, for its part, raises the differential or distinctive material to the level of form. Sign-value operates in expenditure and in consumption. The sign is constituted by the bar of signifier and the signified and it occludes the truth of desire which is castration, to the profit of a full body which is the body of the woman painted in gold. Finally, beyond all that, there is something which is symbolic value, made up of gift and counter-gift, of ambivalence, of recognition of castration, and which implies the very dissolution of the signifier and signified.\n\nI’d like it if those who know Baudrillard a bit could say if my summary is correct. Who has read Baudrillard well?\n\nRichard Pinhas: There is something thing that strikes me as odd in Baudrillard’s procedure, and it’s the only thing I can’t manage to explain to myself in relation to his methodology itself: he starts from something very Marxist, very traditional, which is the problem of difference and of indifference, the relationship of the producer to the objects he produces, and to his means of production. And Marx’s classical thesis is that with capitalism, we have to do with a social formation which functions with the producers separated from the means of production, in a relation of indifference to the objects they produce, something absolutely different from all other social formations, and the example he gives is of the artisan who makes his own object, that is to say, an unmediated relation with the object. And, starting from this indifference, Baudrillard will seek in the Freudian terms of the difference of the sexes and the denial of this difference – he will say that, with capitalism, since there is indifference to the objects produced, to objects sold, and since finally the only universal there is the abstract universal of value, he will say that the indifference vis-à-vis objects is covered over once again by [another] indifference: a denial of the split between the sexes. And I think that makes sense: at last, one sees how the mapping [recouvrement] of the Freudian field on a Marxist field works.\n\nDeleuze: If you want to say that it’s typically Freudo-Marxist, I am entirely in agreement.\n\nRichard Pinhas: And this approach will yield a reconciliation in symbolic exchange as a result. I absolutely do not understand how he brings about this symbolic exchange.\n\nDeleuze: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Basically, you understand even less than me. I was looking for someone who understands better … [Silence of students] Since you don’t want to speak, I’ll tell you what seems bizarre to me. To the question: what produces statements? … What produces statements in a capitalist formation or in another [social formation], since, after all, what choice is left to us? In any case, desire is lack, lack of itself, loss of itself, it is castration; indeed it’s through castration that one accedes to desire. What produces statements in the capitalist regime is what occludes castration, namely the bar … But I don’t understand why the bar occludes castration.\n\nGobard: It’s because he must be using ‘castration’ with two different meanings; the first, the old infantile and Freudian idea that the woman is a man deprived of sex, and the second where castration is the terminology used to speak of the difference of the sexes.\n\nDeleuze: Yes. He even says that symbolic castration is beyond the difference of the sexes. [Pause] In any case, what produces statements is castration. So that interests us and it does not interest us. It interests us since castration being, according to Baudrillard, at the very heart of desire, it is indeed a way of linking the problem of the production of statements to the problem of the posing of desire, and the formula ‘what produces statements is castration’ … – so in effect, a striptease dancer has a system of non-verbal statements that is linked to a code, the code of strip-tease; an African dance is another code; there are non-verbal statements – castration would therefore be what produces all statements, in two possible modes: either an occluded castration, or as an exhibited castration; which amounts to saying that what produces statements, in any case, is the splitting of the subject. Either the subject can be split by the bar of the signifier and signified, or it can be split in some other way – why it should be split, I don’t know – I’m keeping in mind the article on ‘The Body’ with regard to symbolic value. What is the difference between what exhibits and what hides castration, asks Baudrillard?\n\nThe difference is that in the case of what exhibits castration, one sees the radical difference – I am quoting exactly[31] – that traverses the subject in its irreducible ambivalence. But that’s a bit odd, because ambivalence was what came out of castration, but it turns out that the regime of ambivalence is another irreducible difference. In any case, it is a splitting of the subject that produces the statement. It is once again the old thesis we saw a long time ago: namely, the production of statements by a subject brings with it, through the effect of the statement itself, the splitting of the subject into the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement.\n\nIf, to the question: what produces statements? we are told that it is the splitting of the subject, our preceding analyses were tending towards a contrary result, namely that the splitting of the subject was a very precise effect obtained in order to prevent all production of statements. It is easy to show that, from the moment that a subject is split into subject of the statement and subject of enunciation, far from that engendering the least statement, it is the condition under which no statement can be produced. It is the same condition, and not by chance, that is at work with the psychoanalytic machine, when I was asking why and how it is that the psychoanalytic machine is set up to prevent any production of statements, at the very moment that it pretends to say to the poor patient: go right ahead, you can produce your statements here. All that was needed was the machine of interpretation. The whole of psychoanalysis lies in this: in your relations with your friends, with your work, with your children, etc., you are subject of the statement; in your relations with me, the psychoanalyst, and through the relation to me, the psychoanalyst, you are subject of enunciation.\n\nHence Lacan’s formidable stroke of calling the analysed person analysand. That consists in saying to someone: come and sit yourself on the couch, you will be the producer of statements, you will be the subject of enunciation. Before, psychoanalysts were much more modest because they said something like: if you are on the couch, and if you speak, you will, through the intermediary of my interpretation, accede to the status of subject of enunciation. This is why with the Lacanian recalibration, the psychoanalyst has less and less need to speak, he is more and more silent. The splitting is always assured in the same manner: throughout all your real life, you will be the subject of the statement; you accede to subject of enunciation in relation to the analyst who interprets what you are doing in your real life, so that you are only subject of enunciation in the cabinet of the analyst.\n\nNow, it is precisely this machine that suppresses all the conditions of enunciation. So that if Baudrillard’s thesis consists in saying to us: what produces statements is a split subject. Whether it is split according to the system of sign-value, or split in the system of symbolic value, it amounts to the same: it confuses the production of statements with its very opposite, namely what prevents and what suppresses all the conditions for the production of statements. That’s the first point.\n\nThe second point is that it is all very well to put use-value into question; he is surely right. But to put use-value into question in order to rely on exchange-value does not seem to me sufficient because, while you’re at it, if you keep exchange value, you reintroduce use-value. Baudrillard has alighted on an interesting problem, but which seems to me lost in advance: how to engender sign-value, that is to say, the sign-form, as he himself often says, that is to say, how to produce statements, how to engender them starting from exchange-value? Now, it seems that his answer either invokes a miracle or a parallelism. The miracle would be the act of expenditure which would transform, within exchange, exchange value into sign-value. In this case, I don’t see any very precise analysis, except strangely enough, in the case of the sale of paintings at an auction[32] – and all the same it’s a bit weird to conceive the capitalist system in the mode of the sale of paintings at auction. Because of his elimination of the category of production, the subordination of production to consumption, what he retains as the model of the capitalist object is not the machine, it is the gadget; this was already visible in his first book The System of Objects, where what he had in mind was a psychoanalysis of the object, and he was obliged therefore to conceive of machines as super-gadgets, instead of conceiving gadgets as residues of machines or as miniaturized machines.[33] The model of the gadget: he is indeed obliged to take such a model, that is to say, to ignore the whole machinic power [puissance] of both desire and of capitalism; he is indeed forced to completely occlude the power of the machine and the nature of the machine, in order to engender, starting from exchange-value … in order to crapulously engender sign-value, or the sign-form, from exchange-value, through a simple operation of expenditure.\n\nWhen use-value has been suppressed, while conserving exchange-value, one does not give oneself any condition to account for any transmutation at all, except in one case: the system of parallelism. As far as the book on the Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign goes, it seems to me that what’s involved is an operation that remains completely miraculous – this transformation of exchange-value into sign-value. With regard to the article on ‘The Body’, a parallelist point of view clearly appears between money [argent] and phallus.\n\nThis money-phallus parallelism, which will guarantee the passage from exchange-value, which is made with material money, to sign-value which is made with the formal phallus – a passage from material money, from material exchange, to formal phallic sign – this is what allows him, simply in the name of a metaphor or of a parallelism, to nimbly get away with saying: it is not embarrassing to establish a metaphor between money and the phallus because the phallus itself is a metaphor …\n\nWe fall back into a parallelist system; it was a question of knowing how desire invested the economy, and we fall back onto a simple parallelism between two economies; namely the transformation exchange-value/sign-value can only be done through a parallelism between money grasped as distinctive materiality and the phallus grasped as differential formality, this is where a system of parallelism between the two comes into play, and from that moment, it no longer at all keeps its implicit promise, namely: to show how desire invests the economy; it makes a junction through symbolization, through metaphor or through parallelism between two economies, a political economy and an economy of desire.\n\nFinally, third point, because it’s time for a rest: why is it that exchange-value is no more serious a notion than use-value. Why doesn’t it work?\n\nIt seems to me that it is for the following reason: first point: first of all, it seems to me that exchange, in Marxism, is an extraordinarily ambiguous and confused notion because the term ‘exchange’ brings along with it, as a concept, the theme of a certain equality between the things exchanged or exchangeable things. Marx says it very well, in principle; and, in fact, the problem of exchange is that what is exchanged are not equal things: namely, economically there is a fundamentally unequal character to economic exchange. On the conditions of the inequality of exchange, I cite for you two important and contemporary texts: Unequal Exchange [by Arghiri Emmanuel] published by Maspéro[34] and the book [Accumulation on a World Scale] by Samir Amin at Éditions de Minuit[35], where he takes up and corrects the theory of unequal exchange; and the book by Samir Amin is very good. He takes up the theory of unequal exchange, but he doesn’t at all take it up as belonging fundamentally to exchange, but he takes it up at the level of the Third World, that is to say: under what conditions, on the periphery of capitalism, under what conditions and why, is the exchange Third-World–developed countries fundamentally an unequal exchange?\n\nThis notion of exchange brings with it by right a principle of equality and in fact mobilises an essential inequality; and the whole Marxist problem of surplus value comes from that: how to account for the inequality of exchange? And Marx’s answer is precisely an arithmetical answer; and you understand why it can only be an arithmetical answer that accounts for the inequality and for the exchange, when the problem has been posed only in terms of exchange.\n\nWhen the problem has been posed only in terms of exchange, there can be no answer to the question: why the inequality of exchange? There can only be an arithmetical answer, precisely because exchange has absorbed by right this sort of postulate of equality, and it’s a matter of accounting, starting from an equality presupposed by right, for an inequality affirmed in fact. From that moment, this can only be done under the form of a plus and a minus, and one aspect of the Marxist theory of surplus value is precisely to explain how the inequality of exchange is situated at the level of the sale and purchase of labor power, that is to say, how a surplus value is created linked to the wage-earners or to the purchase of labor power, a surplus value translatable in terms of plus and minus, which will account for the inequality of exchange.\n\nNow, what doesn’t work in that? Once again, it’s that, in a certain way, it can’t keep the promises given. The promise given was to show how, in a social formation, social production was coded by something more profound, that is to say, how ultimately production was not primary. Now, in order to show how production is not primary at the level of the economy, we opt for the exchange mechanism.\n\nA sort of circuit of exchange would first of all be abstract, and there is a place for that, and in relation to which it would be necessary to engender the immediacy of fact, which could only be done, once again, through an arithmetical process. When Marx talks of exchange, he indeed talks of it as an abstract form; there is no society which functions like that. Also, I said last year that it was necessary to substitute a completely different mechanism for it.\n\nWhat traverses a society is not a circuit of exchange; it is a completely different circuit which does not refer us to arithmetic, but which refers us to a differential apparatus. And it is very curious that Baudrillard himself feels the need to invoke a differential matter, a distinctive matter and a differential form, but starting from an exchangeist structure which, it seems to me, does not support it. What defines, on the contrary, a social field, whether it is capitalist or something else, is not at all the unequal or equal quantities which would enter into a relation of exchange, it is the quantities of different powers, quantities of powers in the mathematical sense of the word power [puissance]; these are different potentialities. The question is not: equal quantities or unequal quantities, because that’s the problem of exchange, but that has never worked with this thing.\n\nWhat functions in an economic formation is the different powers of quantities, that is to say the flows that traverse the social field. These are not quantities of the same power, and therefore the (pseudo-)mathematical apparatus which can account for that is obviously not arithmetic, it is necessarily differential calculus, since differential calculus, I remind you, is made to treat quantities which are not of the same power.[36] The differential relation is precisely a relation which makes it possible to confront and compare quantities which are not of the same power. Differential calculus would be stripped of meaning if your idea was just to apply it to quantities of equal power. Therefore, it does not seem to me at all that one should start from a circuit of exchange, where one would play with a presupposed equality and an inequality to be engendered, which is closer to the relation exchange-value–sign-form in the false genesis proposed by Baudrillard. Rather one must start from what is immediately given in a political economic field, namely quantities which are different.\n\nMoney [argent] in the capitalist system appeared to us last year as a system of these quantities of different powers. Where money [argent] intervenes as structure of financing, I would say the quantity is of power X, and where it concerns money taken as means of payment, let’s put money taken as quantity of power I. It is not the same money that is endowed with a purchasing power and that constitutes the capital of a society. It is not the same ‘money’ [argent] which is money [monnaie] and which is capital.[37] All the economists know this since the question of the economy since the crisis is: how to create capital with only a little money [monnaie], or even, at the limit, without money [monnaie] [missing word]. The problem of Nazism – see Faye’s book – the economic problem of Doctor Schacht was: how is it possible to make capital without money?[38] Now, money [argent] as purchasing power at your disposal, which is a medium of exchange, – if it is true that use-value[39] is second in relation to exchange-value, exchange-value itself is second in relation to something else, namely the differential relations between quantities of different powers, between irreducible quantities of powers.\n\nThese two irreducible forms of money [argent], I said last year that they have a fictive homogeneity which is guaranteed by the banking system, which is guaranteed by the central bank. And what we will see in the case of Nazism is how, at the moment they wanted to de-index capital from gold, they precisely had to bring about a whole system of discounting and re-discounting, operations of discounting and multiple discounting, precisely in order to guarantee this play of quantities of power that are absolutely different, money [monnaie] as structure of financing and money [monnaie] as means of payment: And that is what I want to say: money as means of payment is thus money as exchange-value and through which exchange occurs; money as structure of financing is absolutely not that; money as structure of financing is, since Keynes, the object of creation and destruction. It is creation and destruction. And even when, for example, you have a monetary mass which remains constant, for example of 1000 over two years, that does not mean at all that, as the classical economists said, the monetary mass has stayed constant, it means that there have been creations of money and destructions of money which would be equivalent to each other, which is absolutely different; but money as structure of financing never ceases to be traversed by movements of creation and destruction. It is money as means of payment that is determined by its status as a means of exchange.\n\nHere I am sticking to – and this is why I’m making progress in my analysis – it may seem slight, but I’m just sticking to our thing about there being two flows. I was saying that two flows [flux] are needed when something flows [coule]. The other day, for the alcoholic, it was his flow of masturbation and his flow of writing. Here, at the level of the body of capital, there are indeed two flows; it’s two flows, in some relation, it’s the flow of money as structure of financing and the flow of money as exchange-value or means of payment. This thing interests me a lot, because, if you recall the analysis of the drunken crisis last time[40], – and I don’t care whether it’s money [argent] or it’s rot or it’s sperm; but if I don’t care whether it’s one or the other, it is not at all at the level of a dumb metaphorical system of equivalences of the psychoanalytic genre, it’s at the level of this: in any case, it’s the abstract machine which is at play in both cases, independently of the quality of the flows. In any case, you will have a minimum of two flows which stream on a body without organs; you have a system of completely fictive equivalences guaranteed by the play of the banks, the play of discounting and re-discounting; what matters is that two flows being given, one is necessarily more deterritorialized than the other; and there, it is obvious that in this case with my two flows of money, money as means of payment, means of exchange, purchasing power, it’s the same thing: you receive at the end of the month a wage, this wage corresponds to a purchasing power, to a means of exchange … [Interruption of the recording]\n\n… it can only be understood in its relationship with a flow of a radically different power [puissance] and which it is not a power [puissance] of purchasing power [pouvoir d’achat], is not a power of exchange, but is a power which surpasses us because of the very instruments of the capitalist machine, because of capitalism itself – namely a power of a completely different nature, of creation-destruction, the structure of financing.\n\nTherefore, that exchange is by nature unequal, there is no need to explain it within the circuit of exchange. You only have to see that the flow of exchange which presupposes money as purchasing power, derives from a differential relation with a flow of a completely different power, from which it receives, by nature, a fundamentally unequal character. In this case, there is always one of the two flows which plays the deterritorialized-deterritorializing role, which comes to the same, and which, as a result, is like the dominant one, or the one that envelopes the other. In this case, there is no need to continue, as Gobard says, that goes without saying.\n\nWhat does that mean, wages–purchasing power? It is precisely exchange. In capitalism, it is the means by which one reterritorializes wages, the fixed wage, demands for an increase in wages … You see, all the processes of reterritorialization in the capitalist system – namely with your wages, you will go and buy yourself your little house, you will buy your fridge … I’m not being ironic here: I am defining processes of territoriality and reterritorialization that we know well. And the demand for wages is reterritorialization within the framework of the trade union; there is a whole chain of territorialities: the family, purchasing power, the party, the union, which play on this flow of money to the power I, namely what goes in and what comes out of the wallet of a worker or of a non-worker, which is defined as wealth or as poverty, and which is therefore a flow of a certain nature – this is what is assumed by exchange and which already includes inequality. The other, the flow of structure of financing, object of creation and destruction which is capital, in opposition, if you like, to money [monnaie] as purchasing power – because ultimately, a capital is not realizable. It is only realizable in one case, that of bankruptcy, when it ceases to be capital. An enterprise does not realize its capital. I am not saying that capital exhausts the structure of financing, I’m saying that capital forms part of money [argent] as structure of financing. There are other things which form part of it: for example: State subsidies, for example: investments, but these things are never realizable here and now, and it is at their level that the creations-destructions of money [monnaie] take place, which involves, through concrete mechanisms: banks, emissions of money [monnaie].\n\nAlthough a monetary mass can remain constant, that does not prevent it from being constantly and several times renewed, several times created and several times destroyed. Now, it is obvious that this is deterritorialized money [argent] because it fundamentally rests on a play of multiple inscriptions, on a play of discount and re-discount, and it is even because it is so deterritorialized that it can intervene several times. We would have to get in a specialist to explain to us the relationship between the contemporary economy, the American economy, and the Nazi economy, because there is at least something in common; it is that in a given time, the same sum is used several times; that is how one can make capital with very little money [monnaie]. The same sum serves several times through the play of discounts and re-discounts over a period of time where the same sum intervenes at several levels. Now, in the mechanism of the contemporary economy, in the case of a rather mysterious entity like Euro-dollars, this is also very clear: it is precisely a system where a single sum will intervene several times by way of a play of writings, effecting an auto-accumulation. Here, you have the example of a form of money [argent], at the limit deterritorialized – it’s called Euro-dollars, which implies all the same that there is, within the very movement of deterritorialization, something like territorial anchoring points, like points of reterritorialization which will prepare other flows: the territorial flow of money as purchasing power. Now, I say that it is the deterritorialized flow, creation-destruction, of power X and the other flow, the territorial flow of purchasing power, which constitutes the whole basic economic system, and not at all exchange.\n\nA student: [Indistinct words]\n\nDeleuze: What do you do with coins [sous]? You exchange them; it is not the money [argent] which itself is more territorialized, it is that in its very use, it is a means of exchange, and that what you exchange it for is by nature territorializing. Either you hoard your money, and you make a territorial usage of it, or you exchange it for objects, and these objects form your environment, your territory. While capital as structure of financing is if need be territorialized to the extent that it is attached to such and such an enterprise, the day that no longer works –  it no longer works in the East, so let’s head off to the South. The mobility of capital is the measure of its deterritorialization; although one should not exaggerate, there are indices of territoriality in structures of financing: for example, a given territory will make a call. And they make territorial appeals to capital under what form? They will say for example: look how cheap our labour is. So it’s through that, the territorial characteristics of money as means of payment, that the indices of territoriality are established in capital as structure of financing, which by itself is deterritorialized; and if that does not work at some location, a well-known phenomenon takes place: capital flight. One must not be surprised that there are movements of capital flight, it is in the very nature of capital. What is surprising is that capital stays still, but it only rests in appearance since, once again, when a monetary mass remains constant, it is only in appearance that there is constancy of mass; in fact, there is a series of creations and destructions at the end of which you find the same abstract quantity. But in fact, it has not ceased moving.\n\nI just want to conclude on this: there is no question of making the genesis of anything whatsoever by starting with statements that start from the circuit of exchange. Moreover, starting from the circuit of exchange, it is not surprising that Baudrillard discovers castration: starting from the circuit of exchange you will never engender anything but statements of the Poujadist type. You will never engender the least master statement, the least dominant statement of a social formation, you will only engender platitudinous statements of everyday life. What is generative of statements is the differential relation between the flows of quantities of irreducible powers, and it is in the separation and interplay of these flows that statements will be produced. And I am announcing, for what follows, that this seems to me a key to the question that Faye sets himself, namely how were Nazi statements produced at a certain time? We will see that it is not according to this general formula, but that it is according to a variant of this general formula that these were produced.\n\nI summarise. The genesis of statements that Baudrillard proposes comes down to this: what would be productive of statements is a subject, it is the subject. Now from the moment one says that, the trick is already played, there is nothing to claw back: as soon as one says that, it means a subject split into subject of the statement and subject of enunciation; now this splitting, otherwise named castration, is not what produces statements, but what prevents the production of statements.\n\nSecondly, he promised to show us how desire invested the social economic field, and he promised this to us by announcing to us a genesis of sign-value starting from exchange value. Now this attempt leads to the restoration of a simple money-phallus parallelism, and which, on the other hand, is in principle impossible, because exchange-value is absolutely no more primary than use-value. And, finally, it is not by chance that, within the framework of his system, the true model of the capitalist object for him is the gadget; this is linked to the two things just mentioned. The only positive thing we have retained is the idea that statements always presuppose a field of flows, on condition that these flows do not presuppose once more an exchangeist circuit but presuppose flows on condition that these flows are considered as quantities affected with different powers, in such a manner that one of the flows can always be assigned as deterritorializing, and the other as territorial.\n\nIt is perhaps in this way that we will see more concretely how the production of statements is made … [End of recording]\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Either Deleuze is referring to an unrecorded part of Session 3 (14 May 1973) of this Seminar, or to an intervening, unrecorded session that would presumably have taken place on 21 May 1973; cf. footnote 40 below.\n\n[2] The École freudienne was a psychoanalytic institutional body founded in 1964 by Jacques Lacan (and dissolved in 1980).\n\n[3] Probably a reference to the work of the ‘Circle of Epistemology’ [Cercle d’épistémologie], published in the journal Cahiers pour l’Analyse from 1966-1969.\n\n[4] Pulsion is often translated as ‘drive’; pulsionnel can be translated as ‘instinctual’ or ‘impulsive’; however, there is a case for the coinage ‘pulsional’, to denote ‘what appertains to drives’.

And when it happens to be a desire for something experienced as lost, when it is a lack, an absence on which the objects that signify it have come to be inscribed, does it make any sense to treat such objects literally, as if they were merely what they are? And what can the notion of need possibly refer to, in these circumstances?” (translation modified) (« Le désir, lui, se signifie au long de toute une chaîne de signifiants. Et du moment où il est désir de quelque chose de perdu, où il est manque, absence sur laquelle viennent s’inscrire les objets qui la signifient — que peut bien vouloir dire prendre les objets pour ce qu’ils sont? Que signifie la notion de besoin?”).\n\n[23] Baudrillard, ‘The Body’, p. 101-102: “Fashion, advertising, nude-look, nude theatre, strip-tease: the play-script of erection and castration is everywhere. It has an absolute variety and an absolute monotony. Ankle boots and thigh boots, a short coat under a long coat, over the elbow gloves and stocking-tops on the thigh, hair over the eyes or the stripper’s G-string, but also bracelets, necklaces, rings, belts, jewels and chains the scenario is the same everywhere: a mark that takes on the force of a sign and thereby even a perverse erotic function, a boundary to figure castration which parodies castration as the symbolic articulation of lack, under the structural form of a bar articulating two full terms (which then on either side play the part of the signifier and the signified in the classical economy of the sign). The bar makes a zone of the body work as its corresponding terms here. This is not an erogenous zone at all, but an erotic, eroticised zone, a fragment erected into the phallic signifier of a sexuality that has become a pure and simple concept, a pure and simple signified. // In this fundamental schema, analogous to that of the linguistic sign, castration is signified (it passes into the state of a sign) and therefore subject to misrecognition. The nude and the not-nude play in a structural opposition and thus contribute to the designation of the fetish. The image of the stocking top on the thigh derives its erotic potential not from the proximity of the real genital and its positive promise (from this naïve functionalist perspective, the naked thigh would have to play the same role), but from the apprehension surrounding the genitals (the panic of recognising castration) being arrested in a staged castration. The innocuous mark, the line of the stocking above which, instead of lack, ambivalence and the chasm, there is nothing more than a sexual plenitude. The naked thigh and, metonymically, the entire body has become a phallic effigy by means of this caesura, a fetishistic object to be contemplated and manipulated, deprived of all its menace. As in fetishism, desire can then be fulfilled at the cost of warding off castration and the death drive.”\n\n[24] Baudrillard, ‘The Body’, p. 102: “The bar is always there as the clothes come off, signalling the emergence of the body as phallus.”\n\n[25] Baudrillard, ‘The Body’, p. 102: “The body is not arranged into masculine or feminine symbols: at a much deeper level, it is the site of the drama and the denial of castration” (cf. p. 104). Baudrillard bases his ideas here on Freud’s theory of fetishism (in particular, the 1927 paper ‘Fetishism’, translated by James Strachey et al., Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud (London: Hogarth Press, 1955, Vol. 21). In an earlier essay, ‘Fetishism and Ideology: The Semiological Reduction’ (first published in the Objets du fétichisme [Objects of fetishism] issue of the Nouvelle revue de psychanalyse, No. 2, Autumn 1970), Baudrillard develops a similar line of thought: “[T]he perverse psychological structure of the fetishist is organized, in the fetish object, around a mark, around the abstraction of a mark that negates, bars and exorcises the difference of the sexes” (p. 92). Baudrillard is also here developing ideas about castration, fetishism and the phallus from Lacanian psychoanalytic theory. One possible source of Baudrillard’s idea that the woman’s body itself ends up functioning as both a ‘fetish’ and a ‘phallus’ can be found in Lacan, ‘The Signification of the Phallus’ (Écrits, p. 694, French pagination).\n\n[26] Cf. the second section of Baudrillard, ‘The Body’, on ‘Secondary Nudity’, or fetishised nudity (pp. 104-107).\n\n[27] Baudrillard, ‘The Body’, p. 105: “The tights in which ‘you are more naked than is natural [au naturel]’”. Cf. p. 121, n.2.\n\n[28] Cf. Baudrillard, ‘The Body’, p. 105: “The James Bond film Goldfinger provides a perfect example of this [‘secondary nudity’]. In it, a woman is painted in gold, all her orifices are blocked up in a radical make-up, making her body a flawless phallus (that the make-up should be gold only emphasises the homology with political economy), which of course amounts to death. The nude gold-varnished playgirl will die by having incarnated to an absurd extent the phantasm of the erotic, but this is the case for every skin in functional aesthetics, in the mass culture of the body. ‘Body hugging’ tights, girdles, stockings, gloves, dresses and clothes, not to mention sun-tans: the leitmotiv of the ‘second skin’ and the transparent pellicle always come to vitrify the body.”\n\n[29] The first use of the term ‘symbolic value’ in For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign occurs in ‘The Ideological Genesis of Needs’, p. 65, where it is related to the example of the gift, which had been discussed at the beginning of the book in the first essay, ‘Sign Function and Class Logic’, pp. 30-31, in the context of ‘symbolic exchange’.\n\n[30] Cf. For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, ‘The Ideological Genesis of Needs’, p. 65: “The ambivalence of all symbolic exchange material (looks, objects, dreams, excrement) derives from this; the gift is a medium of relation and distance; it is always love and aggression”. Cf. p. 66.\n\n[31] Possibly a reference to the opening sentence of ‘The Body’: “The entire contemporary history of the body is the history of its demarcation, the network of marks and signs that have since covered it, divided it up, annihilated its difference and its radical ambivalence in order to organise it into a structural material for sign-exchange […]” (p. 101).\n\n[32] Baudrillard, For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, ‘The Art Auction: Sign Exchange and Sumptuary Value’, pp. 115-120.\n\n[33] Jean Baudrillard, The System of Objects (translated by James Benedict, London: Verso Books 1996 [1968]), Section C, ‘The Metafunctional Dysfunctional System: Gadgets and Robots’, pp. 109-133. Baudrillard also uses the term machin, translated as ‘gizmo’. On the ‘schizo-functional’ world of gadgets and gizmos, cf. p. 113; on gizmos and machines, cf. pp. 114-118: “The word ‘machine’, in becoming applicable to the realm of social labor, has acquired a precise enough generic sense; as recently as the late eighteenth century, however, it had much the same meaning as ‘gizmo’ [machin] today” (p. 115).\n\n[34] Arghiri Emmanuel, Unequal Exchange: A Study in the Imperialism of Trade (translated by Brian Pearce, New York: Monthly Review Press, 1972 [1969]).\n\n[35] Samir Amin, Accumulation on a World Scale: A Critique of the Theory of Underdevelopment (translated by Brian Pearce, 2.

Deleuze, Difference and Repetition (translated by Paul Patton, London: Athlone Press, 1994 [1968]), p. 174: “Calculus considers only those magnitudes where at least one is of a power superior to another.”\n\n[37] The French distinction between argent and monnaie is sometimes mapped onto the English distinction between ‘money’ and ‘currency’, and in this and the following sentence such a transposition would have its advantages. However, in the following paragraphs, Deleuze seems to use argent as a neutral term for money, and to specify two forms of monnaie: money as financing structure (which is said to include capital) and money as means of payment (or purchasing power). Since ‘currency’ is not synonymous with ‘means of payment’, it is not used here for monnaie. This makes rendering the present sentence awkward, and the makeshift solution of putting quote marks around ‘money’ for argent has been chosen. In any case, it is not clear whether Deleuze’s uses of argent and monnaie are systematically differentiated.\n\n[38] See Jean-Pierre Faye, Langages totalitaires, pp. 664-676 (cited in A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 570-571, n. 62), where the secret economic plan of Hjalmar Schacht, the president of the German Central Bank in the first years of Nazi rule, to fund German rearmament through the system of ‘Mefo bills’, is discussed. Deleuze returns to this topic in the fifth recorded session of this Seminar, taking up Faye’s account of the complex relationship between the movements of the Nazi economy and the ‘narrative’ level of political statements.\n\n[39] The transcript has valeur d’échange (‘exchange value’), but valeur d’usage (‘use-value’) would make more sense.\n\n[40] There is no discussion of a case of alcoholism or a “drunken crisis” in the transcript of the third recorded session (14 May 1973) of this Seminar, therefore (see footnote 1 above), either the discussion occurred in an unrecorded part of that session, or Deleuze’s remark refers to an unrecorded intervening session.\n\n"

Stivale and Christian Kerslake\n\n\nTranslated by Christian Kerslake\n\nThere is a critical thread and a very vague positive line of research. The critical thread is that evidently, far from favoring the emergence of statements, psychoanalysis prevents any emergence of statements, and it deprives us of any chance of holding onto statements which are our own. This runs through everything. But the positive part, what interested us, was: what are the conditions of the production of statements which are specific to us, whether they are statements of individuals or statements of groups? And by virtue of the same thing, what are the conditions of a [indistinct word]? It is not surprising that psychoanalysis, by nature, deprives us of all possibility of enunciation; it is truly by nature that it considers the unconscious as something after the fact. The unconscious as, once again, something which is always already there, and to be reduced through a machine of interpretation. For our part, we consider the unconscious, on the contrary, as something which is never there, and which is to be produced, to be produced by a machine of experimentation. If I tried to sum up everything I have developed this year, it is that.\n\nIn passing, I would like to underline a few small things: last year, we attempted, with Guattari, a kind of critique of Oedipus, and in that regard, [word missing] there are lots of people who have said to us: Oedipus, you’ve understood nothing about it, Oedipus was never the father and the mother. So, what is it?\n\nWe are then told: Oedipus is the entrance to culture, or Oedipus is the entrance to the symbolic order, or Oedipus is the finitude of being, or Oedipus is the lack of being that is desire, or the lack of being which is life, or etc. There are even perverse variations: some say it’s not the father and the mother, it’s symbolic triangulation, or quaternation. This is the position of the symbolic school, the École freudienne.[1] And there are others who say: okay, it’s daddy and mommy, only the triangulation is not Oedipus: that’s Rene Girard.[2] That seems even funnier to me because, when we ask how it works, whether they are from the École freudienne or another school, it’s all very well their saying: Oedipus is the symbolic, or: it is the entrance into the symbolic – the question is how does that work in concrete terms? Let me take a text by an author I shall not name, where he tells us of his patient: “He proceeds, without for all that having abandoned his sucking, chewing and obscene articulation …” – it’s a bit harsh treating his patient like that, because at the end of the day, the articulation of analysts can also sometimes leave something to be desired – “… through a sequence on the Bouches du Rhône, the Camargue, the pleasures of horse riding and the sea. Invitation to a voyage that I punctuate with a “bouche de la mère” [mouth of the mother]. In turn, disgusted, I would be tempted to say …” – there the patient has something going for him – “ … he stops in the grip of the greatest perplexity, before the gap that echoes back from his own speech.” That is a marvel.\n\nIt’s like the letter where the guy said: “I want to go to a hippy group”; for me, that means something quite specific.[3] Maybe he’s making a mistake – but that’s not the question – but “I want to go to a hippy group” means: I want to produce the unconscious. It means: I’m stuck, I’m in an environment where all production of the unconscious is impossible, I want to produce the unconscious. A schizoanalysis sets off in this direction: why does he want to produce the unconscious in this specific place? How is he going to produce it, etc? And his analyst said to him: “Hippy group = big pippee, you are impotent, it’s always your theme of impotence.” Here we see the radical misdeeds, the disgusting misdeeds of the machine of interpretation. The guy has no chance of escaping, he cannot hold onto a single statement. When someone comes and says to someone: “I want to go to a hippy group” and the other replies: “Ah, it’s always your theme of impotence, castration again!”, one is screwed from the beginning.\n\nNow, in this text, I note first of all a blatant contempt for the patient, an unbearable contempt. Why is the patient defined by a “sucking, chewing and obscene articulation” while the analyst endows himself with a clear, luminous and intelligent voice? Then, the guy talks about the Bouches du Rhône and the analyst, with all his finesse, says: Bouches du Rhône = bouche de la mère. The machine of interpretation prevents the guy from making the slightest statement. In this regard, the commentary of the analyst has a touching naivety, because he even notices that the guy is completely disgusted: “In turn, disgusted, I would be tempted to say, he stops …” Nothing troubles an analyst; he translates: he is disgusted, not by the enormity of what I have just said, he is disgusted by the perspicacity of what I have just said – “… before the gap which echoes back from his own speech.” The gap that echoes back from his own speech, that’s not difficult: when you pass any statement whatever in front of the machine of interpretation, necessarily, by the same fact, the immediate effect of this passage is what we saw last time: a splitting of the subject into subject of the statement and subject of enunciation; you are subject of a statement when you say ‘the Bouches du Rhône’, but the true subject of the statement is you-as-interpreted, namely ‘the Bouches du Rhône is the mother’s mouth.’ The analyst has split the subject and he is surprised afterwards that the other is perplexed in the face of the gap that echoes back from his own speech. He didn’t even have the time to say anything, that’s what’s so fascinating in this psychoanalytic operation.\n\nSo what I insist on is that it is in the same way that psychoanalysis inhibits all production of statements and treats the unconscious as something to reduce through the interpretation machine; and on the contrary, that it incites statements or even manages to hear, to make enunciation possible, whether it be of individuals or of groups – at the same time, that is what it is to produce the unconscious; the unconscious: you do not have it, the unconscious is not there, the unconscious is not in your early childhood. The unconscious is something which is produced and which can only be produced in places, in circumstances which are precisely non-repressive places, circumstances and events.\n\nOne of the aspects of repression is precisely – and it is through this that psychoanalysis participates in repression in the strictest sense – …, on the contrary, the condition of production of the unconscious implies places where repression is no longer exercised in the form of a splitting of the subject (we will distinguish in you the subject of the statement and the subject of enunciation, and this splitting will be precisely the splitting of castration). It is in this sense that for the past few weeks we have been revolving around the idea: to produce statements or to produce the unconscious: this is strictly the same thing. This is what I explained badly last time, because I said that to understand this properly, you have to see that when I say that the unconscious is not already there, that we must not look for it in childhood, I mean something quite simple: I don’t at all mean, as in ordinary psychoanalytic vocabulary, that what counts is the actual [actuels] factors[4] of a disorder, as opposed to the infantile factors, I mean something else again, because once again, the valorization of the actual factors against the infantile factors, in particular at the level of neurosis – that came about in the context of all the ruptures, all the dissidences with Freud; and the disagreements with Freud never changed anything fundamental. I mean, on the contrary, that, however far back you go in someone’s childhood, the problem is already this: how is a child going to produce the unconscious? It is in this sense that I say that it is never ‘there’. It is never there because the child already found himself faced with the task: are they going to prevent me – even if he does not formulate it in this way – from producing the unconscious or am I going to be in favourable conditions to produce it?\n\nIt is obvious that one of the fundamental aspects of repression in education is to prevent the production of the unconscious in the child. In what way? I’m confused and this is why I’m coming back to this: I was saying that what really needs to be distinguished is childhood blocs and childhood memory. Only here, childhood memory is not something which exists after the fact. Not at all. We have to go back to Bergson, because he is very good, Bergson. Bergson is anyway the one who, one day, came up with a crazy theory of memory; and then became the first philosopher who, as philosopher, truly got under the skin of the psychiatrists. He wrote Matter and Memory, which put a kind of disorder into psychiatry; … that’s already very good. Bergson had a very simple and very beautiful idea; he said: memory is contemporaneous with what one remembers; it is at the same time that something is present or is past.[5] For a very simple reason: because if we had to wait for the present to pass in order to create the memory of the present that has become past, in order to create the memory of the former present, it would never constitute itself. If it were necessary to wait until the former present was no more for the memory of this present to be formed, there would be no possibility of forming a memory; it is therefore necessary, and this was the schema of a kind of divergent line, [that] at each moment the present doubles in two directions, one stretched towards the future, one stretched towards the past[6]; that is to say: it is at the same time that the present is lived as present and that the memory of this present is created; which allowed him to explain in parentheses the phenomenon known as paramnesia, that is to say, phenomena of déjà vu, déjà vécu [already experienced]; he said that there is nothing surprising about it, it’s just a disorder of perception. Since the memory is constituted contemporaneously with that of which it is the memory, all it takes is a disorder in the line of bifurcation so that, instead of perceiving the thing as present, you perceive the memory of the thing, since the memory is contemporaneous with the thing, and, at that moment, you have a phenomenon of paramnesia.\n\nIt is in this sense that we should distinguish childhood blocs and childhood memories. And the childhood bloc is truly [indistinct word] from early childhood. And there, I say that in the childhood bloc you will find nothing of what psychoanalysis tells us to be the life of childhood; you will find nothing Oedipal there. You will find a completely different affair there; you will find there a whole ensemble of machinic connections, machinic connections which form the true life of the unconscious, non-figural and non-symbolic. A child playing hopscotch or playing with a ball: there is a whole system there of blocs of childhood in the living state, in the actual state, and you will find there a life of childhood that does not refer to psychoanalytical coordinates, that is to say, the famous coordinates of Oedipus-castration. It is at the same time that the memory of this life is constituted. There is contemporaneity between the living bloc of childhood and the memory of childhood, and the memory of childhood is fundamentally Oedipal, just like the dream.\n\nOf course, the psychoanalysts are justified at the level of the dream: it is the same movement which produces Oedipus and which produces the dream – but that’s not what counts. Childhood memory is Oedipal because the child constitutes, creates his childhood memory contemporaneously with the corresponding childhood bloc, but he creates it entirely already related to the Oedipal coordinates, because he creates it wholly at the level of a veritable narrative conduct: what I am going to tell mummy, what I am going to tell daddy; at the level of consciousness, of the pre-conscious, of the unconscious, a kid does not pass a day without selecting, that is to say without living on a double register – but once again strictly at the same time, – that of which he has the memory and the memory itself, namely the lived bloc of childhood which determines desiring connections, and the childhood memory which, on the contrary, is already a past, but a past strictly contemporaneous with the present of which it is the past, and which retains what, of the desires of the child, will be able to be related to the father and to the mother. This is narrative conduct. Here, we would have to go back to [Pierre] Janet: old Janet had a very nice theory about [missing word – narrative?][7], about memory and recollection as being essentially a conduct that consists in referring to the people to whom one is (at least possibly) going to recount a narrative [récit].[8]\n\nSo, in effect, there is already a whole crushing of the unconscious which is produced at the level of childhood memory, not at all because memory is produced after the fact, but on the contrary, because it is contemporaneous with what is remembered, because it is strictly at the same time as the corresponding present; it is not at the same time as a new present which would succeed the old one, it is contemporary with the old present of which it is the memory. And it is in this way that it represents a fantastic work of selection, where only those connections of a child’s desire will be retained that are capable of being related to daddy and mommy. Memory, by nature, is Oedipal, and it is memory that has projected the shadow of an unconscious which would already be there, and always was already there, and which would be to be interpreted. So that the task vis-a-vis the child is to disengage childhood blocs from the childhood memories that cover them over. Childhood blocs are the child’s pieces of experimentation. Childhood memory – that’s a child who, whatever he does, against his will, finds himself defenseless in the face of interpretations, and he finds himself defenseless in the face of these interpretations of the adult because childhood memory is precisely the process through which the child of a narrative is constituted as subject of the statement, and therefore refers to a superior authority, whether it be the father or something else, who will discover the true subjects of enunciation, that is to say that he will make an interpretation; so that here I would say: the childhood bloc is really the machinic assemblages which produce the real statements of the child. Once again, it is never a subject which produces the statements, it is the machinic connections, it is the connections of desire that traverse the child and which produce such or such statement.\n\nNow, the combination machinic assemblages–production of statements is opposed to the process of interpretation which is based entirely on childhood memory, the splitting of a subject into subject of statement and subject of enunciation with, as a postulate, that what would produce statements are not machinic assemblages. These are not free connections of desire, rather what would produce statements is the subject. The idea that it is the subject which produces statements is already the sufficient condition for no statement to be produced, it is already the great inhibition of every statement, ensured by the machine of interpretation.\n\nThe problem of the child – once it is said that one never ceases being a child, that already goes without saying, there is no difference in nature at the level of desire … There is no desire of the child on the one hand, and desire of the adult on the other, but that does not prevent there from being a catastrophic, dramatic difference. It’s that there are people who live childhood and their own childhood under the form of childhood memories. And there, we cannot say enough to what extent psychoanalysis is not the only one responsible for this, but to what extent it supports this oppressive force that makes us live our childhood under the form of childhood memories, all sorts of social forces, familial forces, etc., forces which push us to live our childhood under the form of childhood memories, and which from then on, send us back to interpretation: “Mummy, tell me, is it really true that that happened to me when I was little?” This time, it is the machine of familial interpretation: above all, you should not ask your mum for anything, above all not a childhood memory. Or, there is the other technique, which consists in living one’s childhood, once it is said that one has always remained there, in the form of a reinjection of childhood blocs. The problem of desire, in desiring relationships, is indeed: how to make this kind of injection and how to reinject blocs of childhood.\n\nAnd here, I’m thinking back to an author I’ve talked a lot about this year, it’s Kafka. With Kafka, it seems so curious to me how he plays on so many tables at the same time because he has so much humour; sometimes he really makes an inscription of childhood memories: example: the ‘Letter to the Father’; and everyone says: you see how Oedipal he is! But not at all, because he’s doing that for his own personal joke, he is full of joy, he’s ladling on the childhood memories. But when he passes on to another degree both of humour and of seriousness, he doesn’t do that at all, for example in The Castle; that proceeds in a completely different manner, by injecting childhood blocs into adult scenes. The Surveyor in The Castle is constantly traversed by veritable blocs of childhood which are intertwined with things of a completely different kind, and there, there are no longer Oedipal coordinates at all, there are sexual coordinates, homosexual coordinates, there are coordinates of every nature, but it is very different.\n\nMy problem is not only anti-psychoanalytical; it is anti-psychoanalytical in that psychoanalysis contributes with all its might to preventing the production of statements and the production of the unconscious, because the production of statements and production of the unconscious are the same thing. To produce a statement is to produce the unconscious. But it is not only psychoanalysis which prevents the production of statements and the production of the unconscious – once again, the production of the unconscious or the production of statements, we have to call it what it is, it is always a revolution. We can even define the revolutionary period in any domain by this: new statements are produced; and thereby a charge of the unconscious is not released, it is produced. And that this is accompanied by a fantastic release of childhood blocs, in opposition to the memories on which the old system functions, it’s obvious.\n\nAnd today, we had to examine this question of the production of statements as seen through its authors, whom we began to talk about last time. I had just attempted to say how that presented itself in Baudrillard’s case. I’ll just keep this from Baudrillard’s answer, because that’s all I will need today: Baudrillard tells us that what produces statements is a transformation, it’s when exchange-value transforms itself into sign-value. And when this operation is produced, there is a creation of statements, whether these statements are verbal or not verbal. So it is this transformation which is itself productive of statements. In the last instance, we saw that this transformation of exchange-value into sign-value referred to – the sign-value itself referred to – something that was going to make us very sad, namely the splitting of the subject, whether this subject occluded or hid castration, or whether it exhibited it; in other words, we fell back onto the classical thesis which seems to me the thesis of Western, Christian, Cartesian philosophy, etc. Namely that what produces the statement is the subject, and from the fact that it produces the statement, it can only produce it as split into subject of statement and subject of enunciation. The psychoanalytical grain of salt consisting in saying that the splitting is castration, whereas Descartes would have said that all that is reflection … but in any case everywhere it is the subject who is the producer of statements, and it is not by chance that it is the same in Lacan: on the problem of the production of statements, he brings back the cogito. See page 819 of the Écrits, but perhaps it is page 719.[9]\n\nSo, in our study of Baudrillard, we started out gaily saying to ourselves: here’s a thesis on: under what conditions are statements produced? And the beginning of the answer interested us a great deal, namely, what produces statements is the transformation of exchange-value into sign-value. And then, if we were very dejected afterwards, it was insofar as the sign-value referred us to a split subject, therefore to what is simultaneously the most classical and the most psychoanalytic thesis, when the splitting of the subject, on the contrary, is what prevents the production of statements. And it is not by chance that then, on the inverse side, on the other aspect of our problem, which is production of statements = production of the unconscious, Baudrillard, in the same way that he told us that what produced statements is ultimately the split subject, from then on, at the level of the inverse, there was obviously no longer any production of the unconscious, there was nothing more than an unconscious of castration, and the unconscious of the statement was castration itself, namely castration occluded by sign-value. We had so many hopes …\n\nSo then I said to myself that we had to look at things from the side of Jean-Pierre Faye and his two recent books, Théorie du récit [Theory of Narrative] and Langages totalitaires [Totalitarian Languages], because there too, it is indeed the same problem, namely the production of statements or the production of the unconscious.[10] He does not quite put it like that, so I’m in bad faith; because if he does not quite put it like that, it’s because it is perhaps not his problem. What allows me to say that in a way it is his problem is that the whole of Faye’s beautiful book consists in interrogating the condition of the production of statements in a period of history. What I find interesting is how what Faye says is close to Baudrillard – although I shall have to go rather quickly – and how it is very different from him. I can say right away that it is very different, because the answer will not be of the type: what produces the statement is a subject. There will also be – which there is not in Baudrillard – a true transformation in connection with the production of statements. There will be a true transformation – the nature of which I’m not certain about – of the relation of the statement with the unconscious. Therefore, with these two criteria, I can already say that this thesis is all the more interesting to us.\n\nThe first thing which strikes me, truly by chance, because I’m not making a judgment, it’s only impressions: I say to myself that the common point with Baudrillard is that he too starts from exchange. He starts from exchange-value.\n\nSo Faye also starts from exchange, and his own schema – this is what fascinates me in his book and I think it is a very important book: the examples he gives will exceed what he says about them – his problem is how, starting from exchange, the production of statements, which for his part he calls narratives, is made. How are narratives produced starting from exchange? And here, something very curious happens; three texts are very important. First of all, on page 18 of Theory of Narrative, he cites a text by a historian of the 17th or 18th century named Mably[11]; and this is what Mably says in a historical narrative: “Some young Huns were hunting on the banks of the Palus a doe they had chased across a marshland which they regarded as an impassable sea. And, recklessly following their prey, they were astonished to find themselves in a new world. These hunters, eager to tell their families the wonders they had seen, returned to their dwellings, and the narratives through which they aroused the curiosity of their compatriots were to change the face of nations. Never were a people more terrible than Huns.”[12]\n\nFaye’s commentary: “At the beginning and on the right bank of the Rhine, there are the conditions and modes of material production and of exchange.” – So exchange is primary – “Then suddenly – triggering the sudden ‘revolution’ of this crossing of the Rhine – intervenes the unforeseen event of these ‘narratives’ which will ‘change the face of nations’: of this production of supplementary and, so to speak, discontinuous, action, through the effect of narrative”.[13]\n\nWhat strikes me as fascinating is that in the same example what intervenes, as if by chance, is a kind of migratory flow, the Huns; and he does not particularly focus on this, it has the air of being a simple example. We go from the material conditions of exchange to the production of narrative forms, i.e. to the production of statements; the same example allows a factor to intervene which for the moment he does not put into play in his schema, namely the Huns crossing the river, that is to say, a flow of a certain nature. Isn’t this dimension, which is already there in the example, but which he doesn’t make use of, isn’t that enough to explode the pseudo-genesis starting from exchange?\n\nSecond moment of Faye’s thesis: how to account for this, that the conditions of exchange will engender … [Interruption of the recording]\n\n… you see how we remain in exchange. The commodity as “material change” and as belonging to exchange, he says; or on the other hand, the commodity in its form which culminates with what Marx calls, at the beginning of Capital, the “money-form”; or, as Faye says, the commodity as “change of form”. “History begins with this double process: material change [changement] and exchange”, on the one hand, and on the other hand, “change [change] of form.”[14]\n\nIf I compare this with Baudrillard’s schema, he told us that exchange-value is transformed under certain conditions, and that it is sign-value that is productive of statements; here, exchange value or exchange, envisaged in its materiality, is transformed into commodity form. And on that, Faye will draw a whole parallel between the commodity form and the narrative form. Parallel at what level? At this level: that the narrative circulates just as much the commodity, and that it circulates according to rules homologous to those of the commodity, and that a narrative is fundamentally circulatory in the same way as a commodity.\n\nI say to myself that, at the level of this second thesis of Faye, here too we find something both very interesting and very irritating. The general problem of the production of statements was: how does desire, and in what sense does desire make up part of the deepest structures of a social formation, or if you prefer, in more familiar terms, how does desire make up part of the infrastructure itself? Now such a question implies the refusal of any return to a thesis that one could call parallelist or metaphorical, and a metaphoricist or parallelist thesis is indeed the ordinary psychoanalytical thesis. If we admit that the question is well posed, to ask how and under what conditions desire makes up part of the infrastructure itself, any answer which proceeded through a simple parallelism between economic forms and forms of desire, between political economy and desiring economy, therefore which would maintain a dualism and only unite the two through a metaphor or through a parallelism, without showing at all that, on the contrary, desire works on economic structures, that is to say, that there is only a single economy, any restoration of a duality in the economy at the level of a parallelism of a so-called economy and a so-called desiring economy, any establishment of a link between the two, in the form of a metaphor – all that seemed ruinous to us, because it returns to the oldest positions.\n\nNow, Faye is in the process, in turn – when the problem was how to explain that desire had taken on, in a social field, the bizarre forms that emerged with fascism, and thereby how the production of fascist statements in the social field of Germany was constructed at such a moment, which indeed implied a problem of the investment by desire of a whole social historical field – he is in the process of restoring, just like Baudrillard, a simple parallelism between the commodity form and the form of the narrative, or the narrative considered as form of statements.\n\nAll this is because he started, like Baudrillard, from the problem of exchange-value, and that is not possible. If we start from exchange-value, we do not give ourselves the conditions, we will be left wondering how exchange-value transforms itself. Baudrillard’s answer: it transforms itself into sign-value; Faye’s answer: it transforms itself into commodity form, and there is a parallelism between commodity form and narrative form. But, in any case, it is a restoration of a parallelism between the two economies; and one cannot start from exchange-value as production of statements or as a condition for the production of statements, for a very simple reason: there has never been exchange-value.\n\nThe whole operation which consists today in suppressing use-value in the economy, or in carrying its critique as far as possible, in order to find exchange-value as primary in relation to use-value: in what way is it insufficient? Exchange no less than use is said to be second in relation to exchange[15]; exchange is obviously second in relation to something of a completely different nature, namely that exchange implies a kind of flow of communication which can only have the slightest consistency in relation with a completely different flow. In political economy, exchange refers to an aspect of money which is a superficial aspect, or at least a secondary aspect, and the money-form in the commodity very precisely illustrates just that, so that to seek on the side of the commodity form a condition, if only by analogy, for the production of statements is already lost in advance. The money-form refers to money [argent] as purchasing power, and money as purchasing power can be considered as a flow; for example, we will be told today that the flow of wages indeed refers to money as purchasing power, and that is what exchange value is.\n\nAn economy has never functioned like that. An economy, in whatever social formation it may be, can only inscribe exchanges, can only make the circuits of exchange at the basis of money function as purchasing power, as a function of a flow of a wholly different nature. Once again, exchange belongs to arithmetic, it only belongs to the plus and minus, and it clearly appears in this form with Marx, for example when Marx explains how to buy the cheapest and sell the dearest.[16] At the level of money as purchasing power, it always belongs to arithmetic; and furthermore, one of the aspects of the Marxist theory of surplus value still belongs to arithmetic, namely that we pay this to the worker, while he is made to work according to another quantity.\n\nNow an economic field cannot be defined by a simple arithmetic because arithmetic is the homogeneity of quantities and an economic system is based, on the contrary, on a fundamental heterogeneity of quantities, namely – and in particular, it seems obvious to me that Leftism always rediscovers an autonomous problem of power [pouvoir], it’s not like the cretins [missing word – say?], the official and traditional Marxists, it’s not at all because Leftism neglects the importance of so-called economic mechanisms [instances], it’s for a completely different reason. It is not because Leftism would return to a kind of idealism of power: when Foucault is increasingly interested today in the conditions of the exercise of power and when he says that the exercise of power is not a mere tracing of economic structures – and it goes without saying that that does not mean that power falls from the sky, nor does it mean that power is independent of economic structures – then what might that mean today, this rebirth of a specific problem, of a specific problem of power, to the point that, for a certain time, one has recognized as being almost the basic Leftist manifesto, a certain posing of the problem in terms of power. That means that an economic field is never defined arithmetically according to an exchange-value or a form of exchange, because the form of exchange which refers to money as purchasing power [pouvoir d’achat] forms a flow which can only flow in a social field, which can only be exercised in a social field, when put in relation with a flow of another nature.\n\nWhat does that mean, a flow of another nature? The phrase ‘other nature’ has a very rigorous meaning; it means a flow of another power [puissance], namely that the economic operations of a social formation, however simple they appear to us, and even if they appear to us as exchangeist – in parentheses, structuralism is fundamentally exchangeist – the economic operations are carried out under a form of differential relations, and differential relations are not at all A + a or A – a, they are relations of the dy/dx type, which means something very simple: the differential relation is the putting in relation of quantities which are not of the same power, in other words, it always takes at least two flows which are not at the same power, and that’s where money [argent] is to be found. In money in general [argent] or in actual money [monnaie][17], you have a form of power [puissance] I which is money as purchasing power [pouvoir d’achat], and then a form of power [puissance] X, money as structure of financing. In appearance, it is the same money and what makes one believe that it is the same is the existence of a differential relation. But it goes without saying that the structure of financing is not even made with money [argent] that is realizable here and now; and even so all exchange, or all money as purchasing power, presupposes money [monnaie] as structure of financing.\n\nAnd that is what is important in an economic structure like capitalism, it is the duality of the two flows, money as structure of financing, the flow of financing, and the flow of purchasing power – assuming of course that the flow of purchasing power is strictly subordinated as a flow of lesser power to the flow of financing. It is in this sense that one should not think of a powerful man, for example Monsieur Dassault[18], or a banker, as someone who has more money in his wallet than a worker. A banker’s fortune, by definition, is a fortune in the form of a financing structure that is not realizable here and now. It is, literally, a completely different flow with a completely different nature to the flow of purchasing power. His power does not come from a greater purchasing power, his power comes from the fact that he handles and determines the direction of financial flows. He has a power over the flow of purchasing power of his workers, but because, first of all, he is the master of a flow of financing.\n\nSo that taking exchange-value as a starting point in economics is a disaster, since money itself only intervenes in exchange-value, that is to say, gives to the commodity its form, as a function of a flow of a completely different kind; and that if there was not a flow of a completely different sort, then we would understand nothing about anything, starting with problems of power. This is because, from the moment that the economic field, the flow of financing is affected by an infinitely greater power, of a power X, in relation to the flow of purchasing power affected by the power I, this is why I would say that in one case, there are signs of power, whereas in the case of purchasing power, where money serves as means of exchange, what’s involved (and I am using a barbarism) are ‘impotent’ signs. However rich you are, however strong your purchasing power, money as purchasing power defines a set of impotent signs which only receive their power from the other flow, the flow of financing. And just as money as purchasing power is governed by laws of exchange, so is the other flow governed by completely different laws, namely laws of the creation and destruction of money.\n\nThis is why an engendering of the power of statements or of the production of the unconscious starting from the circuit of exchange never works; it is because in fact, this circuit of exchange only intervenes or is only valid in relation to a circuit of a different power which is the circuit of creation-destruction.\n\nThis is what I would say in order to round off this overview and these criticisms – it’s all rather confused – of Faye’s book. When he does precise analyses of the mechanisms of the Nazi economy, there too his example has applications far beyond.\n\nLet us return to the Huns. Faye told us: there is the circuit of exchange, and then there is narrative. A young Hun watched all that happen and came to tell all about it; he said to his friends: yonder, there is money [argent], etc. I’m not necessarily saying that the two flows which come into play to define a production of narrative or a production of statements or a production of the unconscious – I’m not say that these two flows must necessarily be the flow of financing and the flow of purchasing power. I’m saying that, whatever the case, there will be two flows of different powers. It is not by chance that we find ourselves before a nomadic flow, a flow of nomadism in full migration, the Huns, and a flow of a wholly different nature, a flow of exchange which presupposes a certain mobility, but which is found in a given territory, on the other side of the Rhine. It might come across that I’m talking nonsense here, and that’s true, but …\n\nA student: Where do you place the purchase of means of production?\n\nDeleuze: That’s complicated, because the purchase of means of production straddles the two; it will involve both the two flows of different powers. There is indeed a moment when the seller of the means of production is paid. There, there is indeed a conversion into money as purchasing power, and it is necessary. I am not saying at all that the two flows are without relation to each other, since on the contrary, the differential relation puts them in relation. There is always a moment when there is the conversion of a monetary mass, or a creation-destruction of money, with a purchasing power, it is even the problem many economists are posing at the moment: how this conversion is made? So the purchase of means of production does indeed imply money as purchasing power, but the means of production themselves, insofar as they make up part of an enterprise, and insofar as they have only been purchased, for example, as a function of a business capital, of business investments, of a relation between one enterprise and another which brings into play, step by step, the whole of the economy in a social field – that already supposes a structure of financing. This distinction can be expressed in all sorts of ways: I can say that it is the distinction between creation-destruction of money and purchasing power, I can say that it is the distinction that other economists make between capital on the one side, and money [argent] on the other. I can say that we can make the distinction between wage bill [masse salariale] and monetary mass. So for your example of money in its relations with the means of production, I think we would find that the means of production are traversed by the two flows. Perhaps the example of the Nazi economy, about which I would like to say a few words, will make this even clearer.\n\nWhat strikes me is that, in a social formation – if you grant me that it is not arithmetical operations of exchange which establish the variables, but it is differential relations between different quantities of power – on the one hand, power [pouvoir] and the specificity of power is directly grounded on the same thing. If there is a problem of power, and a problem which should not be subordinated to the economy, any more than it should be posed in a simply ideological manner, it comes from this: power consists precisely in the primacy that the flow of a higher power [puissance] has over the flow of a lower power. In other words, to think power [pouvoir] in terms of exchange and what happens starting from exchange value, is an enterprise as stupid as seeking the productions of statements in exchange. In the two examples I’m taking: capitalism, flow of capital under the form of structure of financing, flow of exchange under the form of purchasing power, exchange being second, ie. being the flow of lesser power, the capitalist system constituting the differential relations between the two flows, it is quite obvious that the higher flow of power has at least the character of having its own type of mobility and of determining the limits of the mobility of the other.\n\nCapital has its own mobility. This is even its international character, it is its system of flight, it is the movement of the circulation of capital. The lesser flow of purchasing power which corresponds to the flow, or if you like, of which one of the components is the flow of labor – that has also its mobility. There is a mobility of capital and there is also a mobility of the worker. Now, the capitalist system, economically, is indeed a system which will propose from the beginning to fix the mobility of labor according to the exigencies of the mobility of capital, so that labor and purchasing power do not at all have a mobility which would be their own, but their mobility is strictly measured and regulated by the requirements of the mobility of capital. Therefore, in any economic field, I would not only say that there is a differential relation between at least two quantities of different powers, it will be necessary to say that there is a relation between these quantities, in such a way that the one is not only endowed with a fundamental mobility which one could call, for convenience sake, ‘nomadism’, in the most general sense of the word; but that the other, the impotent quantity, the quantity of lesser power, will only receive mobility as required by the superior quantity of power which, therefore, will encode it, divide it up, prevent it from moving if need be, will oblige it to move according to the requirements of the other quantity if necessary, etc. These are all problems of the 19th century, of how to organise the mobility of labor according to the requirements of capital, i.e. of the mobility of capital itself.\n\nBut what I like is that in Faye’s example, what do we see? We see nomads, the Huns, they cross the Rhine; they themselves are a migrant flow which follows another flow, a hunting flow: following a sheep[19], the little Hun crosses the Rhine, looks around, and then goes and tells his friends what it’s like on the other side of Rhine; and Mably says: never was anything more terrible than when they crossed the Rhine.\n\nIn a completely different domain – for the moment, we are not trying to make a link, we are just seeking an echo – there is this nomadic flow which enters into relation with a flow of exchange: what happens? – In a very recent book by [Georges] Duby, Warriors and Peasants[20], there is something very important for us in the same direction which will act as a junction. The historian Duby explains something similar to this, which takes place at the end of the 10th century. At the end of the 10th century, things are going very badly: it is the period of the decomposition of the Carolingean empire. Money [argent] is no longer backed by the powers [puissances] of financing, by powers of the imperial type. And money is still there, sort of, but as it is never starting from that that you do anything, but since it is the other aspect of money which makes possible the use of money as purchasing power, in the imperial decomposition of Carolingean power, money literally no longer functions at all. Use is made of it in medals and above all, it goes into the monasteries, or it is even put into graves: this is funerary wealth, where it is no longer used as such in exchanges.[21] Exchange then falls back – to speak like Faye – into its material condition, a kind of barter. You see the situation!\n\nAnd then the admirable Vikings arrive at the borders. From the North. From the East arrive the Hungarians. I insist: at the periphery of the system. Duby’s book is written for us: at the periphery of the system the Vikings swoop in with their ships, the Hungarians with their horses, and on their way, they dig up the graves, pillage them and plunder the monasteries. There too, it is a strange flow: a flow of Vikings in ships, a flow of Hungarians on horseback, and Duby explains, in some splendid pages, that it’s them, it’s these savages, who ravage the periphery, who upturn graves, who burn the monasteries, they are the ones who are going to revive the whole economy.[22] Anyway, I’m exaggerating a little, but they are going to be a very important peripheral factor for the relaunching of an economy which was dying. They bring about a kind of release, a liberation of money throughout the whole of Europe, which will reinject into the economy a monetary power that money [monnaie], reduced to its purchasing power or to its exchange-value, had completely lost; they create economic investment through destruction. Here too, you have another example where a flow defined by its superior mobility and power – the power of its horses, of its ships, of its military tactics, etc, will revive a whole [missing word – economy?] as a function of a relation between heterogeneous flows of quantities, of natures, of powers, and I say: whatever the diversity of the examples, you will always find that one of the two flows can be defined as nomadic and mobile, and the other will have to be defined as less mobile and less nomadic, i.e. as receiving its fixity from the exigencies of the other.\n\nIf I follow the example analysed so admirably by Duby, what happens? The peasants soon have had enough of the sight of these Vikings, and astonishing things then start to happen. The roaming Vikings are not just nomads, but they are nomads in the process of migrating. We have the double determination of nomadism, and this represents what we called, in our vocabulary, a flow of nomads that we can characterise by, very profoundly, its deterritorialization. A first deterritorialized flow, but also equally deterritorializing, since they burn the towns when they can (often they do not succeed, but anyway); this flow of nomads is so deterritorializing that they do not even respect the dead, they dig up the earth, they take the silver [argent], carting it off elsewhere; it is therefore a deterritorialized and deterritorializing flow.\n\nAt another corner of the social field, there are the peasants. They find themselves in front of these Vikings and obviously, they flee. That delivers a large blow to the peasants’ residence, that is to say, to the way in which the peasant is attached by the lord to the land. They flee and they are also affected by a coefficient, this time secondary to the deterritorialization, to the point that the problem of power [pouvoir] at that moment is, on the one hand, to organize the struggle against the Vikings or the Hungarians, but also how to stem the peasant deterritorialization. That will then lead in turn, if necessary, to an easing of the peasant situation; it will be necessary to create better situations for the peasants, it will be necessary to bring about, against the double danger, a kind of reterritorialization in all respects, namely: a change in the nature of the towns, which increase in population, since people come to take refuge in the towns; an improvement in the defense of the towns, and then a corresponding gain in autonomy for the towns. At the level of the peasants, very often, a new mode appears in the 10th century involving, instead of attachment to the land, the payment of rents in money [argent] as purchasing power.[23] Why does money as purchasing power come back into the equation? We are referred back to the revival of money, to the injection of money that the Vikings brought about through pillage. These same Vikings, who reinjected money into the economy, noticed rather quickly that with money, they could buy land.\n\nYou see, it is not even enough to say two flows. It would be necessary to distinguish five, six. There is a first flow of power ‘n’, essentially deterritorializing – the Vikings, the Hungarians –, a second deterritorialized flow, the peasants; flows of reterritorialization at the level of the towns; at the level of power [pouvoir]; at the level of the fact that the nomads will make themselves sedentary. All of that will be ways of reterritorializing. And feudalism, as a social formation – I am not saying that this is its only cause, nor even an essential cause – but feudalism as a social formation and the definitive liquidation of the Carolingean empire, it is constituted starting from all these flows of a new type which traverse the social field at a single moment, which confirms a hypothesis we were circling around, namely that new formations are not at all made by accumulation, by a process of aggregation, they are truly made by stampede. When it acts, there is a whole play of flows in a social field, which deterritorialize the old forms of social formations, where reterritorializations of another type are then reforged, and the whole of economic reality is effectively transformed.\n\nTo finish with this point, I would say that, when Faye analyses the Nazi economy, it goes far beyond his schema; his schema dealt with exchange, commodity form, narrative form as a function of statements, because what Faye shows precisely at the level of Nazi economy, is how it functioned on several levels, namely in particular in the case of the problem of the ‘miracle’ of Doctor Schacht in the Nazi economy.[24] This was precisely (roughly): how to construct a structure of financing when one has no purchasing power? An interesting problem, which was linked to the crisis of the collapse of money as purchasing power. What did one see? Of course, the flow of purchasing power is always second in relation to the structures of financing; that does not prevent a well-defined crisis when the structures of financing are completely blocked, for example by unemployment, by the collapse of purchasing power; there are other reasons; but that is one of them. So what will happen? The Nazi paradox, at that moment, is: how to create capital without money … The mechanism of gold would not allow such an attempt (unanchoring in relation to gold), hence how to create capital without purchasing power or how to construct the financing structure without any means of payment, in such a way that this structure of financing that is supposedly created provides means of payment? This is very well analysed in the large book by Faye[25], and what he tries to show is how, in effect, the Nazis proceeded in a very particular manner, precisely insofar as the creditors – they embark on a policy of rearmament – the creditors of the army, the suppliers of the army, draw up bills on an organization [organisme][26] that has a very meagre capital. The discounting of this same organization is re-discounted by the State. This organization is nothing more than an emanation of the Nazi State itself. In other words, a part of the trick is that the State guarantees the debts that it itself makes. This operation in the Nazi economy, during the time of Doctor Schacht, involved about seven different relays …[27]\n\nWhat matters is the time that passes between the issue [of bills] and the injection or the production of the means of purchase; and in that space of time, production itself has increased. And it is this whole trick by which production increases between the issue and the time of putting into circulation, which will permit a whole play between discounting and re-discounting, which will allow a veritable production of capital without any means of purchase; with, at the end of this production of the structure of financing, a return in means of purchase, production having increased. Which implies, in the case of the Nazi economy, not only a war-oriented economy, but what in a sense is more important, that this war-oriented economy is built up in the form of a paradoxical financing, a financing involving the two moments of discounting: the discounting of the organization, or the discounting of the qualified institution, and the re-discounting of the State, with all that allows, namely a whole series of camouflages where the declarations of Doctor Schacht hide this false moment of liberalism, hides an apparent policy of large works, which might disquiet the right and which was borrowed from the Nazi pseudo-left; the policy of large works, in its turn, hides something more profound than it, namely the conversion of the economy into a war economy; the conversion to a war economy itself hides something deeper still: the exact character of the financing of this economy.[28] So, at this level, there are all kinds of production of statements nested one inside the other … [Intermission]\n\nI’ll just remark that in The Archaeology of Knowledge the problem posed is not simply that of the nature of statements. [Foucault] calls a set of statements a discursive formation.[29] Assuming a discursive formation, I believe that one of the points which concerns us most consists in saying: a statement and a discursive formation of which it is part can only be born and can only be formed under the conditions of a multiplicity (even if it means defining what he means by multiplicity). But if we already just stick to this general thesis, namely: it is always a multiplicity which is constitutive of a field or of a domain of statements, in what way does that concern us?\n\nThrough the study of Baudrillard and Faye, it seems to me that we have arrived at a first result: it is not exchange or exchange-value which give the conditions of enunciation; in other words, it is not communication, and if we had to go all the way, that would imply a certain conception of language, namely that language is not communication. And it was said that if the production of statements could not happen starting from exchange-value and the corresponding communication, it was for a very precise reason, namely that, positively, the production of statements implied relations between flows, very different indices of these flows, and relations of a particular type between these flows. That is what we have held onto throughout the examination of Baudrillard and Faye.\n\nAnd now we see that from the beginning of a reading of Foucault, we encounter a notion which might be complementary: a statement in its ‘as such’, that is to say, grasped in its novelty, in its emergence on the interior of a discursive formation, such a phenomenon, such a statement always refers to a multiplicity, because multiplicity, on our account, or more precisely intensive multiplicity, we have come to encounter it as a fundamental phenomenon unfolding or emerging on the body without organs, on bodies without organs of very different types, no less than flows and the relations between flows. Foucault’s whole theme consists in telling us – or in any case in The Archaeology of Knowledge, the problem consists – I am not completely sure about this – in a causality that is productive of statements. If the problem arises for him, it indeed concerns an immanent causality, it is not at all a causality which would be extrinsic, external, it is a question of finding in a discursive formation itself what produces statements; it is therefore a question of a very specific type of causality, and once again, it is not even certain that Foucault would say, at the time of The Archaeology of Knowledge, that such a problem of causality was posed, and the direction in which he goes is to say that statements always have a “correlative space”[30], and he distinguishes three types of spaces linked to the statement. On the one hand, the complementary space enclosed by statements of the same family or of the same discursive formation; in the second place, the correlative space … no, I’m mistaken, in the first place, there is the associated space which is formed by statements of the same family; the correlative space we are going to define because, if there is an immanent causality of the statement, it is perhaps at the level of the correlative space; and third point, the complementary space which consists in the non-discursive formations, institutions, events, in unspecified relation with which the statements, the families of statements, are found.\n\nSo the real problem for us is the correlative space. In very beautiful, very important texts, he takes two examples: statements on delinquency in the 19th century, and statements on clinical anatomy in the 19th century.[31] And what he tries to show is that these statements never refer to a type of object that one could determine as such or such a type, that is to say as one thing; nor do they refer to a type of concept under which one could unify the set of statements of the same family; nor indeed do they refer to any type of sequence. If I stick to the case which seems to me the clearest, that of the objects of statements, that of the objects upon which statements bear, he tries to show how these objects upon which one or several statements bear, are not one, but are organized in what he calls a space of dispersion …\n\nHenri Gobard: It is better not to go any further because the whole of this discourse is going over the heads of those who think that the UV [final course credit] is a permanent cinema. You offer yourself up as an object of consumption, etc., etc.\n\nDeleuze: In what way is it a permanent cinema?\n\nGobard: [Indistinct sentences][32]\n\nDeleuze: It’s true that this morning, it had a distinctly ‘Club Mediterranean’ feel. What to do?\n\nGobard: We have to give the tourists a voice so that they too can produce statements.\n\n[Nobody says anything]\n\nDeleuze: Something true is said there … Since no one has anything to say, I’ll be off then. [End of the session]\n\nNotes\n\n[1] The psychoanalytic institutional body founded in 1964 by Jacques Lacan.\n\n[2] A unique reference to René Girard, who is not discussed in any of Deleuze’s published works. Deleuze appears to be referring to Girard’s theory of mimetic desire, as developed in Deceit, Desire and the Novel (translated by Yvonne Freccero, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1965 [1961]) and Violence and the Sacred (translated by Patrick Gregory, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977 [1972]).\n\n[3] Cf. Deleuze and Guattari, ‘Interview on Anti-Oedipus with Raymond Bellour’ (1973): “There is a guy who wrote to me with a typical example of what Félix just cited as a psychoanalytical interpretation. The guy told his analyst that he wanted to go to a hippie group in India, he wanted to get the hell out, and the analyst responded immediately: ‘Hippie group is big pippee, you see how it’s always your theme of impotence’.” Translated by Ames Hodges in Deleuze, Letters and Other Texts (South Pasadena: Semiotext(e), 2020), p. 197.\n\n[4] The word actuels could be translated as ‘contemporary’, but as the context suggests, the term has a particular history within psychoanalytic theory. See the entry ‘Actual Neurosis’, in Jean Laplanche and Jean-Bertrand Pontalis, The Language of Psychoanalysis (translated by Donald Nicholson-Smith, London: Karnac Books, 1988 [1967]), pp. 10-12. For Wilhelm Reich’s re-evaluation of the role of the ‘actual’ in neurosis, see The Function of the Orgasm (translated by Theodore P. Wolfe, London: Panther, 1968), pp. 101-108.\n\n[5] See Henri Bergson, ‘Memory of the Present and False Recognition’, in Mind-Energy (translated by H. Wildon Carr, London: Macmillan, 1920 [1919]), p. 128-130. Deleuze discusses this conception in Bergsonism (translated by Hugh Tomlinson and Barbara Habberjam, New York: Zone Books, 1988 [1966]), pp. 58-59, 125 n. 15; cf. also Difference and Repetition (translated by Paul Patton, London: Athlone, 1995 [1968]), pp. 81-82.\n\n[6] Bergson, ‘Memory of the Present and False Recognition’, p. 130: “Either the present leaves no trace in memory, or it is twofold at every moment, its very up-rush being in two jets exactly symmetrical, one of which falls back towards the past, whilst the other springs forward towards the future.” Deleuze gives a figurative representation of this ‘schema’ in Cinema 2: The Time-Image (translated by Hugh Tomlinson and Robert Galeta, Minneapolis; University of Minneapolis, 1989 [1985]), p. 295 n. 23, but notes that Bergson himself does not present a figure of the schema.\n\n[7] The missing word would be récit. See footnote 8 below.\n\n[8] Pierre Janet’s theory of narrative [le récit] is developed in L’Évolution de la mémoire et de la notion du temps [The Evolution of Memory and the Notion of Time] (Paris: Chahine, 1928).\n\n[9] There is a reference to the cogito in Lacan, ‘The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire’, Écrits, (translated by Bruce Fink et al., New York: W.W. Norton, 2006 [1966]), p. 819 (French pagination).\n\n[10] Jean Pierre Faye, Langages totalitaires (Paris: Hermann, 1972); Théorie du récit [Theory of Narrative], subtitled Introduction aux ‘Langages totalitaires’ (Paris: Hermann, 1972). Cf. also La Critique du langage et son économie [The Critique of Language and its Economy] (Paris: Galilée, 1973). These works are cited in A Thousand Plateaus (translated by Brian Massumi, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988 [1980]), pp. 82, 139, 231, 536 n. 11, 570, n. 62. None of these works is translated into English. For a concise introduction to Faye’s work, see John B. Thompson, Studies in the Theory of Ideology (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1984), Chapter 6, ‘Narratives of National Socialism: An Analysis of the Work of Jean Pierre Faye’, pp. 205-231.\n\n[11] Gabriel Bonnot de Mably (1709-1785). The first section of the opening chapter on ‘Narration’ in Faye’s Théorie du récit is entitled ‘The Mably Effect,’ and is based on a reading of Mably’s Observations sur l’Histoire de France, 1765 (2nd edition, 1788).\n\n[12] Deleuze quotes the first sentence (taken from Mably’s Observations, cited in Faye, Théorie du récit, pp. 18-19) slightly inaccurately; an English rendering of the sentence might read: “Some young Huns were hunting on the banks of the Maeotian swamp [Palus Méotides]; a doe they had been chasing crossed a marshland which they regarded as an impassable sea.”\n\n[13] Faye, Théorie du récit, p. 19.\n\n[14] Faye, Théorie du récit, p. 21: “History begins with this double process: material change and exchange, or change of form.” Faye is commenting on the following passage in Marx’s Capital: “Wir haben also den ganzen Prozess nach der Formseite zu betrachten, also nur den Formwechsel oder die Metamorphose der Waren, welche den gesellschaftlichen Stoffwechsel vermittelt.” [“We therefore have to consider the whole process in its formal aspect; that is to say, the change in form or the metamorphosis of commodities through which the social metabolism is mediated.” (Capital, Vol. I, translated by Ben Fowkes, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1990 [1867], pp. 198-199)]. Faye cites the French translation “changement matériel dans la société” for “gesellschaftlichen Stoffwechsel” (“social metabolism”).\n\n[15] L’échange non moins que l’usage est dit second par rapport à l’échange. This clause lacks sense, but the ensuing clause makes clear that exchange is in turn “second” in relation to the flow of financing. Sense can be restored by ignoring the words “par rapport à l’échange” [“in relation to exchange”].\n\n[16] Cf. Marx, Capital, Vol. I, Part Two, ‘The Transformation of Money into Capital’, pp. 247-280.\n\n[17] In the Second Seminar on Anti-Oedipus, Session 4, footnote 37, it was noted that Deleuze seems to use argent as a neutral term for money, and to specify two forms of monnaie: money as financing structure and money as means of payment. Therefore the present slightly augmented translation seems more acceptable than the literal but absurd translation “money [argent] or money [monnaie].”\n\n[18] Marcel Dassault (1892-1986), engineer, industrialist and founder, in 1952, of the Banque commerciale de Paris.\n\n[19] Deleuze correctly stated earlier that it was a doe, not a sheep.\n\n[20] Georges Duby, Guerriers et paysans (Paris: Gallimard, 1973), translated as The Early Growth of the European Economy: Warriors and Peasants from the Seventh to the Twelfth Century (translated by Howard B. Clarke, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1974). Cited in A Thousand Plateaus, p. 537, n. 19.\n\n[21] Argent, of course, means ‘silver’ as well as ‘money’.\n\n[22] Duby, The Early Growth of the European Economy, pp. 115-120.\n\n[23] Duby, The Early Growth of the European Economy, pp. 117-118: “As they fled from Vikings, Saracens or Hungarians, many slaves and dependants took the opportunity to break the bonds tying them to their lords. They settled elsewhere in the service of new lords, ones who treated them as free men and exploited them less harshly. For in order to repopulate their estates with workers, big landowners were probably forced to make the system of rents and services more flexible. […] Compulsory labor services had already been replaced by money rents […]”.\n\n[24] Hjalmar Schacht was the president of the German Central Bank in the first years of Nazi rule. Faye talks of the Nazi “financial miracle” in Théorie du récit, p. 9, and in Langages totalitaires, pp. 666, 670.\n\n[25] See Faye, Langages totalitaires, pp. 659-683.\n\n[26] The ‘organization’ was a limited liability company, Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft (‘Mefo’ for short), set up by Schacht solely to issue bills of exchange to arms manufacturers. Faye cites Schacht’s description: “Mefo papers are bills, drawn generally by the suppliers of the Army […] on a company Metallforschung G.m.b.H. endowed with a reduced capital, and whose rediscounting by the Reichsbank was guaranteed by the Reich” (cited in Langages totalitaires, p. 665). Faye analyses the “paradoxical” nature of the Mefo bills on pp. 665-667.\n\n[27] “Seven relays” between the Reichsbank and the arms manufacturers, without any redemption of the bills (in order to avoid inflation) were necessary in order “to allow, between the initial moment of issue and its final afflux in effective monetary circulation, for the interposition of the time of development, of production” (Faye, Langages totalitaires, p. 674).\n\n[28] Schacht publicly criticised the proposed policy of “German Keynesians” (Faye, Langages totalitaires, p. 670) to introduce “large works” (ibid, 664), or public work programmes, while keeping the programme of Mefo bills secret or “masked” (Théorie du récit, pp. 44-46; Langages totalitaires, pp. 662, 665).\n\n[29] See Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge (translated by A.M.

Stivale\n\nTranslation: Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni\n\n \n\nAbout little Hans[1]\n\n… even in terms of little Hans’ relationship with the horse, we will see a number of responses that will consist in saying that the relation is analogical, or else responses that would amount to saying that the relationship is homological and that we must establish the structural system that accounts for this. We, on the contrary, will go in a completely different direction by speaking of a machinic assemblage[2] that excludes both imaginary analogies and structural homologies.\n\nI would add that we are far from being done with this business of the internal contract in psychoanalysis, because if Melanie Klein announced the move, “I exchange your affects for fantasies”, and that this was a way of breaking the child and of preventing him from producing his own utterances or from bringing forth his unconscious, a move even worse than that of Freud, now we have a third phase. They have found another way: I take a recent book by André Green called L’enfant de ça[3] which is very interesting in this respect because Green asks: what is it that has been lacking in psychoanalysis? What has been lacking in psychoanalysis is a theory of thought, and he says: in the end, I, Andre Green, consider myself a disciple of Wilfred Bion – an English psychoanalyst – rather than of Lacan, because Bion is the first to have come up with a psychoanalytical theory of thought… but to know what this psychoanalytic theory of thought consists in, you have to read Green’s texts.\n\nAnd he says very eloquently that the real psychoanalytic exchange would be “you give me your affects, and in return I will give you thought”. The psychoanalyst assumes the role of thinker, and what happens when the psychoanalyst assumes the role of thinker can hardly be believed: the hour of the cogito makes its return. It has returned under the name of holy castration. The current state of the analytic exchange is no longer: “you give me your affects, and I’ll give you perception”, or “you give me your affects, and I’ll give you fantasy”, now it’s – and note the Kleinian nonsense of this – give me your affects and take care of your own fantasies, that is to say, of a theater. And it’s no trouble for anyone to set up a little theatre in the corner, as long as it doesn’t burn down your school. That’s what an affect is, it’s a fire! Melanie’s famous ideal amounts to the same thing: we find ourselves faced with these little paranoiacs and a child who experiences his body-machine… who experiences it as a power, a potency, that is to say that he is indeed a little paranoiac. But there’s nothing wrong with these little paranoiacs, they’re not bad people. All they want is for the machine to work. They are even very ingenious; a little paranoiac isn’t sick, they have no need of anyone.\n\nAnd what does Melanie Klein want? Her great battle cry is: I will make you pass from the paranoid position to the depressive position – I’m not making this up – she constructs a whole theory so as to show the superiority of the depressive position, which attains the sacred unity of the ego with the good object and so on, all that crap, considering the culture of fantasy as a particularly life-enhancing thing. This is the good position, the depressive position: we have broken the little paranoiac. And this is considered a successful cure. I still have a vivid memory of Lacan’s texts where he speaks about didactic psychoanalysis and where he says that intensive psychoanalysis is that which must pass through the depressive position.\n\nNow the objections that Green makes, and it is not by chance that Mr. Green objects to me, saying: “you never talk about depressives; you don’t know what a depressive is”.[4] This is precisely his whole trick: to transform a kind of paranoid potency into a depressive impotence that it is at one with the exchange: affects-forces replaced by fantasies, or programs replaced by fantasies, and meanwhile the little guy is in his corner, not saying anything, that is, he is unable to produce his utterances.\n\nWe had left it at this, an extraordinary operation: little Hans in a vital way — in a vital way, quite independently of what the psychoanalysts say about it — little Hans describes the horse, and we don’t ask ourselves what this description of the horse signifies, we don’t take it as the object of an interpretation to be made. We just noticed last time that this description consisted of an enumeration of affects, and that these affects did not refer to the horse defined as an organism, to the horse such as a naturalist or a biologist might define it, but that it referred to the horse as a part or as a cog of a machinic assemblage, the assemblage in question being: horse-cariole-weight-driver of the horse.\n\nAnd it was within the framework of this machinic assemblage that the affects by which little Hans not only described, but experienced the horse were distributed. I say “experienced” because he was launching himself into a kind of becoming-horse, in terms of a becoming-animal. This is a very curious or paradoxical operation, the temptation or the attempt to define or describe something or someone by the affects they supposedly experience. The question we will begin with today is: what does such an attempt mean? What does it imply? Because, after all, it is hardly self-evident. What would it mean logically or not logically? What is this way of living things, animals or persons according to the affects we lend them? What is it opposed to? What is little Hans trying to get across by this method? What is he trying to resist? To resist the oppression that comes from the family, the oppression that comes from the street and the city, the oppression that comes from psychotherapists, and this attempt by little Hans to maintain… no, no, the horse is a set of affects considered in terms of a machinic assemblage.\n\nFor us, this is very important because it already gives us the feeling that between an affect and a machinic assemblage, there is a relation, but which is not at all the same as the relation there is between organic determinations and an organism; that is something else altogether. So, what is it that he wants to assert and that psychoanalysis prevents him from so doing? It contains a description of things, of beings and of animals in terms of affects. He is looking for something, what he wants is something that is inseparable from a becoming-horse. This engages us already a little: the fact that the affect is inseparable from a becoming, the affect is inseparable from a passage. To what does a descriptive thought by affects oppose itself? But here we should proceed very much in order…\n\nAndré Scala: There is a very important text, because it contains everything we need to know about Freud’s method, it’s on page 98 of “Little Hans”, note 3. Following a reflection by little Hans on the way little girls make pee-pee, little Hans says that little girls have a pee-pee maker because they make pee-pee. Freud says that one could be disturbed by this early alteration of the childish intellect. Why don’t these investigators affirm what they actually see, which is that little girls don’t have a pee-pee maker. So why doesn’t Hans himself ask this question? We can say that Hans links the pee-pee maker, not to a form or function, but to a functioning, to a machinic assemblage, which means, he says, that everything has a pee-pee maker except chairs or tables. A locomotive has a pee-pee maker, a cow has one, a horse, the father, the mother. One can ask the question: if little girls do not have a pee-pee maker, how do they pee? Freud answers that this is not the question, it is only of secondary importance; peeing is secondary to the pee-pee maker. We will see in Hans’ experiments, when he holds himself back from urinating, that this is perhaps how one can know if it’s possible to pee through another organ. There is a first stage of organ analogies, that is to say that Freud replies that yes, little girls do pee but it happens differently. It’s a bit like fish who have gills and men who have lungs, they both breathe but they don’t breathe in the same way and the organs – gills-lungs, little girl-little boy – these are organs called analogues. That’s the first thing.\n\nSecondly, Freud makes little Hans say: I want to have a pee-pee maker as big as a horse’s. There doesn’t seem to be a text where Hans actually says: I want a pee-pee maker as big as a horse’s. He never says this because for him the horse is not a goal, it’s a becoming. The second thing is Freud’s assignment of the becoming-horse, in terms of transcendence, that is to say that the horse is obviously bigger than little Hans. It has a penis that is much, much larger than that of little Hans, and this will allow Freud, by way of the obvious, to introduce the element of phobia. Of course, in the experimentation, in the becoming-horse, there is fear and anguish, but there is never phobia in terms of confrontation with a model.\n\nAnd here we have the third reversal concerning Freud’s erroneous perception: Freud says that the erroneous perception of little Hans is, finally, the work of his unconscious. He says that he guesses that little girls have a pee-pee maker in the form of the clitoris, and this is the moment of structural homology. The clitoris-penis homology exceeds the analogy of function. We should see these three stages and how Freud, through these three moments – analogy, eminence, and homology – how he closes the loop of erroneous perception, unconscious, and how this circuit is that of Freud’s analysis and how he short-circuits the affects and injects phobia.\n\nDeleuze: If I understand correctly, there is a point that touches on psychoanalysis in its most fundamental domain, and this concerns the problem of the difference of the sexes. According to what Scala has said, it is very striking that as soon as psychoanalysis gets involved in thinking about the problem of the difference of the sexes, it does so by borrowing modes of thought that are logically easy to inventory, namely, either the large analogy of perception, what we can call the learned analogy or the homology that we would now call structural. A typical example in psychoanalysis is where little Hans says, sometimes in the form of questions, sometimes in the form of assertions… he says that girls, too, have a pee-pee maker. This is one of little Hans’ propositions, which perhaps involves many things. But what we notice is the way that in the psychoanalysis of a child an idea is already crushed because what Hans hears is precisely this: I know that they don’t have one, but they have it by analogy. Last time we saw the famous analogy Freud proposes between the penis and the clitoris. And immediately, Freud says: why does he want to maintain that little girls have a pee-pee maker, if only by analogy? It is because of his fear of castration.\n\nIn my view, in everything that little Hans said, there is nothing that in any way, shape or form, indicates this, absolutely nothing. It’s all in Freud’s head. It is Freud who believes that little girls do not have a pee-pee maker and that, if they have one, it can only be by analogy. Therefore, female sexuality is conceived by way of analogy with male sexuality. Freud’s position is well known; basically, it is that there is only one sexuality, the sexuality of the boy, whereas feminine sexuality is indeed a sexuality by analogy. When, with Melanie Klein, psychoanalysis began to lean in a slightly more progressive direction in this domain, it consisted in saying: yes, finally, there are two sexualities, a male sexuality and a female sexuality. So at that point, between the two sexualities, what relation could there be? No longer a relation of rough analogy, but a relation of so-called structural homology, as if there were homology between two structures.\n\nNow, following Scala’s remark, the problem has arisen of this perpetual procedure of thinking sexuality in terms of analogy or homology. We’ll look at this, and we’ll just keep it in mind for now. Perhaps little Hans thinks in a different way; perhaps the thought processes of little Hans are completely different, which is why he will never be able to say what he has to say because from the beginning, his thought is molded in terms of schemas and processes that have nothing to do with him.\n\nWhere will this business of analogies and homologies lead us? You understand, if we are looking for what is truly original or creative in statements, we rediscover our initial question: what is original in an attempt to define things, beings or animals in terms of affects and not through anything else? Now, as for the affects of the horse, we have made a list of these and we have seen what assemblage they fit into. Suppose I say that between a table, a horse, a dog, a girl, a boy, the differences consist only in the fact that they are not affected by the same things. In other words, these differences are always… they always concern powers of being affected. This may not seem very important, but oddly, things, animals and people already tend to lose their form. Everything still functions if I’m told that a dog is a mammal, that it has four legs, that it barks, whereas a horse is something else… well. But we enter a completely different atmosphere if we say that what really counts are the affects of which someone or something is capable.\n\nHere, we venture into an unknown forest where things are distinguished only by the affects of which they are capable. Already, we are forced to go beyond the simple notion of affect. We go beyond the notion of affect by means of a more precise notion: the power of being affected. To be affected is a power. So, we define things, beings, animals, by powers. We can immediately at least see to what other kinds of scenarios this is opposed: we no longer define them by or in terms of genera or species. I would not say that a table is a manufactured thing, whereas a horse is an animal, just as I would not ask whether a person is male or female, but rather I would ask, what affects are you capable of? That is to say, what are your powers of being affected? In terms of a certain very, very simple way of thinking, it is perhaps here that we will see the most bizarre things happening: what is the meaning of this power of being affected?\n\nSo the list of horse-affects that little Hans drew up as his experience went on, you remember, whether it was kicking, having hindquarters, being an anal animal, that is, making dung, pulling carts, pulling overweight carts, falling under excessive weight, all of thi defines the horse’s power of being affected.\n\nA student: In industry, in transportation, we use this term: assignment. You can be assigned to or deassigned from something: such and such a locomotive is assigned to transport goods. I don’t know if we can talk about powers; it’s more a question of efficiency rather than powers.\n\nDeleuze: Well, what does it mean to be disaffected? To be disaffected, that is to say, no longer to be affected in the order of certain affects.\n\nThe student: An affect is something that is free, that is susceptible to being affected in different ways, free in the sense that Freud speaks of free energy that can oscillate between various poles, whereas in practice it is something more determining. We would need to find something which allows us to pass from the affect to something more precise, but more free. To pass from the affect in the machinic assemblage… which would be embodied in something individualized…\n\nAnother student: When you say that energy is embodied, it doesn’t work anymore. An affect already constitutes a system in a certain sense.  There are no free affects. You don’t do anything with oil, for example. You don’t do anything with water, which is to say that each affect is already something affected…\n\nDeleuze: Thanks to what you two have said, we have now a group of notions: affects, assignments of function and powers.\n\nRichard Pinhas: What I liked very much in the little text that André read, and in the commentary that he made, is that it very clearly shows an operation that is at the same time that of psychoanalysis – it pertains to psychoanalysis in the sense that it’s part of the contract – and that also pertains more or less to capital, but only to a certain extent and in another manner. And the whole process that we see at work in Freud’s analysis of little Hans is this transformation, which is practically a real transmutation of intensities into intentions, intentions that will play the role of simulacra of intensities. And these intensities, finally, we can put them in conjunction with the notion of affect, in a certain way. It’s a bit adventurous, but I see it as a kind of qualification of the quantitative.\n\nIn other words, I would see the affect as a point, as a point that we would take in a chain – but the chain is a crude metaphor – that we would take in a flow – this is already less metaphorical – and a point that would note, that would denote or rather designate a variation and a fluctuation of intensities, in other words a rise or a fall, whatever you want to call it, you can call it anything you like, and that’s why in the affect we would only have singular positions and we would have no link …\n\nDeleuze: Yes, but in these variations and fluctuations, we should also see thresholds, thresholds to cross.\n\n A student: [Inaudible remarks].\n\nPinhas: I was talking about the passage from intensity to intention. If I try to define the intensity-affects pole, what we have is a pole that is composed of singularities, whereas in intention, that is to say in the simulacra of intensities, in the simulacra of affects, in the simulacrum of identity or in this identity that capital makes for you, in this kind of organic body that capital makes for you, we are in a completely different sphere: we are in that of exchange. What I liked is that in the very nature of affect, and on the side of intensities, we have a kind of plane where there are only metamorphic processes. We pass from one affect to another without causes, without reasons, without goals. It happens and it happens as a pure process. Whereas on the side of the intention, we would have something that could be called fixity. We have what Freud is trying to do, that is to say fix desire, something that does not flow anymore, that no longer metamorphoses.\n\nAnd the whole of Freud’s operation, finally, will be to identify the affective moments, the moments in the sense of affective powers, and to fix these powers in order to precisely exchange them in a movement that we saw last week: namely, to make this exchange: you give me your affects, I give you words. Finally, it is this process that, through the intermediary of simulacra, representations, images, will make your symptom disappear. I believe that there is something extremely important in this consideration of affect as a purely metamorphic process as opposed to a kind of fixity that the desire of psychoanalysis wants to impose at all costs.\n\nA student: We have not yet put enough emphasis – and I realize that part of your intervention fits into this – on potential energy as something profoundly discontinuous that is capable of both gradual fluctuations and jumps, discontinuities, thresholds, very rapid passages. At the level of potential energy, for example, there cannot be something like an equalization, there will be a very abrupt passage where we pass … [Inaudible remarks] [End of recording]\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Right from the first plateau of A Thousand Plateaus, “Rhizome: introduction”, Deleuze and Guattari are greatly concerned with the figure of Freud’s “Little Hans”.  See p. 13 on Melanie Klein’s “Little Richard”; see also the collective text (with Guattari, Claire Parnet, and André Scala) “The Interpretation of Utterances”, in Two Regimes of Madness: texts and interviews 1975-1995, trans.

Purdue University Research Repository. doi:10.4231/23T0-NM63\n\n\n\n\nGilles Deleuze\n\nSeminar on Anti-Oedipus III, 1973-1974\n\nLecture 02, 14 January 1974\n\nTranscribed by WebDeleuze; transcription modified, Charles J. Stivale\n\nTranslated by Timothy S. Murphy\n\nThe Univocity of Being\n\nI must pass through a kind of terminological detour. This detour consists in recalling a certain terminology. We find that, in the whole current of the Middle Ages up to and including the seventeenth century, a certain problem is posed concerning the nature of being. And this problem concerning the nature of being adopted some very precise notions: equivocity, analogy, univocity.\n\nAt first sight these terms appear dead to us. They make up part of the great discussions of Scholasticism, but the great metaphysical disputes always hide something else: people are never burned or tortured over ideological questions, even less over metaphysical ones. I would like for us to try to feel what was very concretely in question in these stories which were presented under an abstract form: is being equivocal, is it analogical, is it univocal? And after all, this is not because today, except among the seminarians, we have abandoned these terms, not because we do not continue to think in them and through them.\n\nI would like to content myself with very simple definitions. There are people who said: being is equivocal. They argued, they burned one another for things like that. But “being is equivocal” meant a precise thing: being is said in several senses. That means: being is said in several senses of that of which it is said. That is to say that the implication [sous-entendu] of the proposition was already: being is said of something. I’m not even interested in knowing if it’s an ontological problem; it’s a problem of utterances [énoncés] as well. Being is stated [s’énonce] in several senses of that of which it is stated. Concretely, what does that mean? One assumes that a table is not in the same manner as an animal and that an animal is not in the same manner as a man; that a man is not in the same manner as God. Therefore there are several senses of being.\n\nThose who were called the partisans of equivocity, no matter who they were, argued a very simple thing: that the different senses of the word “being” were without common measure and that, in all rigor—and what is interesting in theology are always the limit points at which heresy peeks out—in every doctrine one can always locate the exact point where, if the person says a word more, that’s it, the machine is set in motion, one starts a process. That runs through the whole history of the Middle Ages, it’s very interesting because it’s an actual struggle of an obviously political nature.\n\nWell then, the heretical point of equivocity is that those who said that being is said in several senses, and that these different senses have no common measure, understood that at the limit they would have preferred to say: “God is not,” rather than to say “He is” to the extent that “He is” was a utterance which was said of the table or the chair. Or else He is in a such an equivocal manner, such a different manner, without common measure with the being of the chair, with the being of man, etc… that, all things considered, it’s much better to say: He is not, which means: He is superior to being. But if they had a sense of wordplay this became very dangerous, it sufficed that they insist only a little on “God is not,” if they were discreet they said “God is superior to being,” but if they said “God is not,” that could turn out badly. Broadly speaking they were partisans of what is called the equivocity of being.\n\nThen there were those who were partisans of the Univocity of being. They risked even more because what does this mean, univocity, in opposition to the equivocity of being? And all the treatises of the Middle Ages are filled with long chapters on the univocity or equivocity of being, it’s very interesting. But those who said that being is univocal, supposing that they had done so and were not immediately burned, what did that mean? That meant: being has only one sense and is said in one and the same sense of everything of which it is said. Here one feels that if the equivocists already had such a possible sin in themselves, the univocists were thinkers who told us: of everything which is, being is said in one and the same sense—of a chair, of an animal, of a man or of God. Yet again, I’m simplifying everything because perhaps they didn’t dare go that far, perhaps there’s only a single thinker who would have gone that far, perhaps none, but in the end there is this idea.\n\nAnd then inevitably there are those who were between the two, between the univocists and the equivocists. Those who are between the two are always those who establish what we call orthodoxy. These people said that being is not univocal because it’s a scandal; to claim that being is said in one and the same sense of God and of the flea is a terrible thing, we must burn people like that; and then those who say “being is said in several senses which have no common measure,” we no longer know where we are with them: there is no order anymore, there’s no longer anything. Thus these third people said: being is neither equivocal nor univocal, it’s analogical. Here we can say the name, the one who elaborated a theory of analogy on the basis of Aristotle, Saint Thomas, and historically he won. Being which is analogical meant: yes, being is said in several senses of that of which it is said. Only these senses are not without common measure: these senses are governed by relations of analogy. Thus the equivocity of being, the univocity of being, the analogy of being, you’re going to ask me where all this leads us?\n\nSo what does this mean: being is said in several senses of that of which it is said? And these senses are not without common measure, they have an analogical measure. Well then, in Saint Thomas’ theses, which I am simplifying a lot, this means two things, because analogy, which is taken here in a technical or scientific sense, analogy was double, in any case taken in a technical or scientific sense, that is to say that it was not a question of common analogy. Common analogy is simple similarity of perception: something is analogous to something else. If you like it’s the similarity of perception or the analogy of imagination, generally speaking. Scientific or technical analogy, the analogy of concepts, is double: the first sense was termed by Saint Thomas “analogy of proportions” and the second was termed by Saint Thomas “analogy of proportionality.”\n\nThe analogy of proportion was the following: being is said in several senses and these senses are not without common measure, they have an internal measure, they have a conceptual measure, they have a measure in the concept. Why? Well, in the first sense of the analogy of proportion, that meant—because there’s a primary sense of the word “being” and then derived senses—the primary sense of the word “being” was what’s often translated by the term “substance” or sometimes by the term “essence.” The other senses of the word “being” were the different senses of the word “being” which were derived from the primary sense following a law of proportion. Thus being was said in several senses, but there was a primary sense from which the others were derived.\n\nThis has hardly carried us forward because the primary substance was not univocal, it wasn’t said in a single sense. At the level of substance in its turn there were going to be analogies, namely: substance was said in several analogical senses, and of that which was substance it was necessary to say that certain substances were primary in relation to others, which were not substance in the same sense. For example, the so-called “incorruptible” substances were primary in relation to the perishable substances. Thus the analogy of proportion consisted in setting out a plurality of hierarchized and methodical senses on the basis of a sense that was assumed to be primary. This was the analogy of proportion.\n\nAnd then the second form of scientific analogy, which was not opposed to the first, this was the analogy of proportionality, which consisted this time in a figure quite close to its equivalent, mathematical analogy: A is to B as C is to D. Example given by Saint Thomas: God is good. Following the analogy of proportion: God is good and man is good; following the analogy of proportion God is formally good, that is to say possessing in Himself goodness in the plenitude of this quality, and man is only good by derivation insofar as he is a creature of God, thus man is secondarily good. This is the analogy of proportion. The analogy of proportionality is the same example, but you must sense how it changes. What infinite goodness is to God, finite goodness is to man.\n\nI would add, to finish with this: yet again do we not continue to think theologically? To this whole group of notions, analogy, analogy of proportion, analogy of proportionality, was linked a very precise notion which was that of category. In what way did the categories make up part of the analogical vision or the analogical conception? For example, the categories, common to Aristotle and much later to Kant, let’s put down substance, quantity, etc. Why categories and not concepts? What difference is there between the concept of causality or quantity and the concept of lion? Quite simple: every thing, all that is not [connected?], alternatively everything that is substance, has a quality, a quantity, etc. Hence the very strict definition of what must be called a category: one calls categories the concepts which are said of every possible object of experience. Lion is not a category because you cannot say “lion” of every possible object of experience. On the other hand, every possible object of experience has a cause and is itself cause of other things. There, that clarifies everything. The categories, thus defined, are strictly inseparable from an analogical conception; one calls categories the concepts which are said of every possible object of experience, or what amounts strictly to the same thing: the different senses of the word “being.” And the categories in Aristotle are presented as the different senses of the word “being,” exactly as in Kant the categories are defined as the concepts which are said of every possible object of experience. Therefore there’s no question of a thought proceeding by categories if it does not have, as background, the idea that being is analogical, which is to say that being is said of what is in an analogical manner.\n\nAt this point I make a leap: what appears to me the strangest thought, the most difficult to think, if it has ever been thought, is univocity. Suppose someone arrives there, in an assembly of priests, or even here and says: being is said absolutely in one and the same sense of everything of which it is said. One could say that this does not go very far, but this means precisely that being is univocal, that is to say neither analogical nor equivocal—and understand well that in the Middle Ages those sorts were very up-to-date on all this, as you are—if someone happened by speaking of univocity of being, he was quickly spotted, he could pack his bags; that meant, yet again, that a chair, an animal, a man and God are in one and the same sense. Then what: you treat God as matter? Are a dog and a man in the same sense? Quite tricky, that.\n\nAnd nevertheless there is a man, the greatest thinker of the Middle Ages, who says yes, being is univocal, that is Duns Scotus. This story of Duns Scotus’ univocal being turns out rather badly—but happily he took precautions, he said yes but be careful: being is univocal insofar as it is being. That is to say that it’s metaphysically univocal. He said: sure it’s analogical, which is to say that it’s said in several senses physically. This is what interests me: he was at the border of heresy, had he not specified metaphysically univocal and physically analogical, he would have been done for. But for Duns Scotus’ disciples, less prudent than he was, it turned out badly. Because I say: being is univocal, this means there is no categorical difference between the assumed senses of the word “being” and being is said in one and the same sense of everything which is. In a certain manner this means that the tick is God; there is no difference of category, there is no difference of substance, there is no difference of form. It becomes a mad [démente] thought.\n\nMy question is, if I say being is univocal, it’s said in the same sense of everything of which it’s said, then what could the differences between [beings?] be? They can no longer be differences of category, they can no longer be differences of form, they can no longer be differences of genus and species. And why can they no longer be all that? Because, once again, if I say: the differences between beings are differences of form, are formal, generic, specific differences, at that moment I cannot escape from the analogy of being for this simple reason: the categories are the ultimate genera of being. If I say: there are several senses of the word “being” which are precisely the categories, I must say that what is, that of which I say, “this is,” is distinguished by the form, the species, the genus. On the other hand, if I say that being is univocal and that it’s said in one and the same sense of everything of which it’s said, I fall into that which becomes the mad thought, the thought of infamy, the thought of the formless, the thought of the non-specific, the thought of the non-generic.\n\nThe only means of getting out of this is to say: of course there are differences between beings, and in any case being is said in one and the same sense of everything which is. Then what do the differences between beings consist in? The only difference conceivable at this very moment, from the point of view of a univocal being, is obviously difference solely as degrees of power [puissance]. Beings are not distinguished by their form, their genus, their species, that’s secondary; everything which is refers to a degree of power.\n\nWhy is the idea of degrees of power fundamentally linked to that of the univocity of being? Because beings which are distinguished solely by the degree of their power are beings which realize a single univocal being, except for the difference in the degree of power or its withdrawal. So between a table, a little boy, a little girl, a locomotive, a cow, a god, the difference is solely one of degree of power in the realization of one and the same being. It’s a strange way of thinking, since once again it consists in saying to us: the forms, the functions, the species and the genera are secondary. Beings are defined by degrees of power and there you are. Insofar as they are defined by degrees of power, each being realizes one and the same being, the same being as the other beings since being is said in one and the same sense, except for the difference in degree of power. At this level, there are no longer any categories, no longer any forms, no longer any species.\n\nIn a sense, it’s a thought so very far from the ordinary notions of species and genus that, once again, between two members of the same species there can be more differences, more differences in the degree of power than between two beings of different species. Between a racehorse and a draft horse, which belong to the same species, the difference can perhaps be thought as greater than the difference between a draft horse and an ox. Which comes down to saying that the draft horse and the ox are taken in the same assemblage [agencement] and that their degrees of power are closer to one another’s than is the draft horse’s degree of power to the racehorse’s.\n\nA further step can be taken, that is, that this thought of degrees of power is linked, no longer to a conception of genera and species, but to a conception of assemblages into which each being is capable of entering. We had begun with Spinoza for Spinoza is perhaps the only one to have worked from the point of view [sous les espèces] of reason, to have pursued a kind [espèce] of mad thought. There’s always in Lovecraft, the author of novels of terror and science fiction, there’s always reference to a mysterious book which falls from the hands of whomever touches it and this book is called the Necronomicon, the famous book of the mad Arab. And Spinoza’s Ethics is just that, the famous book of the mad Jew. The true name of the Ethics is the Necronomicon. I had begun by explicating the following: imagine how Spinoza saw things; when he directed his eyes toward things he saw neither forms nor organs, neither genera nor species. It’s easy to say, but less easy to live like that. It’s necessary to train oneself, although there are those who are gifted.\n\nI open a parenthesis: French philosophy…there are bits of nationality about which I understand nothing, but I note that the French are the sort who believe for example in the ego [moi]; it’s not by chance that their only philosopher said “cogito.” The subject, the ego; there are some strange people who say “the ego.” I don’t understand. I think of the differences of nationality because the English are the sort who have never understood what the Ego means. There was a famous colloquium to which all the sorts of so-called analytical philosophy, of current English logic, had come, and then there was Merleau-Ponty on the French side, and the others, the English, were there like they were at the zoo. It’s not that they were against him.\n\nBut it’s quite curious, if you take the great English philosophers—of course, they say “I,” but yet again it’s not this that’s the problem—for them it’s the most comical notion and they ask themselves from where can such a belief, that of the ego, come. A belief in the identity of the ego is a madman’s trick [truc de fous]. And they really think like that, they don’t sense “egos” in themselves. The English novelists are similar: their heroes are never presented as “egos.” Think of French novels, then it’s truly the opposite, one wallows in “egos,” everybody says “cogito” in the French novel.\n\nLet’s try to imagine how Spinoza saw things. He did not see genera, species, he did not see categories, so what did he see? He saw differences of degrees of power… I said broadly that to each thing will correspond a kind of degree of power and that, if need be, two things said to be of the same species might have degrees of power much more different that two things of different species. To make this more concrete we say that to each degree of power corresponds a certain power of being affected. Its power of being affected is what reveals the degree of power of a thing, of an animal, of [unclear word]. In other words, you will not be defined by your form, by your organs, by your organism, by your genus or by your species, tell me the affections of which you are capable and I’ll tell you who you are. Of what affects are you capable? It’s self-evident that between a draft horse and a racehorse the power of being affected is not the same, in a fundamental way; the proof is that if you put a racehorse into the assemblage of a draft horse, it’s quite likely that it will be worn out in three days.\n\nWe have this group of notions: being is said in one and the same sense of everything of which it’s said; hence beings are not distinguished by their form, their genus, their species, they’re distinguished by degrees of power. These degrees of power refer to powers of being affected, the affects being precisely the intensities of which a being is capable. Now it’s becoming more coherent. With the result that, I assume, when Spinoza directed his eyes toward whatever, he grasped powers of being affected. He grasped populations of intensities, he grasped capacities and perhaps he confused an ox and a draft horse, and on the other hand he did not confuse a racehorse and a draft horse. As we would say today, he makes these cuts [coupures] differently than the others. Then there’s no more than an effort to accomplish.\n\nIn any case, it’s not necessary to believe that power [pouvoir] means a possibility that might not be fulfilled. Power [puissance] and degrees of power, this is no longer the Aristotelian world which is a world of analogy, it’s not power which is distinguished from the act. The power of being affected, in any case, is or will be fulfilled, is fulfilled at each instant; it’s necessarily fulfilled, and why? It’s necessarily fulfilled at each instant by virtue of the variable assemblages into which it enters. That is, the affect is the manner in which a degree of power is necessarily actualized [effectué] as a function of the assemblages into which the individual or the thing enters.\n\nA power of being affected is always fulfilled; it can be fulfilled in different ways, everything depends on the assemblage. In what ways can it be fulfilled, since it’s fulfilled in any case? This is Spinoza’s last thought: he says broadly that it’s fulfilled in any case, but it can be fulfilled in two fashions. A degree of power is necessarily realized, or a power of being affected is necessarily fulfilled, that refers to these same two propositions, but very broadly speaking it can be fulfilled in two directions: either my power of being affected is fulfilled in such a way that my power of acting increases, or in such a way that my power of acting diminishes. Spinoza specifies: when my power of acting diminishes, this means, very broadly speaking, that my affects are sad; my power of being affected is completely fulfilled by sadness. For example “I’m guilty” or “I’m depressed” or “it’s not going well”; but “it’s not going well” completely fulfills my power of being affected.\n\nAnd why, when my affects are sad, is my power of acting diminished while my power of being affected is fulfilled? The way in which Spinoza views people is very, very beautiful. It’s even more beautiful when one sees the objections that people made to him, for example that imbecile [débile] Hegel. When Hegel says, against Spinoza, “ah that one never understood anything of the labor of the negative,” it’s perfect, the labor of the negative is a load of crap. It’s not that he doesn’t understand, he understands very well: the labor of the negative or the sad passions are those which fulfill my power of being affected in conditions such that my power of acting necessarily diminishes. When I’m sad, my power of acting diminishes.\n\nIt’s obvious, it sufficed to think it: when you’re affected with sad affects, there’s an object, something, an animal or a person which combines with you and that person or thing affects you with sadness. But in the case of the sad affect, the power of the other thing and your own would be subtracted since all your efforts at that moment would consist in struggling against this sadness and hence your power and the power of the thing which affects you would be subtracted. When, on the contrary, you are affected with joyful affects, the power of the thing which affects you with joyful affects and your own power are combined and added so that your power of acting, for that same power of being affected which is your own, is increased. Thus everything is crystal clear.\n\nThere you are, the linkage of notions: univocity of being, differences of degrees of power, powers of being affected each of which corresponds to a degree of power, power of acting which increases or diminishes depending on whether the affects which fulfill your power of being affected are by nature sad or joyful.\n\nA student : Are the degrees of power degrees of the same power?\n\nDeleuze: Obviously. Power is being, therefore there’s only one single power and the differences of power are intensive differences.\n\nThe student: Isn’t this in fact a model of causality? Several years ago we had interpreted causality in Spinoza in terms of structural causality. For my part, I think that one could interpret Spinoza’s thought in terms of energetic causality. Effectively this would be a substance defined as potential energy, and I would take this potential energy as an operational concept, a concept rigorously equivalent to the Nietzschean concept of the will to power.\n\nDeleuze: Okay. This seems dangerous to me because we’re just barely getting out of the abstract, and you’re putting us back into it. It’s not simply a question of a peculiar vision of the world; it’s again eminently a question of politics. Spinoza’s basic idea is very simple, it’s that there are two plagues of the human genus, and it’s in this that Spinoza is Nietzschean and Nietzsche is Spinozist. He says that there are two scourges: hatred and remorse. Nietzsche will say that there are two scourges: man as malady, ressentiment and bad conscience. Ressentiment and bad conscience are literally what Spinoza called hatred and remorse.\n\nHere one could find a kind of psychiatric tableau of the affections of hatred and the affections of remorse. But what interests him in this way of seeing all that — this is not a psychiatry — what interests him is obviously politics. Spinoza asks himself: what are those things called powers-that-be [pouvoirs]? He posed the question of power in a ridiculous enough way: power [pouvoir] is opposed to power of action [puissance]; power of action [puissance] is concerns us personally, concerns each one of us, concerns animals, concerns things. But power [pouvoir] is something else. He asks how it functions: people take power over others. What does it mean to have power over someone? Having power over someone is being in a position to affect her or him in such and such a way. The powers-that-be are fundamentally institutions built to affect you with sadness, they work like that and can only work like that. Things like hope, reward and security are put on the side of sad affects.\n\nA student: Desire also.\n\nDeleuze: No, how awful, what are you saying? Don’t listen to him. — The powers-that-be only keep hold on us by affecting us, which is to say by fulfilling our power of being affected with sad affects, and undoubtedly thousands of ways of doing this exist. And what Spinoza had in view is the power of the State and the power of the Church. He thinks that the power of the State and the power of the Church are fundamentally powers which take hold of their subjects by affecting them with sad affects, which is to say that power depresses them. This is the fundamental operation of power; affecting us with sadness, which obviously implies a whole play of compensations, “if you were wise, you would have had a reward,” it’s for that reason that Spinoza puts the taste for medals on the side of the sad affects, rewards are like a kind of compensation for a fundamental sadness of being.\n\nPower [pouvoir] and power of action [puissance] are opposed since power [pouvoir] is an institution which functions essentially by affecting us with sad affects, which is to say by diminishing our power of acting. It needs to diminish our power of action precisely in order to exercise its own power over us. On the contrary, the powers [puissances] of liberation are, or will be, those which affect us with joyful affects. If you’re sad you are oppressed, depressed… you’ve been had. How do they live, the sad and depressed? They live under the form of contagion, they won’t let you go. A depressed person is an explosive force, you grasp that. It’s tragic, it’s tragedy itself. Nietzsche developed this quite simple idea even further: the man of ressentiment is venomous; his idea is to render you ashamed of the least happiness. Spinoza won’t even say that social institutions furnish us with models. He will say that they fulfill us with affections. A social institution is a machine of affects; it fulfills your power of being affected. This is not ideological.\n\nHe’s really very, very clever, and truly in the Nietzschean sense of “why I am so clever,” he takes terms which are current in his epoch, most notably the Cartesian vocabulary, and turns it against Descartes.\n\nA student: [Inaudible comment]\n\nDeleuze: The whole discourse of representation is structured by analogical principles and thus Spinoza’s whole operation consists in making, in imposing a kind of assemblage of affects which implies likewise a critique of representation.\n\nThe Ethics is a book which proceeds via a quite malicious system; this system consists in producing texts, and then notes and notes to notes, and then notes to notes of notes. It’s obviously in the notes to notes that an enormous thing will be let loose. Spinoza himself found a far more formidable thing, and doubtless the geometrical method was necessary for that. His book has the appearance of being completely continuous, but in fact when one looks at it, one sees that there are propositions—like geometrical propositions—there are demonstrations, and then there are corollaries and then there are these strange things he calls scholia.\n\nAt first glance, it all follows. If you look closely, you’ll notice that in fact it’s not so tightly knit, that is to say the proposition-demonstration-corollary system is an autonomous system, that is the demonstrations always refer to other demonstrations or to other corollaries. And then the system of scholia is another system which coexists with the first and the scholia refer to one another. Thus there are two Ethics in one: an Ethics which functions in the mode of continuity and a secret Ethics which functions in the mode of discontinuity, and which is constituted by the scholia. If need be, there are forty pages without scholia and two scholia which refer to one another across these forty pages, and it’s in the scholia that he gives an aggressive version of what he says geometrically in the other system; so much so that, literally, the Ethics is simultaneously written twice: a violent and affective version and a rational and geometrical version.\n\nIt’s in the scholia that he says what an ethics is, to make an ethics is to make a theory and a practice of powers of being affected, and an ethics is opposed to a satirics [satirique]. What he calls a satirics is tremendous enough: it’s everything that takes pleasure one way or another in sad affects, everything which is depreciating and depressing. That’s the satirics. It’s obvious that all of morality goes under the name of satirics. What exactly does powers-that-be mean? And in what ways do the powers-that-be take hold in order to depress, to affect people with sad affects? … [End of the text]\n\n"

Purdue University Research Repository. doi:10.4231/XJ8P-FP63\n\n\n\n\nGilles Deleuze\n\nOn The Anti-Œdipe III, 1973-1974\n\n3rd Session, January 21, 1974 [Part 1]\n\nTranscription: WebDeleuze; modified transcription, Charles J. Stivale\n\nTranslation: Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni\n\nI would like us to be able to organize our paths of research here in line with the point we have reached. It seems to me that, given what we saw last time, we have three main directions.\n\nThe first direction is relative to what we saw last time: we had looked at a matter that we could call the plane of composition. This plane of composition was something we sometimes referred to as the plane of consistency, perhaps to place it more in relation with the operation of desire. Thanks to Spinoza, whose thinking was necessary in this regard, we were able to find a kind of compositional plane, a plane of consistency, which was defined by the unity of its materials, or in a certain way – which amounts to the same thing – by the position of univocity. This is a kind of thought that does not pass by way of forms, nor through organs or organisms, a kind of informal thought.\n\nAnd to say that the plane of consistency is defined by a unity of materials also refers us to a system of variables, and these variables consisted – once we had established that they were the same materials in all assemblages – the variables consisted in the positions and the connections. It was the variation of positions and connections of the materials that constituted the so-called machinic assemblages, machinic assemblages whose common point was that they all realized the plane of consistency according to this or that degree of power.\n\nSo we have a first very marked link between the plane of composition or consistency and the machinic assemblages which realized this plane in various ways, according to the position and the connections of the materials in each assemblage. And finally, according to each assemblage, circulations and transformations of affects were produced, a machinic assemblage being like a place of passage, a place of transformation of intensive affects, and these intensive affects corresponded to the degrees of power of each machinic assemblage.\n\nThis opens up a research path that will allow us to pose the question of the relation between intensities, intensive affects and forms. What is the relation between intensive quantities and forms, specific forms, categorical forms and generic forms, and so on? How is an intensive thought which does not pass by way of these forms possible? The whole of Scholasticism is traversed by a problem which is of vital importance to it, since it lies at the crossroads of physics and theology. This is the problem they were very conscious of during the whole of the Middle Ages, that of the relation between intensities and forms. In medieval philosophical terms, this problem was known as the latitude and remission of forms. The question is to know if a form is in itself susceptible to intensive variations, that is to say if it enjoys a dimension of latitude. The latitude of forms consisted in the possible variations of a form in terms of its intensities. For example, can one be more or less reasonable? Here, we can see how it will be up to us to transform this old problem, and at least we can situate it as an old classical problem: man being defined for example as a reasonable animal, a reasonable animal as a form composed both of a generic determination: animal, and of a specific difference: reasonable.\n\nTo be more or less reasonable. What can it mean when a form is susceptible to a certain latitude? If one can be more or less reasonable, is it that, at a push, there will be a degree zero of being reasonable which will certainly not be the same thing as the way in which an animal is not reasonable. How could they pose this problem of the relationship between intensities and forms? And once again, this runs through all the physics of the Middle Ages, all these attempts to make a science of intensive quantities. We had a kind of mixture that we must take in a very muddled way and that revolved around a kind of thought of degrees of power, of the assemblages into which these degrees of power entered, of a critique of forms, and of the effort…  of Spinoza’s own effort to think degrees of power independently of forms, functions, species and kinds. All this constitutes a curious philosophy that revolved around  thinking immanence or the univocity of being. It all turns around a kind of theory of the machinic assemblages that one tries to pursue.\n\nWhen we are told about a latitude of forms, before we have even seen what was meant by latitude in the Middle Ages, either we can say… I believe that in the Middle Ages, there were two main positions. There is the position which tells us, among other things, that a form itself can only be perfect, this is all that it has, therefore the notion of reasonable, for example, cannot be considered in terms of more or less. The plus or minus of the intensity, the latitude, that is, the thresholds between which the play of form takes place cannot come from the form itself. It can only come from the subject in which this form is realized or to which this form lays claim. Latitude is not a property of the form itself; it is a property of the subject that receives it. But there are others who would say that it is the form itself that is susceptible, under certain conditions, to a certain latitude, that is to say, that it plays between certain thresholds. What the two positions at least have in common is a certain subordination of the intensive latitude to the form.\n\nIn terms of the business of the egg, we had a very different position. There, it is the forms themselves that are as if subordinated to the intensive variations that determine them. In the question of the egg, the egg is considered as an intensive medium, and it is the thresholds of intensities which determine this or that form. It is as if the subordination between forms and intensities had been reversed. This is very important for us because, after all, it is by no means given that the egg is our past; this is a very dangerous conception, to consider that the egg is our past, since it naturally leads us on the path of regression. Is it not possible, not only from the point of view of embryology, but also from the point of view of the most lived experience, to conceive of the egg as being strictly always contemporary with ourselves, that is to say, that each of us carries our own egg with them, and what we call someone’s egg is his or her milieu of experimentation? So the egg is no longer in any way a refuge in the mode of a return to the mother, but is, if you like, the strictly contemporary placenta of ourselves. It is, finally, the milieu of strict contemporaneity. The egg is not at all the form in which I descend from a mother and incidentally from a father. The egg is like the contemporary plasma in relation to which father or mother and child are strictly contemporaneous with each other. The egg, strictly speaking, is the contemporary milieu where one cannot establish succession and in relation to which one cannot establish succession. From this point of view, the egg is really the contemporary intensive matter of any experimentation as such. It is always in the egg that one experiments. This is obviously a conception that always makes the egg our own past.[1]\n\nA student: [Inaudible remarks].\n\nDeleuze: Here is a text by a contemporary embryologist, who says that “Forms are contingent upon a kinematic dynamism” – it is about the development of the egg – “It is secondary whether or not an orifice forms in the germ. All that counts is the process of immigration itself; what yields an orifice fissure or primitive line is not invagination, but pure chronological and quantitative variations”[2] – that is, whether an energetic flow reaches a certain threshold or not. There, forms, including organic forms, are really secondary to thresholds of intensities.\n\nKyril Ryjik: When was this text written?\n\nDeleuze: About 1930.\n\nRyjik: That’s as far from us as…\n\nDeleuze: Why do you say that?\n\nRyjik: You’re talking in terms of intensities, whereas he’s talking as a phenomenologist, an observer. Biochemistry wouldn’t work, and where you would have to go back to intensities is in quantum biochemistry, for example, at the level of electronics. It is the structure of proteins that determines the forms.\n\n[WebDeleuze note: A long polemic ensued]\n\nDeleuze: I have the impression that this is not at all the same problem. Embryology deals with the way in which the egg develops and differentiates. When the embryologist claims around 1925-1930 that the determination of forms in relation to the development of the egg appeals to distributions of intensities, that is one thing; it does not claim to be molecular biology. To say that molecular biology goes beyond or is called to go beyond this point of view, seems to me to be without foundation. I am not saying that we should be satisfied with the egg as the ultimate unit. I am saying that whatever the state of physics or whatever the state of biology, there is indeed a problem which is the development of the egg as a – let’s use any word – a giant molecule, or molar unit. When someone is interested in the development of the egg and in the organization of intensities, to say to him: tell us about quantum physics, that is to say, about the molecular elements which are, if necessary, mixed with this, takes on a whole other dimension.\n\nRyjik: It’s not “if necessary”; you’re talking like a finalist. You’re looking at the egg as if it were the pole that attracts the intensities.\n\n[WebDeleuze note: The discussion continues for some time.]\n\nDeleuze: That was the first direction for me. Second direction…\n\nGeorges Comtesse: In your view, is it the conflicting difference between the forces of attraction and repulsion that determines the production of intensities on the egg?\n\nDeleuze: No. Regarding that, I would say that the distributions of intensities on the egg are much more linked to molecular machinic assemblages.\n\nThe second direction, one that we have addressed on all the previous occasions, is that machinic assemblages have nothing to do with forms, with separable forms, specific forms or generic forms. Machinic assemblages always problematize units of levels and contents that are completely different. Insofar as machinic assemblages are not representations of something, but transformations of affects, they put into play all kinds of becomings, and for a simple reason: it is that affect itself is a becoming, it is an intensive passage. Among the becomings put into play in machinic assemblages, are a becoming-animal and a becoming-molecular. But it is these affects that fill a capacity of being affected, or that circulate within a machinic assemblage, that mark the notion of the becoming-animal. For example, the becoming-horse of little Hans, the notion of becoming-molecular, and all these various becomings occur either in relation to machinic assemblages or involve real movements of deterritorialization and reterritorialization.\n\nIt is this whole becoming-animal, becoming-molecular, and the movements of deterritorialization that must be analyzed in terms of a machinic assemblage. And in this respect, we had sketched out a kind of possible program for the becomings-animal. Once again, we had had the presentiment that becomings-animal were not sufficient, that they were perhaps compromises, compromises between forms and intensities, and that beyond becomings-animal, there were still becomings-molecular.  We had seen the famous becomings-animal that occurred in Africa. Are there not very profound historical links between certain war customs and becomings-animal, where you have this whole notion of wild-man warriors. Would there also be a relationship between becomings-animal and certain secret societies, for example, secret societies in Africa?\n\nAnd finally, the third direction. This was that in these machinic assemblages, there always intervened – precisely because any arrangement put in relation units… [Text interrupted]\n\n[WebDeleuze note: A discussion of the notion of program follows]\n\n… The psychoanalytic operation is an operation of exchange that consists in saying: I will replace your affects with fantasies. When we talk about the psychoanalytic contract, we have to see that, by nature, it is double: there is an external contract which is the visible contract: you give me money and I listen to you; and the invisible contract: you give me your affects for the benefit of a scene of fantasy representation.\n\nRichard Pinhas: There’s no real secret about it, since Freud devoted an entire text to explaining that he was exchanging people’s lived configurations, emotions and affects for discourse and representative configurations.\n\nDeleuze: Yes, but that doesn’t prevent it from arriving at a new stage with Melanie Klein. There, the object of the exchange passes through the fantasy, whereas with Freud, it was not posed like that at all.\n\nA student: I don’t really see the distinction between fantasy and representation as long as we consider that the social machine consists in inscribing affects in a generic conceptual language.\n\nDeleuze: We all agree that there is no difference; fantasy is a kind of matrix of representation. [Text interrupted]\n\n… The first thing I see is that there is always something left to cover, namely the genesis of affects. This is the way in which the molecular elements affect each other according to the positions and the variable connections that will generate the affects that run through the machinic assemblage. It is even in this way that we will be able to justify the formula: only machines are affective, it is the machines that are affective. They are not representations of something, they are affective and they are programs of affects.\n\nThe second thing is that the signs of affect are indeed like indices of representation from which one induces [indistinct words]. Here, I am less sure of what I’m saying because if we take up again [indistinct words], once again, if we take up the way little Hans defines the horse, what is important for us is not the horse in general, it is the ONE horse that he programmed as part of his machinic assemblage. When he says that he has blinkers, black around his mouth, and what have you, if you separate each thing – because it is still representation, the representation of a street scene, the horse that little Hans saw dragging…  but in another way and along another line which would be the affective program of little Hans, it is already something other than a representation, namely circulations of affects. Little Hans won’t see a horse wearing blinkers, he will instead be affected by what he experiences as the blindness of the horse, the active blindness of the horse as it is caused by man. And here, we are no longer in the domain of representation. If you separate the elements, you will say that each one refers to a representation. But if you establish the circulation in terms of this mystery, you will ask how little Hans makes an affect circulate, how he passes from one affect to another. For example, an essential problem, it seems to me, in little Hans’s assemblage is: does the horse bite because it has fallen or for some other reason? What is the affect that is transformed into biting?\n\nIf we transform this in terms of fantasies, you see that the answer is the psychoanalytic answer, namely that “making noise with his feet” refers to the primal scene, to the fantasy representation of the primal scene. Previously we said that as far as we were concerned, we didn’t give a damn about all that, that the machinic assemblage was completely sexual in itself and had nothing to do with a fantasy. At that point, it is enough to reintroduce the movement of affects in the machinic assemblage so that it becomes the programming of this assemblage where nothing is exactly a representative index anymore, although, at each moment, if you make a cut, at such and such a moment, you reduce things to signs of representation.\n\nSo, I believe that it would be necessary to introduce a double point of view because it is true that it is, in the last instance, molecular relations that account for the distribution of affects in a machinic assemblage, while, at another level, it is the machinic assemblage that causes molecular lines, becomings-molecular or at least becomings-animal to take flight. It is in this sense that I ask the question: wouldn’t the becoming-animal still be a compromise?\n\nThe becoming-animal, however fascinating it may be and whatever it is used for… here I  again take up the example of the war machine: in the war machine in general, there is indeed a notion of becoming-animal. I take again the example of the wild-man warrior. And then there is something else, in the war machine there is not only the notion of becoming-animal, there is also a kind of becoming-molecular, like a kind of molecular line. This is at the level of a consistent machine: the war machine. But at the level of the scientific machine and its possible unities with the war machine, the becomings-molecular will perhaps represent a kind of becoming that, in terms of intensities or in terms of deterritorialization, goes much further than the becoming-animal.\n\nWe can present things in two ways: either we can say that finally, what happens at the level of machinic assemblages is a kind of intensive continuum. There is an intensive continuum or, instead of there being forms separated from one another, there is a transformation, a passage from one form to another through intensive continuity, which does not prevent us from marking the thresholds of this continuity. For example, I can very well present the relation of becoming-animal and the relation of becoming-molecular in the form of an intensive continuum. Here I take a classic example: the double aspect in science fiction where we have a certain notion of becoming-animal, and the way in which the becoming-animal is relayed by something that goes even further, namely a becoming-molecular. We can say that there is a kind of intensive continuum on which we can stagger the becoming-animal and the becoming-molecular, and there is a passage, a kind of threshold, the crossing of a gradient. If we reintroduce in one way or another the notion of form, however, we will find ourselves back in this business of analogies, homologies and structures.\n\nOn the other hand, as long as you stick to the notion of a program, it doesn’t bother me. There is an intensive continuum of substance where a threshold is crossed. For example, here I come back to my example: in terms of the question of transplants or eggs, it is quite simple: something that was destined to become the caudal appendage of the newt, for example, is displaced. What does it mean to “shift on an egg”? It means: to graft upon a region of a different intensity. Instead of becoming a caudal appendage, it produces something else; precisely, a threshold has been crossed through migration. Through migration, which is to say that, in the very egg itself, a process of deterritorialization is inscribed, since a part that was normally destined to become such a thing at such a threshold of intensity, will, by means of migration, now produce something else; there is a crossing of a threshold. Here, I can say that the forms are not important, that what determines these forms as a secondary product from the point of view of representation, are purely the migrations. And by migrations I do not at all mean migrations in terms of spatial extension, I mean in terms of changes in intensity.\n\nI would say, on the other hand, that this intensive continuum can be expressed in another way. There are even three ways of expressing it, and these three ways are like three coordinates of a machinic assemblage. We can say that there are no more forms, that instead there is an intensive continuum of substances… [End of first part; second part missing]\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Let us note that this sentence seems to contradict the previous statements. Without any recordings, we are unable to verify Deleuze’s statement.\n\n[2] The source of this quotation is Albert Dalcq, L’œuf et son dynamisme organisateur (Paris: Albin Michel, 1941), p. 95, quoted in A Thousand Plateaus, p. 532, note 7. See also A Thousand Plateaus, p. 164, “The egg is the milieu of pureintensity, spatium not extension, Zero intensity as principle of production.There is a fundamental convergence between science and myth, embryology and mythology, the biological egg and the psychic or cosmic egg: the egg always designates this intensive reality, which is not undifferentiated, but is where things and organs are distinguished solely by gradients, migrations, zones of proximity. The egg is the BwO”.\n\n"

Moreover, Part I begins with Deleuze’s review of specific points covered in several preceding sessions for which we have no recordings, followed by shorter, successive segments. Hence, we situate the approximate session dates as I, starting on November 18, 1975, II continuing on November 25, and ending with a brief segment III, on December 2.]\n\n[Deleuze, with Guattari in attendance, reviews the concepts of molar and molecular aggregates and multiplicities, thereby developing their ongoing collaboration which will result, in 1980, in A Thousand Plateaus.]\n\n[Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions]\n\n[Part I, 0:00, to 1:14:59; Part II, 1:15:00, to 1:31:09; Part III, 1:31:10, to 1:40:51, of YouTube recording, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM2IAFRhe54&t=24s\n\n[Deleuze entering the room very slowly, due crowd blocking his path]\n\nDeleuze: How are we going to manage?\n\nA woman student: We can just stay here like this.\n\nAnother woman student: It’s not complicated… you just have to lift your leg…\n\nDeleuze: I can’t. It’s stuck… [Pause] It’s not just to be able to move, it’s so we can breathe… [Pause] It’s a life question! [Pause]\n\nA woman student: Can you put out that cigarette?\n\nDeleuze: Aaaah! [He lifts his legs and continues trying to enter] [Pause] Hello, Félix. [Pause; Deleuze observes the crowd, looks at the blackboard for chalk, slowly takes off his coat, then places his books on the table] I’d like to raise a problem, an interesting one. Over there, [He points to the left, his right] there’s glass fiber there. Imagine if a fire broke out. [Pause] You see the door? [He points over to his far left] We would all die. All of us. [Nervous laughter]\n\nA woman student: Unless we jump from the window. [Pause]\n\nDeleuze: Except me, perhaps… [Laughter] But all of you will perish. Which is to say you shouldn’t come to class; I have to be quite honest! The working conditions here don’t conform to safety norms. So when the fire starts, don’t panic. We don’t move, we don’t worry…\n\nGuattari: Have you seen Narboni who was waiting for you…\n\nDeleuze: Sorry?\n\nGuattari: Tu as vu Narboni ?\n\nDeleuze: Yes, I’ve seen Narboni. [Pause; Deleuze speaks to students behind him quite softly perhaps to ask that they not smoke] … That will make me choke. [Pause] That’s better. [Pause] Does anyone have a piece of chalk? [Pause] Some chalk? [Pause] Some chalk? [Pause] Thank you… Ok, so, as usual I will summarize the topics we have already covered because… what is it?\n\nA student: I can’t hear very well.\n\nDeleuze: It will come. My voice is always a bit low to begin with. It will come. So, the topics… I think we began with… I’ll always recapitulate like this, so that when we go back to a given topic, those who were present…\n\nA woman student: Louder!\n\nDeleuze: Oh no, shit, really? — … those who were present will be able to recall it. So, there’s a first topic that we will put aside for the moment, concerning a certain number of figures of segmentarity. And then there’s a second topic, which concerns at the same time molar aggregates and molecular lines. And, of course, these molar aggregates and molecular lines become mixed. We also briefly mentioned two complementarities, two relations of complementarity between the molar aggregates and the molecular lines that mix with them.\n\nFirst of all, there is a direct complementarity: the bigger the molar aggregates become, the more the molecular lines become enmeshed with them, trace movements of flight etc. And there is also a second complementarity that is… Did I start with the direct one? I don’t remember…\n\n \n\nA student: Yes.\n\nDeleuze: There is an inverse complementarity. Last time, we also sketched out a third topic which was a rapid analysis, or rather a rapid effect of the analysis, of the verb “to be” as a principle of the molar aggregates and their elements. And, on the other hand, we made an analysis of the conjunction “and” as a broken-line type of movement, a movement of the molecular line. And we imagined a kind of… tension – which is not contradiction – but a kind of tension between the “est” (is) of the verb “to be” and the “et” (and) of the conjunction, and we said that this tension would, for different reasons, traverse language as a whole, or at least certain languages.\n\nAnd some of you raised the objection that apparently, in some languages this tension between “est” and “et” doesn’t exist. Not only does it not exist but also the very structure of these languages denies it. This really unsettled us and yet, at the same time, we noted that a certain play of the conjunction “and” defines minor languages, or the minor use of certain languages, in opposition to the imperialism and hegemony of the verb “to be” in so-called major languages. And we also realized that we would have to return to this objection for the themes for which we had no answer at the time, thinking we would devote a lesson to it, and those who had made objections, namely that this wouldn’t work, at least in the cases of Arabic or Chinese.\n\nBut we were reassured by the fact that it did work for languages I proposed to call neither minor nor major – languages eroded from within by strong minorities, such as British and American English. British and American English as a whole are traversed by a very peculiar use of the conjunction “and”. There we are. You may have found all this a bit dispersive, but I think you’ve understood that… [Deleuze does not complete the sentence]\n\nToday, I’d like to start on a fourth topic and this fourth topic would consist more or less in saying that we will try to establish a certain status typical of what we could call “molecular multiplicities”. You see, this could be considered a different topic but at the same time it’s the same as the previous ones because it implies a certain rapport between multiplicities that we call “molar” and multiplicities that we call “molecular”. And, together with Guattari, I have sought… I don’t want to go back to things we’ve already covered but I would like to tell you how we have managed to advance on this somewhat. We looked for a certain number of variables that could be considered variables of a particular type of multiplicity, which we will call “molecular”. I pronounce these first of all for the pleasure the words give me, but also so that all of you can bear them in mind and to situate them in aggregates, in masses, in multiplicities.\n\nThe variables we wish to propose today are those that correspond to the category of bridges. A bridge. A bridge might not seem very molecular but it doesn’t matter. A bridge… Second variable: ring, or network. Third variable: borderline. Fourth variable: threshold and door. Fifth variable: fiber. Sixth variable, which is obviously the most beautiful: rhizosphere, or plane of consistency. Good. I’ll say that for the moment I would roughly like to place them, while avoiding anything to do with axioms or structures. I want to place these variables within a certain type of multiplicity.\n\nObviously…  obviously these multiplicities or these masses don’t exist on their own. I think again of the objection we began with yesterday, that all this is anyhow a form of dualism. Molecular multiplicities, when they are present, spread or stretch out, they spread together with multiplicities of large aggregates, multiplicities we shall call “molar”. They are inside, they slip underneath, spread out on the surface, they always exist one within the other, according to what we previously defined as a double complementarity.\n\nSo, we have to begin again from the schema we proposed at a certain point that concerned – and here I’ll be brief – multiplicities of a primarily molar nature. How do we recognize a molar multiplicity? Molar multiplicities include both aggregates – large aggregates – and the elements of these large aggregates. You remember how we were convinced that the distinction molar/molecular doesn’t correspond to that between aggregate and element? So, molar multiplicities are a certain type of aggregate comprised of certain elements.\n\nHow do we define them? We proposed to define them through the schema of arborescence. Each time you have an arborescent schema you have the formal pattern of a multiplicity that we can call a molar multiplicity. The simplest arborescent schema – because arborescent schemas are extremely complicated – the simplest arborescent schema is that which proceeds — I’m not brave enough to go to the blackboard, so please follow my finger — is that which proceeds by a succession of dichotomies. But there are others that are more complicated. If I try to express the arborescent schema in its most general form… — perfect, perfect [Deleuze reacts to someone on his right who has brought in a tree branch, soon to be visible on camera; Deleuze stands and goes to the board] But the one you’ve got is simple — [Pause] More or less it, would be this. [Pause] I can’t continue because… well, we don’t need this. [Pause] So, there we have an arborescent schema in its most general form.\n\nIf I try now quickly to list its characteristics, even if this means connecting them with things we looked at last year, I would say that in this aggregate, in this type of multiplicity – the molar multiplicity – their first characteristic is that binary machines exist in their own right. Every time, you have a dichotomizing operation that exists in its own right. Once again, either you’re a man or a woman, a bourgeois or a proletarian and so on. It’s all a play of binary machines that exist in their own right.\n\nSecond characteristic: there is… these multiplicities that we call molar are centered multiplicities. Here, the center is shown by the small circle. In other words, if I try to connect it to the things that we looked at last year, there is a central black hole. And this central black hole is not the only one. On the contrary… All the other black holes spread around the multiplicity, resonate together with the central black hole, which in this way is able to move in all directions. Last year, we would have said: All the eyes resonate in a kind of central computer-eye, a single eye, a third eye, which organizes the multiplicity as a whole.\n\nThird characteristic: I will say that these multiplicities are evolutive multiplicities, even if they don’t actually evolve. But if they don’t evolve, what happens to them? If they don’t evolve, they end up regressing. Yet both regression and progression are characteristics – directions – of evolution itself. By evolutive multiplicities I mean that they undergo a progression or a regression. In other words, what determines these multiplicities are lines of filiation or lines of lineage.\n\nIt’s not by chance that the doctrine that was called Evolutionism began – and I stress that this was just a beginning because it wasn’t limited to this – it began by posing questions in terms of filiation and lineage. In this regard, Darwin’s key text speaks of how the novelty of Evolutionism consists in raising the questions of filiation and lineage that had never been posed by previous natural historians. However, this doesn’t mean they ignored other phenomena. So what are these phenomena? We shall see, we shall see… These other phenomena, which we’ll look at later, are treated as categories that have to be subordinated to phenomena of filiation and lineage.\n\nOther characteristics, and now I’d like to read you a text. “In an arborescent system, only a single neighbor is admitted: the hierarchical superior.” [The text is by Pierre Rosenstiehl and Jean Petitot, “Automate asocial et systèmes acentrés”, Communications 22 (1974); see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 16-17] It’s all in the schema. You start from a branch, this point that I call “small a” admits only one neighbor, the one from which it receives information, and which in the arborescent series of ramifications is its hierarchical superior. Or, if you prefer, from the perspective of filiation, its ancestor. The genetic ancestor, for example.\n\nThe text goes on: “In an arborescent system, the channels of transmission are pre-established. Arborescence pre-exists the individual, who is integrated into it at a precise point.” In computer science, this is called “a regime of centered automata”. It goes without saying that if I try – from the point of view of evolutive multiplicities – to define what progression is in opposition to regression, I would say that progression is the passage from the least differentiated (like you have there for example) to the most differentiated. In fact, when biologists of Darwin’s epoch were asked what was the single criterion for organic progression, they would say it’s an organism that becomes increasingly differentiated.\n\nThe last feature I wish to insist upon is that in these molar multiplicities… — I’m not fully committed here; we could really… these are questions that I’d like almost immediately to pose to you; we could trace a genesis, a passage from one characteristic to the other; it would be easy to consider how they end up, but it’s not worth it; let’s just consider them as characteristics — So the last characteristic I will consider for the moment is that, in this type of multiplicity, there must be a principle of what we will call organization or structuration, which conducts the increasingly advanced game of differentiation or which distributes the binarities, the dichotomies, or which makes the black holes circulate throughout the entire system. But what is interesting is that this organizing or structuring principle is always hidden. It lets us see but is itself unseen.\n\nSo, for molar multiplicities what is invoked is an intelligibility that is deeper than sensibility. Or we have an interior – for example an interior of life – deeper than the manifestations of life. For example, as far as we know… I would almost say that if we can recognize in a multiplicity one of the aforementioned characteristics… I hope that in today’s seminar it will all become clearer and more concrete. But if we found one of the aforementioned features at a concrete level in a multiplicity, I think we could say: however small it may be, however minuscule the elements at play, what we have is a molar multiplicity.\n\nI’ll give you an example: so-called Western music, and by this I’m not referring just to contemporary music but to classical music. In a way, we’ve always been told that there was a principle that we can also call… that for a musical work considered as a sonic multiplicity, there was a principle that could be called, no matter, a structuring principle or an organizational principle, and it was this principle that gave us to hear or listen. It was this principle that let us hear what we heard. But in and for itself, it went unheard. And if we consider what certain composers – even contemporary composers like Stockhausen or Boulez – refer to today as structure, it’s clear that a musical structure makes us hear. But the structure itself goes unheard. And perhaps, if we take this term in a wider sense, it can be understood only through what it lets us hear.\n\nNow, here’s the question I wanted to ask without any need of an immediate answer: I wonder if, for example, what we could broadly call the Western conception of the unconscious doesn’t depend precisely on this type of molar multiplicity. We shall see… For the moment, all this is still quite abstract, but I would like to speak about things of a more concrete nature. We don’t even need to mention now that there exist multiplicities of another type — molecular multiplicities — but let’s just say that in this schema of molar multiplicities you have all kinds of other phenomena slipping in, making irruptions, mixing with, penetrating molar multiplicities and constituting within them – in a completely immanent manner – another type of multiplicity that will perturb them from within. This is an important thing to bear in mind for the future because, if there are such workings from within, if molar multiplicities are affected by multiplicities of a different nature, you’ll see that we will be able to find a better order for the topics we covered in the last few lessons.\n\nI would like to demonstrate this by mixing almost everything together, which is to say by invoking a little bit of science and a bit of… not exactly dream, but I don’t know, let’s say literature. But I won’t mix them, because otherwise none of you will give it credence. I would like to identify some poles – a certain number of poles – pertaining to what certain experts are researching. And this is important for us because in every field today… Guattari and I, when we find a specific example that we can’t fully understand, because the scholars can be extremely difficult… the only thing we immediately understand is that each time they say: “What we apply are above all arborescent schema”, which incidentally are much more elaborate than my little schema. You would need specialized mathematicians to make sense of them. But for example, in mathematical statistics – which is an extremely difficult, highly complex field – they have a method called (and it’s not by chance they’ve given it this name, since scholars don’t use metaphors) counting trees. Today mathematical statistics uses it all the time, but counting-trees methods don’t account for the kind of phenomena I’m interested in.\n\nWe have to find a completely different model – I don’t care what term we use – a completely different model or schema or type. And everywhere you look — in biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, linguistics, everywhere — in every field, arborescent schema that for a long time have been dominant, and which according to me are still completely tied to the axiomatic period of science, are in the process of being overturned. Because science has ceased to be, or has ceased to take up, any kind of axiomatic or structural ideal.\n\nBut let’s try to be more concrete. First of all, we have to confront the existence of what we can only call bridges. Bridges… and so what would a bridge be? Actually, we don’t really need to depart from my schema on the blackboard. It’s enough to simply add it in. And the question I want to pose now is: will this schema be able to answer or account for what I wish to add here? And what I wish to add is… this and this. Twice. Two bridges.\n\nSo how should we define these bridges? As whatever connection between two heterogeneous lines or lineages. These are things that all of us know, and that we’ve already looked at, so I’m going to speed things up a bit. Let’s go back to some examples that Guattari and I have already developed at length. There’s an odd story we keep going back to, which is quite fascinating: wasp-orchid. [See A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 10-13, 293-294] In simple terms, the orchid reproduces a sort of image of the wasp in such a way that it can wed itself to the wasp’s image. A kind of transversal bond is created between two realms, between an element of the vegetable kingdom and one of the animal kingdom. This is what I would call a bridge.\n\nYou see what we’re attempting to derive. You can never derive a bridge from a filiation. If I was to seek a common filiation, my whole schema would collapse because I placed the bridge between two series, two differentiated lines. But here at the top of the board we have a common filiation, and the bridge makes it collapse. We would have to find a common filiation, a common ancestor of the wasp and the orchid. We can actually go as far as saying that a bridge is always between realms [inter-règne].\n\nSo already here, we have no choice if we accept all this, that there are bridges. Bridges don’t only exist in biology. Physicists and chemists too speak of having to introduce bridges into piles. In current theories regarding polymers, for example, there is a need to introduce bridges – while classical schemes don’t acknowledge this.\n\nI would say that the bridge is always a term of alliance, an alliance between two realms, so the living world is no longer understood – I’m exaggerating – so the different parts of the living world are no longer understood in terms of filiations and lineages but of alliances, which suits us perfectly. Because if we try to define Neo-evolutionism, which is to say Post-Darwinian evolutionary theory, we would say that it’s a theory that has increasingly been forced to renounce the primacy, the hegemony of the theme of filiations.\n\nSo can we say there is a wasp-orchid alliance? We know there exist phenomena of vital alliances in the aggregates of so-called symbioses or parasitisms, but more generally in the domain of symbiosis. It would be interesting if evolution occurred through alliance rather than filiation, at which point perhaps it would no longer be evolution. So what would it be? Another kind of multiplicity: molecular multiplicities, micro-multiplicities.\n\nBridges define and bring into play a whole system of micro-multiplicities. But in what sense? For example, in contemporary genetic research we are told that beyond any filiation there may be communication between two lines, two completely independent series, through a virus. A virus that connects both to the genetic inheritance of a given species and to that of another species that has nothing in common with the first – so the virus functions as a bridge between two species with no common filiation and which have absolutely nothing to do with one another.\n\nViruses are interesting because they introduce us more closely to a molecular schema: alliances that go against nature… but, even if there are other types, aren’t all alliances interkingdom in nature, made between two realms? So that’s what we call a bridge, and that would be the first feature of this type of multiplicity: connections of whatever type between independent series or between lines irreducible to a filiation or a common lineage.\n\nA student: More slowly please!\n\nDeleuze: What?\n\nThe student: Not so fast…\n\nDeleuze: Am I going too fast for you? On the contrary, I’m going to go even faster! … [Tape interrupted] [37:43]\n\nThere… now my schema is perfect. Good. See? I’ve got bridges which are themselves connected to each other. Why is this interesting? Because… it’s not that interesting? Why is it interesting? Because it’s a state where there is a swarming of black holes, a multiplicity of black holes that doesn’t let itself… that doesn’t resonate within a central black hole. Why is this?\n\nWell, in contrast to a feature of molar multiplicities that we saw before, here each element – each black hole if you will — each element is at once emitter and receiver. In the theory of automata – and I insist on this point – everything that cannot be reduced to an arborescent schema implies that each element is both emitter and receiver. So that’s what our schema looks like, and it’s not reducible to an arborescent schema. You see? I have my network, my ring, and my connecting bridges, each time with a black hole that is both receiver and emitter of each element, of each black hole. As a result, you no longer have a hierarchical arborescent structure but a ring.\n\nNow I’m going to read something by a contemporary specialist who researches certain phenomena in physics. It’s a text that I’d like Guattari to comment on later, if he feels like it… [Pause] Page 906: “If we suppose that clusters have a simple ramified structure like a family tree, we omit the possibility of cyclization”. You see… the phenomenon of cyclization that unites all the elements in a network, such that each is at once emitter and receiver.\n\nYou see that up until now — I wish I had spoken in more concrete terms; I started badly; I should have begun with some concrete examples but now it’s too late — Up until now — maybe I can get back on track — I’ve limited myself to a single multiplicity. But something is happening here. I’m trying to show how in any molar multiplicity something of another nature begins to insinuate itself. It’s still a molar multiplicity but something odd is slipping into it, laying down its bridges, connecting them in networks and rings. But what is this? Don’t be surprised if we have to turn to horror stories as much as to science in order to figure this out. In fact, with my first two notions of bridge and ring (or network), I’ve remained within the context of a given multiplicity, one that is single and determined, a particular multiplicity.\n\nHow do we define it? This is my third notion. How do we define a multiplicity? In the case of a molar multiplicity we define it through – as we saw – a structuring or organizing principle that isn’t given as such. Here, at least, the answer is simple. But in the case of these crafty multiplicities, these discreet multiplicities that insinuate themselves, that we are trying to catch as they insinuate themselves… I can’t say they have an organizing or structuring principle since that’s how I defined molar multiplicities. What defines this kind of multiplicities — and this too is something we covered last year so I’ll be brief — what defines these multiplicities is a certain number of dimensions that they have. These multiplicities are defined through their dimensions.\n\nBut how do you understand how many dimensions they have? Well, they have a maximal dimension. A maximal dimension, each of these multiplicities has a maximal dimension, and here’s where it gets interesting. It’s by determining the maximal dimension of a multiplicity that I am able to say how many dimensions it has. It will have as many dimensions as are contained by the maximal dimension.\n\nNow what is this maximal dimension? It’s what we can only call borderline and there it is, all at once we’re saved! The maximal dimension of a multiplicity is called borderline. It’s a strange thing, [Pause] it’s a strange thing, this notion of the borderline… as that which allows us to define a particular type of multiplicity, a molecular multiplicity, as opposed to the molar type, which is defined through a structuring organizing principle that remains secret, hidden.\n\nIt’s a bizarre thing… If we take say a “fly” multiplicity or a “fog” multiplicity, or a “mosquito” — finally we’re down to the concrete, while still remaining within science — what are these multiplicities?  A fly by itself means nothing. A single fly is a lost fly, that is to say, it’s not a fly. What means something is when we say “flies”.  Félix and I said that the same is true for other beasts, but it bears repeating. One wolf doesn’t mean anything. “Wolves” means something. Or, rather, “wolf” means a lone wolf but the loner, well, isn’t he the border of the wolf multiplicity? Very good.\n\nIf the loner were the border of the multiplicity constituted by the pack of wolves, then we wouldn’t have to think of him as we do normally: as an exceptional individual. But simply, as the borderline determining the maximal dimension of the multiplicity, we shall call the “wolf multiplicity”, which is different from other multiplicities. And what about Moby Dick? Moby Dick, the great white whale? What is he, if not the borderline of the school of whales? Perhaps it always takes a monster to make the borderline, and we have to ask ourselves why this is.\n\nYou may think I have totally abandoned science, but what I’m saying is completely scientific. It’s not surprising that neo-evolutionists think solely in terms of populations. They no longer distinguish species or types. Evolutionary theorists no longer speak of species or types but only of populations. There is no animal species or type, only animal populations or vegetable populations. In any case, the borderline is merely, I’d like… [Deleuze does not complete the sentence]\n\nAnd here I have a text by a famous mathematician called René Thom. Oddly enough, René Thom writes… Thom loves opposing military-type aggregates or societies to those of a more fluid nature. Which suits us fine. Military societies are typically arborescent – this too was part of last year’s seminar – power apparatuses are essentially ramified arborescent structures. So we’re OK with Thom’s premise. And he speaks of a multiplicity that suits us perfectly, a micro-multiplicity or molecular multiplicity: a swarm of mosquitoes.\n\nHere’s what he says: “Every individual in the group moves in an random manner” — that’s not what happens in molar societies or aggregates – “to the point where it can see the rest of the swarm in the same half-space”. [René Thom, Structural Stability and Morphogenesis, trans. D. H. Fowler (Reading, MA: Benjamin Fowler/Cummings, 1975), p. 319; see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 245)] This is perfect for us, you’ll understand… Every mosquito — and here Thom says something extraordinary — every mosquito is the borderline of the multiplicity of a mosquito swarm, and every mosquito in the swarm functions in its turn as the swarm’s borderline. That’s what can happen.\n\nWe saw another case, where a small military-type principle emerges, where the borderline is assured by a chief, a leader of the pack, a squad or gang leader. But in the mosquito’s case, every member of the group moves in a random way, unless it can see the others in the same half-space. Which means that if you follow the route of a mosquito or a fly – obviously it would be different if it was attracted by blood or a piece of flesh – but if you observe its random path, the rule of chance is that every mosquito will move up to a limit position. What is this limit position?\n\nIf we imagine a closed space, the limit will be the point where the mosquito finds itself so as to have all the others on its right, for example…You follow me? At that moment, its position will be on the borderline, and Thom says: “At this point it hurries to re-enter the group. In this example, stability is assured in catastrophe…” — an important concept for Rene Thom, who has a mathematical concept of catastrophe — “In this example, stability is assured in catastrophe by a barrier…” There’s no better way to describe the borderline. A gang or band has a number of dimensions determined by a maximal dimension: the borderline. In the case of the mosquito swarm, the borderline can be precisely defined as the line in function of which a mosquito situated on it will see all the other members of the swarm on one side, at which point it re-enters the swarm.\n\nIt’s interesting, this position of being on the borderline… we should take advantage of it. Being on the borderline, being on the borderline… Being on the borderline means to be part of the gang while not being inside the gang. Being on the periphery, then re-entering the gang before going back to the periphery. But I wonder… isn’t it typical when you are part of a gang, this fact of occupying the position of the borderline? At the limit, as Thom says of mosquitoes [Pause as Deleuze tries to find the quote], as Thom says of mosquitoes [Pause as he continues looking, then sits back trying to remember] ah, yeh, yeh, yeh [Pause as he continues reflecting] … oh I don’t remember, I don’t remember… As Thom says of mosquitoes [A woman student says something] Yes! It’s that every mosquito, insofar as being part of a swarm, occupies the borderline position.\n\nIn a novel – and here I’ll pass quickly on to literature, since I don’t see any difference between a phrase of Thom and one of a novelist, though I see the difference in treatment.\n\n– Yes… what is it? There are two books by Thom which are easy to find, then there’s an article… let’s see if I have the reference… and a book called Morphology…\n\nA student: Morphogenesis?\n\nDeleuze: Morphology… he’s got it wrong… it’s called Structural Morphology… He’s wrong, it happens to everyone…  it’s called Structural Morphology and… I can’t remember, I’ll tell you later… [Tape interrupted] [54:00]\n\nIn Mrs. Dalloway we have what Virginia Woolf presents as an extraordinary walk. [On the “walk” in Mrs. Dalloway, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 263] Each word here is important… and in the words of her heroine she says that following that walk her problems had dissolved, disappeared, she had had many worries, a lot of problems and she realized that these problems were of little account, they concerned the choice of who she should have married, who she should have left etc. And they didn’t make much sense anymore.\n\nIt’s curious that a walk could resolve her problems. It can happen… maybe it’s no longer the same scale, maybe it’s not just a simple walk but a fantastic molecular adventure that have swept away or transformed the burdensome molar position of these problems. Should I marry or remain single, should I stay a man or become a woman, should I finally grow up etc. All kinds of molar problems, but in the end, maybe, there’s a small particle that can make all this collapse.\n\nAnd Virginia Woolf, because it’s clearly her, and we’ll see why, she says that during this walk, which strangely takes place among taxis – there’s a continual passing of taxis… It’s interesting because taxis – and I’m not making this up – here I go back to science, and those scientists who have studied the matter closely… Taxis run on what are called semi-random routes, that is, the scientists…  Yes?\n\nA woman student: Can you speak louder? We can’t hear anything.\n\nDeleuze: Really… you can’t hear me? …\n\nThe student: [Inaudible reply]\n\nDeleuze (He pauses to reflect a moment]: The route a taxi takes on a day’s run is like that of a mosquito in its swarm: it’s a semi-random route, because how it continues its trajectory is in part determined by the point where the previous client got off. When a taxi is drawn towards a point on the borderline, where it has all the other taxis on its right, you’ll hear the driver say: “Here I’m going to get lynched!” – which is to say he is in a rough neighborhood where he wouldn’t normally venture. Actually, I hadn’t thought of that, it will be useful later on because we’ll be dealing with a story of criminal machines… but we haven’t got there yet, but we’ll get there.\n\nSo, here we have Virginia Wolf’s walk among the taxis but she’s not in a taxi, she runs into a number of people, and she walks in a way that’s literally the way they say only the English and Americans walk. You know, a walk by Henry Miller — we’ve already talked about this — isn’t the same as a walk by Michel Butor — which isn’t to badmouth Butor… but they don’t walk in the same way. Americans, English don’t stroll in the same way. Henry Miller doesn’t take a stroll around Clichy the way a Frenchman would in New York — unless he has a particular gift for it — it’s different, neither better nor [worse]. Usually, a French stroll would be more molar. The molecular stroll is a curious thing. [On Miller’s stroll, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 482]\n\nSo anyway, Woolf says, I sliced like a knife through everything… It’s a lovely phrase in a walk, “like a knife through everything”. Then she says — I know it almost by heart since I memorized it last night, [Laughter] since the book was heavy, and I didn’t want to have to bring it along — She also says: “I am a mist”.  There you have a molecular multiplicity. “I am a mist laid out among the people I know”. A beautiful phrase that… even more so because it’s not just literature – that really is how she lived, like a mist laid out among those she knew. I’m like a knife that slices through everything, that plunges into things, cuts between things. I’m… I don’t know what, a mist laid out between people. But then she says: “and at the same time I’m on the outside”, [Pause] and at the same time I remain on the outside. [On this quote from Mrs. Dalloway, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 264]\n\nThis is an odd kind of position… it has to be explained. How is it possible? It’s strange because I don’t have the words to describe it in terms of a molar multiplicity. If I try to describe it in such terms, what will the binary machine of the molar apparatus say? It will say: “what you doing is pure literature.” You’re either outside or inside – or you’re on the periphery. You are either one of us or a foreigner from elsewhere – or you’ve been placed on sentry duty to make sure outsiders don’t get in.\n\nAnd although here we have a third term – we’ve seen it so I won’t go back over it; we studied at the beginning of the year – this third term refers to a binarism, in the form of successive binary choices. First binarism: You’re either inside or outside. Second binarism: You’re (either inside or outside), this time in parenthesis – or you’re a sentry. So there is a first level of choice, then a second, but each time the choice is binary, so the three terms don’t change the binary nature of the choice.\n\nThus in terms of a molar multiplicity we will always have to say that this position cannot even be expressed, which is why we need three pages of a writer like Virginia Woolf to try to let us feel it and to try to reawaken a small particle in us – I’m weighing my words here – literally a tiny particle that can say “But of course, this is how I live”. The particle that is always on the borderline of the multiplicity to which it belongs — I can’t think of a more precise formula for the moment — a particle that is always on the borderline of the multiplicity to which it belongs. [On the borderline linked to Woolf’s walk, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 29]\n\nYet we still have a small problem. We have two cases: it can be any particle whatever, as in the case of a mosquito, any mosquito whatever, since every mosquito will take up this position. Or it can be a monster mosquito, a mutant. Moby Dick, the head wolf. Ok… for the moment I’m done with the story of the borderline. You can ask me questions in a minute if you like. But I just want to finish this.\n\nFor the moment, I will say that the borderline is perfectly embodied in any particle whatsoever, molecular multiplicities are a kind of multiplicity whose elements remain on the borderline of the multiplicity so formed. So it’s by determining the position of the borderline that you know the number of dimensions the multiplicity has. If you don’t keep to the position of the borderline, you remain stuck in the molar, in the big molar aggregates.\n\nBut keeping to the borderline — you know where I’m heading… — perhaps there is a relation between what we called lines of flight and the borderline. Perhaps there’s a rapport, since the particles on the borderline, and whose path is the borderline… what can we say about these particles? It was through these particles that I defined the multiplicity in question. I can say that they function as a provisional stabilizer, a temporary stabilizer… Moby Dick functions as a temporary stabilizer of the school of whales, the head wolf serves as a temporary stabilizer of the pack. Remember what Thom said? That stability is assured in catastrophe by a barrier that assures a discontinuity in behavior. It’s a question of assuring stability. [On the borderline and the question of stability, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 245]\n\nSo I’d say that it’s a local temporary stabilizer, but it’s not only that. There’s a whole other aspect to it, namely, it causes the multiplicity slip inside another, that is, through the borderline, on one hand the multiplicity is stabilized, on the other the borderline is in relation with other borders, it prolongs itself through other borderlines, which, since they contain other dimensions, provoke a metamorphosis, a transformation of the molecular multiplicity in question into another molecular multiplicity.\n\nWe began from a single, determinable multiplicity without yet knowing how to define it. Then we noted how it is the borderline that determines a molecular multiplicity. However, molecular multiplicities transform into each other, since their own borderlines communicate across the border, they form with one another. As though they were thresholds, doors from one border to another, such that below a certain threshold the border defines a given multiplicity as a local stabilizer. Whereas beyond the threshold you already have another border defining another multiplicity, and these multiplicities are such that one is transformed into the other. At the limit, we would have to regard this as a kind of slippage of borders, a superseding of thresholds.\n\nTo take a rough example from science that refers to an important question: physicists and chemists are now saying that no ramified arborescent schema takes these kinds of phenomena into account. As an example, they refer to transformations of the type “sol”-“gel”, which is to say the transformation from the state of a solution to that of a “gel”. In “sol”- “gel” transitions, the solution state is actually a type of multiplicity, while the gel state constitutes another type of multiplicity. It’s a question of showing how a borderline surpasses a threshold. They call this the percolation threshold, to employ an admirable term that Félix Guattari learned from some of his specialist friends. [See Guattari, The Machinic Unconscious, trans. Taylor Adkins (1979; Cambridge MA: MIT Press/Semiotext(e), 2011), p. 345 note 11, where Guattari refers to “effects of percolation” as synonymous with “phase transitions”] We have to know why this is. They claim that it’s impossible to translate it in terms of arborescent schema. It’s interesting how here they require a sort of machinic notion in contrast to the arborescent model. This is important but I’ll leave it aside for the moment, though I’ll come back to it in the context of literature, or if you prefer, but… [Deleuze does not complete his thought]\n\nIn chemistry and physics, in the whole field of phase transitions, we see one molecular multiplicity passing into another just as one borderline approaches another. Crossing a threshold, passing through a door – whether a threshold of percolation or something else, it doesn’t matter – but it doesn’t just happen at random.\n\nI’m almost done so I’ll be quick… This slippage of borders doesn’t happen in all fields but only on condition that the bordering molecular multiplicities change their nature, are transformed into one another. You’ll tell me that we need to provide some examples, fine… [Tape interrupted] [1:08:05]\n\n… so I’ll take a seemingly fantastic example — so much the better — that of werewolves. Werewolves, werewolves… when they die they turn into vampires. So what! – you might say – that’s nothing, it’s not science. But here I’m giving you a foretaste of the literature we will need. Werewolves turn into vampires — I’m not exaggerating — werewolf and vampire stories are of interest to us because the werewolf multiplicity is also a question of the pack. One werewolf is meaningless. It’s a question of epidemic, of contagion. Not filiation. It works. There’s no filiation, we already saw that when we were studying it. There is always a pact of alliance. [On werewolves and sorcerers as well as pacts and alliances, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 245-247]\n\nBut a pact of alliance with what? Here’s where demonology can serve us as a transition, a bridge between science and literature. What is the pact of alliance that is made by someone who becomes a werewolf? It occurred with the devil, or a sorcerer. Now what is the devil? With respect to our dear Lord, the good molar creature, the enormous molar creature, the devil is typically molecularized, he’s even named on account of this. The Devil, in his molecular aspect, let me think… he’s called Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies. One of the Devil’s main functions is to be Lord of the Flies, that is, of molecular multiplicities. They didn’t have the term for it then but when they said Lord of the Flies that’s what they meant.\n\nHe has many other names, having many functions, but in the end, what is this alliance with the Sorcerer? I’d say that the Sorcerer or the devil occupies the position of the borderline. It’s the monster, it’s Moby Dick, the Moby Dick of the universe… An alliance is formed, a bridge type of phenomenon an alliance is formed, a bond — we can use several different words — an alliance is formed, and one becomes a werewolf…  But the werewolf is at the same time a full member of a multiplicity. And because this multiplicity is a molecular multiplicity, even if the werewolf is big — I say this because we’re defining our multiplicities through different references of scale or size… — because it’s a molecular multiplicity, being a member of this Pack or multiplicity, the werewolf is always at the borderline of the multiplicity he forms with other werewolves. [Pause] And the werewolves are themselves at the borderline; the aggregate of werewolves, they are at the border of the multiplicity they form with other wolves, the multiplicity of wolves. [Pause]\n\nBut here is where things get complicated. Because when they die, according to many traditions, werewolves become vampires. And vampires belong to a completely different multiplicity. Researching this, it’s interesting how, for example, the werewolf multiplicity, or gang or pack, differs from the multiplicity of the vampire set. Here we have a nice example of the transformation of one multiplicity into another through the prolongation of a borderline where the devil, the sorcerer etc., don’t perform the same function.\n\nHowever, one border can slip inside another and there can be a rupture and then another into yet another. Each time you have this meshing of borders… we can speak of fiber – hence the expression many physicists use today, when they speak about the fibers of the universe. This is interesting because the current theory of fibers in physics has established itself in opposition to a typically molar theory: brick theory. Generally speaking, brick theory states that what is most material — physical matter — has the form of brick that enters into the construction of more precarious fragile structures, such as living structures. The theory of fibers is completely different. It consists in establishing lines of continuity between elements that are taken up in terms of their own individuality. For example, the lines of continuity that run from a higher living organism to atoms, which we are told are too tiny to be subjected to the law of large numbers – “too tiny”, we’ve seen this in Schrodinger’s formula – too tiny to be subjected to the law of large numbers. This is important because the law of large numbers, statistics, is still a molar method… [On the theory of fibers, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 249-251, 272] [Tape interrupted, end of Part I] [1:14:59]\n\nPart II\n\n[Given that a seemingly different drawing is on the board and that different students are sitting behind Deleuze from one part to the next, this segment could be occurring on a different day, despite its evident connection to the previous discussion]\n\n… I would say that gangs are molecular multiplicities. Not because they are small but on account of their non-molar type of organization. A gang is first of all defined through its borderline and the way that each of its members conducts their business at the borderline: the members of the gang leave, and then they re-enter, each bringing in the swag, and the swag is redistributed. Obviously, there is also a central position. There are centers and it’s because of these virtual centers in the gang that it risks becoming arborescent, going over to the other side, towards a type of organization that resembles a molar aggregate.\n\nBut, generally speaking, everyone in the gang conducts their own business and at the same time it’s everyone’s business. There exist contractual rapports, relations by contract or by alliance, relations of debt, counter-debt, all kinds of weird relationships. I’m told that even in groups of drug addicts there are odd relationships of debt and alliance.\n\nBut what is strange is the way the gang is always threatened, not only from the outside by pressure from the molar aggregates, but also from the inside. Gangs are threatened from the inside by phenomena of massification or leadership, the reconstitution of a central leader or worse, of a kind of group Oedipus. For example, when a woman in the gang takes on a maternal role, she institutes a kind of group mothering. I’ve seen this happen in certain communes, this fascinating phenomenon of group mothering that reconstitutes a center in the group. In this case, it’s as though the molecular multiplicity tended literally to arborify, to molarize itself, to attain the status of a molar aggregate. And this is always the way with molecular multiplicities, not because they are particularly fragile, but because it’s something that occurs in their very movement.\n\nSo, if we define molecular multiplicities by the segments that we’ve looked at – segments of a becoming-animal, a becoming molecular and so on, through the phenomena of the borderline, or of flight — I’m not going to go into that now… — we see they’re always in danger of vacillating, of being had, of going back to the side of the molar aggregates, the way the nomadic war machine went over to the side of the state apparatus even if it had a wholly different nature and function. But it’s the same with today’s gangs, like the War Machines of ancient times, it’s all as though finally… [Deleuze does not complete the sentence]\n\nThere are women in gangs who create a kind of… I don’t know, I imagine many of you have noticed things like that, these phenomena, literally, both how there’s often the two-fold danger of gangs and communities reconstituting both a kind of group mothering and a leadership… which is the reason gangs are always on the verge of becoming fascist, of recreating fascistic formations. In other words, it’s always like this but nothing is certain… You can’t say: “this is where the real revolution is happening”, not at all. There could be a reconstitution of a molecular Oedipus, and a molecular Oedipus is no better than a family Oedipus, a molar Oedipus. In fact, it can even be worse, so for example, you might have a female body that becomes the center of the gang. [On these kinds of reconstitution, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 214-216]\n\nI’m thinking of those American gangster films where the gang is led by the big mama. This is the danger the gang faces, that at its center a big black hole will begin to form. Usually this is how a gang collapses, either that or by rupture or a scattering of its members who get fed up, cross over the borderline and become part of another multiplicity, or else reconstitute a molar-type aggregate, even if it’s a small one. Once again you see how our molar-molecular distinction isn’t one between large and small numbers… [Tape interrupted] [1:20:47]\n\n… I would say that leaders in molar aggregates have an organizing function. In molar aggregates we recognize the boss from the central position they occupy, the central black hole. Or, if you prefer, the face, the function of a central faciality. I’m not at all saying it’s an individual; remember that the face function is never a individual function but a social production.\n\nSo there is the central face, like that of Hitler, for example, at the center of fascism, with its little orbiting satellites, little black holes around the big black hole: Goering-Goebbels. There’s this organization, the leader is essentially in a central position, to the point that the law of molar aggregates is always, it seems to me, of a type that tends towards the center, assuring legitimate ambitions, since it’s only by advancing in one’s career that one gets closer to the center. Otherwise, one remains far from the center.\n\nHere the center is on high because you always have a supplementary dimension in molar aggregates… there is a supplementary dimension in molar aggregates which is of course that of the profile or position of the leader. But it’s an interior and central position to which all the underlings try to get closer, except for those who are under orders to keep watch at the borders, although they’ll be relieved and their compensation will be to be able to see the leader and be led by him, that is to go back towards the center. So this is the position the leader occupies.\n\nI’m not saying that molecular gangs or groups, molecular multiplicities, don’t have leaders, but not surprisingly we need another word to describe them. There’s one excellent word that I hadn’t thought of last term and here I open a parenthesis. I spoke about Lovecraft because he’s an author I really admire, as many of you do, this American author, American – not English. Anyway, this great American author… what was I saying? Yes, he once wrote a book, no it was a story called… and I know I won’t be able to pronounce it properly — “The Outsider”, “Outsider”, as is said “outsider”. [See A Thousand Plateaus, p. 245] It’s translated in French, very badly as usual. Translators do things… you just need to know a little bit of a language to understand when a translation doesn’t work…. he translated the title as “Je suis d’ailleurs” (“I’m from elsewhere”).\n\nThis is important for us, for what we were saying about the becoming-animal in molecular multiplicities, quoting some passages from Lovecraft. [On Lovecraft’s animals, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 248] Because in this story, the outsider is what Lovecraft calls “the thing”, the “unnamable”, the human being in its becoming-beast, the becoming-animal of the human. He presents the outsider both as the thing and as a swarm. Remember our couple? The guide and the pack, the two together, Moby Dick and the school of whales, the devil and the pack of wolves and so on… And we understand what outsider means and that it doesn’t mean “I am elsewhere”.\n\nSo what is the outsider? Even in French I have the impression that it means, “the one you don’t expect”. But in what sense? I don’t even need to force language. Literally, it’s the one that exceeds or overflows, that arises from and spills over the border. The border-dweller, the being of the borderline is the unnamable, the one who literally delimits the swarming multiplicity. And if the multiplicity is superseded, it changes its nature and acquires another borderline. That’s what the outsider is.\n\nI’m saying, this is the position of the leader, but “leader” from the perspective of a molecular multiplicity, which is quite different from the leader’s position in molar aggregates. Here, the leader or guide of a molecular group is the one who is always at the borderline, as in the case of animal packs, where that’s found. We’d even have to see if we didn’t find the two-fold position of the leader in certain packs, already a kind of central leader, or central female, and then the border chief, a border guide who pushes back and guards the frontier. The border chief who stays at the borderline is the great Nomad. The one who stays at the center is the Chinese Emperor, if we want to refer to literature. Operating in a completely different way the nomad is the head of his war machine, which is itself a becoming, a molecular multiplicity, whereas the Chinese Emperor is the nominal head of the State apparatus.\n\nAlthough I’m here to defend thought, if someone told me that we need a leader… no, no, I’m… If I tell myself that a leader is necessary – and especially in certain circumstances, it can’t help but occur — it’s a statement that doesn’t mean much to me since, for me, the real question is what kind of leader will it be. Will it be the border-dweller, who will always occupy the position of the outsider? Or will it rather be the one who, in opposition to the outsider, we can call the “champion”, the man of central power who has a faciality function, whereas the border-dweller is typically without face, has literally lost his face? Perhaps he’s the one who makes greater use of secrets.\n\nSo, at this level too, we have to distinguish not only between two types of leader but between the way a molecular multiplicity refers to a pack leader, a peripheral chief, who we could define as an “outsider”, while molar aggregates refer to another type of leader. And we should also add that, faced with certain dangers or in certain circumstances, molecular multiplicities reconstitute leaders of the molar type and do so completely – even if they do it in a different way, depending on whether they rely on a border chief or else reconstitute a central leader typical of a molar aggregate… [Tape interrupted] [1:28:56]\n\n… I find it amusing how we are presented today with the history of psychoanalysis as supposedly beginning it creation, by recounting a number of little tales about what happened inside the school. They’re still cheating, of course. There was a first period which was more or less a period of censorship concerning what happened around Freud and his early disciples. But now we can finally understand what a mess all this was, quite a marvel. It was really one of these groups with Freud was the central leader. Fine.\n\nBut what interests me, once again – this is what I wanted to say earlier — I have no interest in the disciples; the disciples deserved what they got. What interests me is what was happening on the outside during that period. I have the impression that we still don’t really know. What was happening in Vienna around the time of the birth of psychoanalysis… what psychoanalysis, as it began to institutionalize itself, crushed in the different Viennese movements.\n\nHistory is normally examined purely in terms of geneses, as though on one hand you had the institution of analysis with its internal problems, and on the other a hostile external environment. But in my view this isn’t what happened. I just want to mention it… but there’s an Austrian scholar who’s been working on the matter for ten years – either he’s given up or there’s too much to say concerning the myriad groups that existed at that time. I’m not saying that Freud was plagiarizing what these groups were doing. I’m just saying that there was a flood of research. We only know of one borderline figure, Groddeck, but it seems there were many types of Groddeck around then, many, many, many. Psychoanalysis, perhaps without meaning to – without pretending to demonize it – was to crush all these movements. I can’t say it was necessarily a bad thing. I’m not saying, “Look what they did.” It rather a question of saying that’s how history always works… [Tape interrupted] [1:31:10]\n\nPart III\n\n[Again, as with the start of the previous part, Deleuze is surrounded by a different group of students in a different classroom configuration; hence, this seems to be a third, brief segment from another seminar session, which we have situated on the following Tuesday]\n\n… “They [the waves] told him that every figure of space” — every figure is a multiplicity, that’s what mathematicians say; a triangle is a multiplicity on every side, on all three vertices — “They told him that every figure of space” — therefore every multiplicity — “is but the result of” — I change my tone of voice when I’m quoting — “is but the result of the intersection by a plane [of some corresponding figure of one more dimension—as a square is cut from a cube or a circle from a sphere. The cube and sphere, of three dimensions, are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions that men know only through guesses and dreams; and these in turn are cut from forms of five dimensions, and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infinity.] [Tape interrupted, citation below] [1:32:09]\n\n… The world of men and of the gods of men is merely an infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal thing — the three-dimensional phase of that small wholeness reached by the First Gate, where ‘Umr at-Tawil dictates dreams to the Ancient Ones.” [This citation is from a story by H.P. Lovecraft and E. Hoffmann Price, “Through the Gates of the Silver Key” in The Dream-Quest of the Unknown Kadath (New York: Ballantine Books, 1970), pp. 191-192; cites several times in A Thousand Plateaus, see p. 251]\n\nYou understand? We’re saying that every multiplicity, every molecular multiplicity, can be defined by a number of dimensions. This number is determined by the position of what functions as the borderline of the multiplicity. [For this definition, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 249] I mean to say that the square and the circle are two-dimensional figures in function of their borderline, which is to say a line. Everything that is bordered by a line will have two dimensions. These are already multiplicities. There will also be three-dimensional multiplicities bordered by a surface and multiplicities of four or five, even ten dimensions. Here are examples of a multidimensional multiplicity, however varied: man, domestic animal-sheep, rat-bacteria, which creates contagion-plague, multiplicities with three types of werewolves, three types of vampires, and so on.\n\nSo, we have multiplicities of any type of dimension that transform into one another. This we’ve already seen. What we call plane of consistency or rhizosphere is the common intersection of all these multiplicities by a plane. You might say, “but the plane too has its own dimension.” No. It has to be a zero-dimensional plane. Not because it doesn’t have dimensions, but because it is able to cut through all the dimensions in such a way that the multiplicities that transform into one another never cease transforming. [Deleuze coughs] And their way of communicating is through this plane. Therefore, on the plane of consistency everything becomes abstract, in the cultural sense of the term. That is to say, the plane of consistency is the bearer of what Félix and I have been turning around this past year: the abstract machine. The universe is a Mechanosphere, not a noosphere or a biosphere. It’s a hypersphere, a Mechanosphere…\n\nWhat was I saying? The plane of consistency… ah yes, it’s the abstract machine because it gathers the ensemble of all the assemblages, of all machinic assemblages, of all multiplicities of whatever dimensions – and the dimensions of all these transformable multiplicities must exist precisely on this plane. The abstract elements of a single machine: a single Mechanosphere… [Tape interrupted] [1:36:02]\n\n… Virginia Woolf constructs the unity of her work [The Waves] on a single plane of consistency that advances and gathers all the multiplicities: the Bernard multiplicity, the Neville multiplicity, the Jinny multiplicity. And we have the impression that Percival is the extreme borderline, that Percival, the admirable Percival, almost merges with the plane of consistency. And yet, no. This is not what happens although some might think so. And Percival dies. He dies. [On The Waves, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 252]\n\nI brought you this wonderful page of The Waves. One of the characters is Rhoda. Following Percival’s death, she looks into what is a kind of lake where she sees forms appearing. She has the impression that one of these forms on the lake is Percival, even if she knows he is dead. And this is what she says. She describes the form she sees: “When the white arm rests upon the knee it is a triangle; now it is upright – a column; now a fountain, falling. It makes no sign, it does not beckon, it does not see us. Behind it roars the sea. It is beyond our reach.”\n\nGreat, don’t you think? Do you see this kind of curve? The same applies when it’s upright. It passes through all these multiplicities of increasing or decreasing dimensions, of variable dimensions. But they all somehow belong to the same plane of consistency. They’re all there, on this plane of consistency, but in the most abstractly real form, in the forms of pieces and cogs of the abstract machine. So Percival’s white arm will no longer be a knee or an elbow: it will be a triangle. This will no longer be… [Tape interrupted] [1:38:47]\n\n… I didn’t want to present an example from Kafka, but very quickly, I’ll tell you that she [Josephine] occupies exactly the same borderline position. What’s more, we learn that she is undoubtedly a singer, but that she doesn’t sing. [On this Kafka tale, “Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk,” see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 233-234] These are Kafka’s flashes of brilliance. So we shouldn’t confuse becoming-musical with making music, [Pause] just as we shouldn’t confuse becoming-mouse with imitating a mouse. Man becomes mouse and mouse becomes musical, but it’s man who makes music, and what does the mouse do? It’s a mystery. We’ll follow what it does.\n\nThis is what I call a bloc of becoming, the simultaneity of these two asymmetrical becomings. [On blocks of becoming, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 237, 307] When I say that there is a becoming-woman of man I don’t mean that symmetrically there is a becoming-man of woman. This was already almost the objection or question that was raised the last time. When I say that there is a becoming-animal of man, somebody said there was also a becoming- human of the animal. Yes and no. In fact, there is a bloc of becoming in which both becomings, both currents, are never symmetrical or parallel. – [Someone passes a sheet of paper to Deleuze] This is some kind of greeting… — Never parallel, never symmetrical, and in which each becomes something different from the other.\n\nThis is extremely complicated, this business of becomings, and we’ll have to explore it further. But in the case of Kafka, there is always a strange music and there’s a precursor for this. And yet he didn’t know the music of his time well, it didn’t interest him. But there are concerts in Kafka… Josephine sings and yet she doesn’t sing. It’s magnificent… [End of the recording] [1:40:51]\n\n \n\n"

Stivale\n\n[Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions]\n\nFélix Guattari: … to get an order of the world to function, systems of orders that order the world – the same type of promotion of invariants that constitute the co-ordinates of a single social, cosmic and affective plane…\n\nGilles Deleuze: Excuse me… Can everyone hear? Don’t you want to sit here? If you speak from the front everyone will be able to hear.\n\nGuattari: So I want to return to the example you proposed of the societies studied by Clastres… [Tape interrupted] [0:48]\n\nGuattari: … the supposed capitalisation of information through distinct units like letters, a highly purified articulation of phonemes with a policed syntax. But there’s also a whole series of semiotic components that contribute to something that isn’t a transmission of information but an expression of the libidinal life of the group. And this can express itself both through words and through mime, dance, tattoos, rituals and so on. This is what I call the different semiotic components.\n\nAt the end of the chain we arrive at an order whereby we can transmit something through a series of messages that are conveyed by computer. Today, to designate someone means taking a certain type of data and passing it through a computer. This will tell us not only a person’s physical location but also information about their various behaviors, degree of freedom, earning and spending power etc.  I would say that there’s been a semiotic collapse in the sense that collective modes of enunciation which inextricably wove and articulated together the various semiotic components have found themselves reduced to the point where they can always be translated in terms of a quantity of information.\n\nThe learning of language – the passage from infant to school to professional language and so on – is a process whose aim is to make individuals, however polyvocal their desires, capable of arriving at this possible reduction, which is essential to systems of production and exchange that can permit the circulation only of people who are translatable in terms of information. Otherwise, they must be mad, marginals, poets and what have you. Special tools are used to treat them and they are institutionalized in facilities specifically created to deal with these marginal phenomena.\n\nThis process of semiotic collapse makes it possible nowadays to enunciate any element of one’s desires or lifeworld, provided that it is compatible with the informatics machine of the system as a whole, whether that be socialist, capitalist, bureaucratic, all the state systems – to borrow Clastres’ classification. [On Clastres, see the A Thousand Plateaus seminar V, session 3 (November 20, 1979] So, all of a sudden, the only subjectivity possible is that which renders you compatible with the human species in general, the species of state-controlled societies and of citizenship. Therefore, you don’t have the same rapport with the particularization of enunciations which consisted in saying…. for example, Amerindians… Amerindian tribes say that the only “people” are Amerindians, and when they see white people they say they are not “people”. Their sense of belonging to a community of expression is delimited by the place where there is a mesh of the various semiotic components.\n\nExcuse me for this awful generalization. I know I’m taking two extremely different points in the social field. So what happens? One can submit to this system of computerized reduction only insofar as territorialities are constituted, what I call surfaces of redundancy, where we can articulate this type of opposition. To give an example: choosing a woman in the kind of societies described by Clastres isn’t simply a question of trying to have sex, or of reproduction, or of possessing somebody… it’s always a matter of the meeting of two social subgroups, implying different systems of exchange, systems of multiple semiotic composition.\n\nToday, we can say that the selection of a sexual partner – which seems to be a free choice – is in fact determined by systems that compel people to correspond to specific socio-economic profiles. To the point that there are some who try to facilitate this through a computer program that matches people’s preferences. However, one no longer chooses someone from a certain clan with all that this intricate semiotic dance implies. Perhaps one no longer chooses – and here I’m jumping ahead – a body, the possession of the other’s sexual organs – if we want to define it like that – but the possibility of finding a certain type of redundancy: redundancy of survival, redundancy of faciality. We look for someone in the enunciative field that allows us to say something of the order: Tristan-Isolde, Isolde-Tristan. But in a much more sad and sinister way, as in an endless conjugal scene that consists only in the person one is talking to. [On this topic, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 132-133 where Deleuze and Guattari speak of redundance and conjugal love]\n\nWhen I return, announce my name, and my objective, who is it that resounds the echo of what I’m saying? On which surface of redundancy can I express myself?  In territorialized societies you have large surfaces of redundancy and multiple possibilities of semiotic composition. In the case of conjugal relations, in a deterritorialized, miniaturized subjectivity, one can only latch onto this someone and say: “Do you recognise me when I speak to you?”, “I’ll be back at such and such time”, “That’s what I’m doing”. But the same system operates with children. Even in rapports of faciality, there’s this dissociation, this type of imprinting that ethologists refer to. The rapport of visual contact, the “eye to eye” contact of which Spitz and a number of other Americans speak. [On Spitz, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 169]\n\nThere’s always a need to frame things. I exist only as long as there is a certain point that serves as a surface of reference and black hole where I can go on articulating my enunciations. If this last surface of redundancy or reference is taken away from me, the whole system of my informational coordinates literally collapses.\n\nStrangely, we see that this thing psychoanalysts call the partial object — the eyes, the face, the eye-nose-mouth triangle — constitutes an extraordinary safeguard with respect to different individuals, since not only have the various semiotic components (dance, mime, gesture, group rituals and so on) largely disappeared, but also the possibility of the sexual act itself. We get to the point where one can conceive of falling in love with a trait of faciality in a woman, without having the chance to bring into play the various semiotics of love, sexuality and so on. The essential thing is that there be this last hold, this hook of territorialization. So there you have it.\n\nThe second thing we can sketch out for the moment is this: either you have informatics redundancies that latch onto surfaces with black-hole systems such as faciality, state power… In every system of power there’s always a system of black holes – the eyes of Giscard d’Estaing, the eyes of the leader… Something like, “In any case he’s one of us”, “There’s a chance, at least it’s France!”, “I recognize myself there because I’ve already seen him, I can continue speaking, producing meaning” …\n\nEither you have this system of redundancy-black holes – which is precisely the arborescent system, because wherever there’s a black hole there are trees – and, as we said in the case of dreams, you have the dream’s umbilicus, a place where everything is organized around a central point, a blind spot. Or we can think of another system of redundancy, though in this case it wouldn’t be a redundancy of orders or of subjectivity but a rhizomatic system where there is no black hole or else where the various black holes are bypassed in such a way that we return to a semiotic polyvocality – one no longer subjected to arborescence and the stratification of the various semiotic components, but where every type of expressive element (verbal, bodily, dance, sexual and so on) rather than contributing to the organization of a subject or a couple produces something that I think you (Gilles) are going to unpack, another type of semiotic organization, one that is no longer informatics-based but which we could roughly call diagrammatic. One that wouldn’t be centred around a black hole or pass by way of the mediation of a subject or relationship with another person, but through direct connections between the different semiotic components…  [Tape interrupted] [11:00]\n\nDeleuze: … since these redundancies of resonance with their faciality, the traits of faciality that compose them, find their outlet, their organization, in this whirlpool system that I called holes… Here, Félix adds a qualification, that we should call them black holes. And I remind you, for those who may not know this… but then you should try to find out more for yourselves, because that’s how we can work together… I remind you that black hole is an expression taken from astronomy. What black hole designates – and Félix will correct me if I’m wrong – is more or less, in the field of relativity… though it depends on which theory of relativity… it’s a star that has passed beneath its critical radius and in so doing, by diminishing this critical radius, surpassing a threshold, has acquired a strange property: it captures what are in this case photons passing nearby and retains them. It captures them and nothing gets out any more. And this is the reason that it doesn’t emit… it doesn’t emit light, it doesn’t emit photons… hence the expression black hole.\n\nWhen Félix plays on this, and this is true of our method as a whole, what we’re formally saying is: these are not metaphors. And if we say the face, the eyes are black holes, if we say that consciousness, I-equals-I, is a black hole, then the problem is how to get out of this. As I said before: how do we break through the wall, how do we get out of the whirlpool of the hole?\n\nIt’s not a question of saying black hole in a metaphorical sense. It’s a question of stealing a word, in this case a word from astronomy, ok we’ll take it, we’ll pick it up and we’ll keep it for our own uses but not as a metaphor. We will proceed neither by metaphor nor by metonym. We will proceed by using an inexact term to say the exact thing. Which is: the eyes, the face, consciousness… And we will say: consciousness is a black hole, the eyes are black holes and many other things besides. Memories are a black hole.\n\nAs Félix said, with regard to Proust’s madeleine when somebody raised the matter… “What is this business of the madeleine”? Félix put it admirably. He munches on his madeleine. It’s a redundancy, a type of redundancy perhaps. He has plunged into a black hole. The black hole of memories. How will he get out? Don’t think this is a victory for him. You recognize Proustians by the way they regard the story of the madeleine as a victory. And we recognize the anti-Proustians, those who really love Proust, who suffer for him, saying “Oh no, what a mess he’s getting himself into. How is he going to get out?”\n\nWell, he’ll get out in his own way, by making a hell of a din. He does what Félix has just said: He makes a line of flight out of the black hole, he bursts, springs out from the black hole exactly the way others manage to break through the white wall, the way Gherasim Luca does. So I think that in the last part of what Guattari said what will be fundamental for us, and he will have to develop it further, is both the topic of faciality and that of black holes… [Tape interrupted] [15:00]\n\nDeleuze: … In the conception of power that we require everyone, in a certain sense, is a messenger. You’re right, everyone’s a messenger, there’s no front line, it’s clear. So, it’s language itself that is the messenger of a pre-existing order, which nonetheless doesn’t exist outside of language.\n\nYolande Finkelstein: Regarding the categorization I was thinking of a parallel with what your friend whose name I don’t remember… who recites his poem…\n\nDeleuze: Yes, I’m happy to repeat that. I would add that, not by chance, he’s called Gherasim… a well-known first name… Luca, L-U-C-A. He’s written many poems, a number of wonderful collections published by Soleil noir: Le chant de la carpe (The Song of the Carp) and another whose title escapes me… [Tape interrupted] [16:25]\n\nDeleuze: Today I want to begin like this. I’ve quoted some fairly unremarkable examples of redundancy. But we’re not even sure that this is redundancy. [Tape interrupted] [16:46]\n\nDeleuze [He reads a text apparently by André Martinet, but it is often difficult to grasp when the reading stops and when Deleuze speaks in his own voice]: “Units of information that are independent and then probable, faced with which we are obliged to make choices. So at the other pole what is there? At the other pole you have what computer scientists call noise.” Already we’re wary and with good reason. We’re not doing computer science here. So it’s good to be diffident. We know that when computer scientists use the word noise, they’re talking about a very particular type of noise. It goes without saying that they oppose to information a noise that is presumed to be non-informative, or that contains the minimum of information, like radio or TV interference. But the noise of a beast that hides in the undergrowth is a noise that is rich in information. Even the noise of interference contains a minimum of information. For example it could be the enemy seeking to disturb a transmission. Even if we assume that it’s a random noise burst, it’s never completely fortuitous. We might consider the pole noise as the opposite of the pole maximal information. [Tape interrupted] [18:38]\n\nDeleuze: … Redundancy is presented as the diminution of theoretical information that is supposedly a priori by right. But something else appears at the same time. Redundancy is the only way of fighting against noise. Which is to say it’s the only way to save the information from crumbling, from disintegrating into noise. [Tape interrupted] [19:23]\n\nDeleuze: … Whether it be at the level of letters or that of phonemes makes no difference. A language contains a more or less large frequency of any given letter or a certain phoneme that it uses. For example the frequency of a given letter or phoneme are not the same in French as they are in English. So we can already begin a table of the comparative frequencies of letters or phonemes in a certain number of languages. We’ll call it a zero-order estimation. After which, the following estimation is already a redundancy: the frequency of a letter or phoneme in a given language.\n\nAnd then there is another estimation that we can call the first-order estimation. This time we study the frequency of a letter in a given language with respect to the preceding or subsequent letter. In this case too, depending on the language, the frequencies are different. I’ll give you a random example. In French what is the frequency of… we could also imagine a computer performing this kind of research… What is the frequency of the group B-A? That is an A preceded by a B. We could do similar studies in the case of phonemes.\n\nFor the second-order estimation I can look for frequencies concerning three groups of letters. This series of estimations will therefore define a certain type of redundancy… [Tape interrupted] [22:20]\n\nThe diminishing of absolute theoretical information and the struggle against noise… why are these two functions linked? Nothing would prevent absolute theoretical information from falling into pure noise if there wasn’t this regulating force of redundancy, which assures the struggle against noise by diminishing the level of absolute theoretical information.\n\nSo, we have a first schema, a schema of redundancy, where at the top we will put “maximal theoretical information” and below “noise” and between the two “redundancy”. And Martinet concludes: “The presence of redundancy is a way to permit the transmission of signs”, and this happens through the series of estimations of which I just spoke. [For this reference, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 530, note 30, to Martinet’s essay “Redondance”, in La linguistique, guide alphabétique (Paris: Denoël, 1969), pp. 331-333]\n\nThen Martinet identifies a second type of redundancy. He says: “Not only is redundancy a way to permit the transmission of signs but there is nothing to prevent it itself from becoming a sign”. There… you see how it constitutes a sign in its own right. Redundancy not as regulator of the transmission of signs – a regulatory process in the transmission of signs, or code for transmitting information – but it itself as a sign. Why is this?\n\nHe says: “It must be so that the user can seek out the redundancy for itself.” So users can look for the actual redundancy. “A means of expression for the individual, of manifestation of group consensus. We will therefore identify a principal function of combating noise, without which any communication would be impossible”. And this is our first case of redundancy. “And then there are secondary uses,” secondary uses, “which are left at the subject’s disposal. Means of expression, of action upon others, of enchantment”… [Tape interrupted] [25:34]\n\nDeleuze: … Reducing the second type of resonance to a secondary use of the first type may be correct from the perspective of informatics, but we’re not sure that what we are dealing with has anything to do with informatics. And perhaps we can even say that it isn’t correct from any perspective, particularly since it actually forms part of very different systems of signs: the subjective redundancies of resonance and the signifying redundancies of frequency. It’s by no means sure that they form part of the same system of signs. It’s by no means sure that the latter are simply a secondary use of the former. [Pause]\n\nAnd there’s another thing that disturbs me and that might disturb us all, but this time it’s not related to the second type of redundancy but to what popular informatics tell us about the first schema. For the moment I’m only going to speak vaguely about this… because I’d like to focus on it later. So you can clearly see that what I want to say about redundancies is that we still aren’t even sure what all these redundancies are. So far so good… [Tape interrupted] [27:22]\n\nDeleuze: … There’s a lot that can be said about the informative nature of language. A number of linguists have already spoken extensively about it. It’s interesting because the idea that language is by its very nature informative is one that corrupts us to such an extent that… I think of a case like that of Sartre, who at a certain point felt the need… and I don’t think he would say this now… to identify what it was that characterised language, or to be precise, poetry or literature. And he said that literature and poetry begin when there is information. Barthes too once said something similar. It’s very odd to make this kind of affirmation. [Tape interrupted] [28:21]\n\nDeleuze: … What is it that has completely corrupted, compromised, putrefied even, the question of language-power relations? It’s the bad choice we’ve been left with, which is to say the very conception of power that has been proposed to us.  When we were told, “ah folks, it’s either infrastructure or ideology”, we were already pretty irritated. We were irritated for language’s sake, we were really irritated for language to be stuck with this alternative, even if it was presented in the most sophisticated way imaginable. Although sometimes it wasn’t presented in a very sophisticated way, yet in the end the more sophisticated the presentation the worse it turned out. Because we realised that this question of language was extremely complicated. It’s not infrastructure. No, it can’t be infrastructure. Language doesn’t produce anything. It produces only words. It doesn’t produce goods. No aspect of infrastructure coincides with language.\n\nSo, we wondered if it was rather a superstructure. In other words, is it the state apparatus that decides on language? Difficult to say.  As Stalin said: “No, we’ve changed everything but not Russian, not much at least. Of course, we’ve perfected it. But within certain limits”. So, it’s not the state apparatus. We don’t change language the way we change a constitution or a police force. So, is it ideology? “No”, he said. “It may be the vehicle of ideologies, but it can equally well be the vehicle of other things besides ideology.” So even ideology isn’t a strong candidate.\n\nSo, they said, so really, what is language? We always have to go back to this text because it’s both short and rather wonderful, the text Stalin wrote on linguistics, [See A Thousand Plateaux, p. 525, note 21, in Marxism and Linguistics (New York: International Publishers, 1951)] where he says: “Comrades, you’re wrong. There are those among you who say that language is infrastructure and they are mistaken, they are not looking at the question rationally. Others say that language is ideology and there is a language of the people, a proletarian language, a bourgeois language. I say that this not the case and that you don’t really see what is at issue, comrades.”\n\nAnd Stalin goes so far as to say that language is the common good of a nation, and that it ensures the communication of information. It suited him to say that of course, since it implied a conception of power related to our well-known themes of infrastructure, superstructure, ideology and so on. If we were to say instead that language has always been a system of order and not of information… that it is orders we are given, not information that is communicated, it would seem to us that we were saying something obvious. We turn on the TV news and what do we get? In the first place, we don’t receive information, we receive orders. And at school, what goes on? Here too it’s obvious. At school the children don’t receive information… The example of school is… Félix puts it well in a text he wrote… we put language in the mouths of children exactly the way we put shovels and picks in the hands of workers. [See A Thousand Plateaux, p. 76, for this same formulation]\n\nSo, fine, that doesn’t mean that language is an infrastructure but that it relates to the field of orders. When the teacher gathers the children together it’s not to inform them about the alphabet, it’s to teach them a system of orders. And we have to add – and here prepared to settle our accounts with the Chomskians which we’ll have to do later [Deleuze and Guattari undertake this in A Thousand Plateaus, plateau 4, “Postulates of Linguistique”] — that their famous phrase markers are above all markers of power. And that a syntax is a system of orders, a system of command that will allow or force individuals to form enunciations that conform to dominant enunciations. And the function of school is primarily this. So, language must be conceived first of all not in terms of information but in terms of order. Not in terms of communicating information but of transmitting orders.\n\nClearly, for us, this implies – and I would say this is simple and obvious – that we have to look for another conception of power, because, after all, Stalin is quite right in his remarks. There’s no one who decides syntax. Which means that power is undoubtedly something completely different to the properties of individuals or groups in a given moment. For the time being let’s just say that language is a formalization of expression. Not all expressions pertain to language. Language is a particular formalization of expression whose function is to transmit orders in a society. We know that this implies giving power another conception different from the Marxist conception. In this sense, language, including syntax, is… we can’t even call it an instrument… it’s an element and component of power. So, in this sense, it’s not informative.\n\nAnd yet, in a certain way it is. Which is to say that it provides the minimal information and guides the minimum choice necessary for the correct understanding of relative, limited information, relative to the orders that are given. It goes without saying that when someone on the street shouts “There’s a fire!” (Au feu!), it’s better if the kids don’t understand it as “Go and play!” (Au jeu!). So, there is of course information and there are choices and approximations, but which are nonetheless relative to the orders communicated by language. [Deleuze and Guattari give this example as well as the Carroll anecdote that follows in A Thousand Plateaus, p. 76]\n\nThere’s a letter… you know how Lewis Carroll used to write letters to little girls, never to little boys. And there’s a famous letter to a little girl he wrote – which is well known and well translated so we don’t need to read it English which would be difficult for some, myself included. This admirable translation by Jacques Papy that works by equivalences, you can find in various editions of Carroll’s Letters. It describes a situation that corresponds perfectly to what we’ve been discussing. [In fact, the translation into French is by Henri Parisot; Jacques Papy translated Alice in Wonderland]\n\nDuring one of his lessons in a high society context, the teacher is at the bottom of the garden. And there’s a first servant who repeats his questions. Everyone knows that a teacher’s questions are really orders. When a teacher asks a panicked child what 2 and 2 are, it’s clear he’s not asking for information, he’s giving an order. And you will tell me, but the child would have to be informed first. Indeed, the child has been informed by a previous system of orders. It’s always the information that presupposes the order and not the other way round. I don’t mean order in the sense of organization or ruling but in the sense of a command.\n\nSo, the first servant repeats the teacher’s question, then there is a second servant who repeats the question repeated by the first, and then a third and so on. And to mark the hierarchy that runs through language, the pupil is at the other end of the garden. And then he sends back his answer. And in Carroll’s letter, which I deliberately didn’t bring with me… you can look for it yourselves if you’re interested… the question is passed down the line, each time completely transformed, because the first servant didn’t hear properly. It begins with “what are 2 and 2”, the first servant deforms it and the question changes, the second deforms it further and the third even more. So what the pupil hears is a completely different question to which he anxiously responds, and the answer goes back up the chain.\n\nHere we have a whole system in which the choices are always wrong but are nonetheless determined by a chain of order and command. And so the obedient response is sent back up and is more and more wrong. The conditions of information are conditions of reception of orders and commands… [Tape interrupted] [40:23]\n\nDeleuze [He stands in front of the blackboard, and throughout this sequence, writes the terms between each response to the students] The schema has three heads – [Someone tosses him some chalk from the back of the room] Thank you for the chalk — The schema has three heads — Maximal theoretical information — Noise which completely disturbs the emission and reception of information – Redundancy [Deleuze inserts arrows between each level] There we are. A struggle against the noise, letting us defeat the noise which diminishes at the cost of also diminishing the maximal theoretical information.\n\nThe two go well together, since without redundancy the maximal theoretical information would itself be noise. We are trying, in a crafty, underhanded way, to replace this with another schema. The orders-commands schema… You see immediately where I’m heading. I still don’t know exactly how but I feel… no, we feel… we all feel, that orders-commands – I’m not saying that these are different –that orders-commands contain, comprise and in fact result to be the same thing as redundancies, that an order doesn’t need to be repeated — if we repeat an order, it’s because the order is already redundant — so, redundancy or one type of redundancy is the form of the order as such; it’s the form of command.\n\nAnd generally speaking, it shouldn’t surprise us if this is the case. We shouldn’t be surprised when an order is repeated, if this is the way an order is given and received, for no other reason than to show that I have understood well. Like when someone says: “Come on, go and do such and such!” and I reply: “Yes, I’ll go and do such and such!” In this case I am superfluous. I redund, so to speak. But what do I redund? Redundancy… it’s the order itself. “Go and do such and such!” or “Go and play!” (Au jeu!) no… “There’s a fire!” (Au feu!) no… “Open fire!” (En joue le feu!) “Open fire!” The order has to pass down the line. So the general says “Open fire!” or “Weapons at the ready!”, or something similar, and the captain says “Weapons at the ready!” and the sergeant says “Weapons at the ready!” until the order arrives at the poor guys who have to prepare their weapons. But if the order is repeated, it’s because, in itself, it is redundant. The order, the command are forms of redundancy in themselves. Maybe.\n\nSo, [Deleuze turns to the board] we were saying that language is not information but order or command. And we also said that the pure order, the order-command in its pure state, is pure redundancy, absolute redundancy. And this is what we put at the top of our schema. Redundancy is the same thing as an order. So, to repeat: if order becomes redundancy, if it is repeated, it is because it is in itself redundancy. So, repetition as a practice with respect to the order would simply be a consequence of redundancy as iden… [Deleuze corrects himself] as within the nature of the order. It’s not certain, but that’s the sensation we have… there’s nothing we can do about it.\n\nHere, [Deleuze writes on the board] between the two… — the two what? I don’t know. Between the two… it’s just to make a well-balanced schema. We’ll see. — Between the two we’ll put “information”, which is always relative. If it’s true to say that redundancy is the absolute form of order, we will say that relative information is the limited content of an order in as far as it differs from another order. ABC is not the same thing as BCD. Ok, so we have relative information. You see that the form of order is absolute redundancy. So what follows is relative information. If the order didn’t communicate a piece of relative information, “Do this rather than that”, we would be in the same situation as Lewis Carroll’s teacher and pupil where we have the order that is passed down the line, an execution of the order – and an act of obedience which is completely different.\n\nInformation is merely the relative condition whereby the execution of the order corresponds to the order itself. It’s like an inversion of the informatics schema. Actually, it’s even worse. It’s a completely different field. So anyway.\n\nHere in this third position what can I put? It’s clear, it’s obvious, it’s obvious, and it’s also clear that this is how it works. Fine. [Deleuze writes on the board] It’s not noise that is an informatics abstraction. [Pause] It’s silence. But what silence? What does that mean? Why introduce silence here? Silence. [Pause] Silence is ambiguous. Because it could be the state of the person who obeys – but that is a silence of language, a silence of language itself that is included in language itself. It’s [Deleuze writes on the board] before, it’s before… it’s what happens between the reception of the order and the response to the order. The captain says: “Load your rifle!” and what follows is a silence filled with the sound of a rifle’s bolt action. And then the soldier says: “Ready, captain”. [Laughter] But there’s another silence, a silence that consists in something quite bizarre: an escape [fuite] from all this. We know this silence. When the captain says: “Ready, take aim, fire!” [Pause] And there’s nothing. [Laughter] Silence… [Tape interrupted] [49:24]\n\nDeleuze: … There’s no great composer who doesn’t have their techniques of silence. Here we can say something that everyone who listens to music will already be familiar with. Which is that music is traversed by a sort of vector of abolition. A vector of sonic abolition. As though it was completely intrinsic to music. The will and the movement to be extinguished [s’éteindre], and to extinguish us with it. Like a kind of tracing of abolition. And sounds – which are not a language, even if in music too there are orders but music flows underneath these orders that are properly musical – trace a line of abolition that is fully part of the music… and they do so in many ways.\n\nThis first system of signifying redundancy, or redundancy of frequency, inscribes itself on a semiotic wall. And the attempt to pierce this wall… we’ll call this attempt exiting from the signifier, from signifiance. Just as Gherasim Luca does.\n\nAnd then I’ll make a brief mention of the second type of redundancy. Obviously, once again, these are not secondary uses of the first type. This time we’re dealing with redundancies of resonance. Of course, we already know something in advance: that everything mixes, everything is mixed. There are no frequencies that don’t have resonance and vice versa. So it’s not a duality, even if it would be easier to proceed as if that were the case. Though if you tell me that it’s not a duality, I’ll say, no it isn’t. But at the same time, yes it is. And if you tell me it is, I’ll say no it isn’t.  Let’s try to work things out from there.\n\nRedundancy of resonance: what is it? As we saw, it’s not a secondary use. To use the language of linguists we would say that it’s neither a phoneme nor a morpheme, nor is it a word. So, what are we dealing with? Not surprisingly, the last two examples of redundancy that I quoted refer to something linguists call… something we’ve talked about at length… something they call “shifter”. Which is the redundancy – I-equals-I – of the personal pronoun. And the Tristan-Isolde / Isolde-Tristan redundancy of the proper name.\n\nAnd you know generally what the linguists call shifters. These are terms that designate those who are literally their bearers. The “I” designates the person who says “I”. This is not the case for other words, it’s not the case for common names. The dog in this case is not the word “dog”. But the word “I” designates the one who enunciates “I”, and we speak of this as a “shifter.” The proper name designates its bearer. Therefore, the proper name – like the personal pronoun, the “I” – are very special things that animate the second of the categories of resonance. And we’ve seen that our two examples of categories of resonance are probably closely connected – just like our two examples of categories of frequency. We have this consciousness that says “I-equals-I”, or we have this couple who say “I love you – I love you” or “I hate you – I hate you” or “I love you – I hate you” or “I hate you – I love you”. A redundancy. Or “Tristan – Isolde” … [Tape interrupted] [54:39]\n\nDeleuze: … Is this schema the same? Once again, what we had in the first schema was: redundancy of frequency, signifier inscribed on a semiotic wall, and the problem was how to pierce this wall to arrive… at something that might no longer even be semiotics. In any case, it will be an unformulated semiotics. In the other case – here I take up a hypothesis that Guattari is currently developing… is it the same case? Perhaps, but for our purposes it’s better to make distinctions. [Tape interrupted] [55:25]\n\nDeleuze: … This time the schema seems to me a little different. — Oops, I’ve lost the chalk… Thank you! — Tristan – Isolde. Or else we have “I-equals-I” … I would say that this time, in the redundancy of resonance, the resonance is assured by the elements in question – I and I… or in more technical terms “the subject of enunciation” and “the subject of the enunciated”. Tristan and Isolde, successively “subject of enunciation” and “subject of the enunciated” in their respective mouths. “I, Tristan, enunciate you Isolde”, but also “I Isolde enunciate you Tristan”. The subject of enunciation and the subject of the enunciated in the two cases of redundancy of resonance were as if attracted in a kind of vortex, a true hole. [Pause, he draws a circle with a spiral within it] They started to whirl around, to heat up inside this hole, [Pause, he begins whispering slowly while making a circular movement with his hand] I, I, I, I, I, I, … Tristan, Isolde, Tristan, Isolde, Tristan, Isolde, and the boat sails on, and the boat sails on, Towards what? Towards death. [Pause] The cogito doesn’t have a very bright future ahead of it. [Laughter, he turns toward the board smiling] In appearance, it’s a formally different system.\n\nI had, and here I would like to end: redundancy of frequency, signifier operating on a wall, a semiotic wall, with the crucial question of how to break through the wall. And here I have redundancy of resonance or subjective, that refers to a hole. [End of recording] [58:03]\n\n \n\n \n\n"

Purdue University Research Repository. doi:10.4231/A6MK-VP50\n\n\n\n\nGilles Deleuze\n\nDeleuze & Guattari at Vincennes, 1975-76\n\nIl Senso in Meno, Part 2 – Proust, Faciality and Power \n\nTranslation: Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; transcription and time stamp: Charles J. Stivale\n\n[Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions]\n\n \n\n[The film starts with Guattari in the process of discussing the scene in Proust’s Swann’s Way when Swann deepens his understanding of the musical phrase in the composition by Vinteuil; Deleuze and Guattari discuss this novel in terms of faciality in A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 185-187]\n\nFélix Guattari: … He was fleeing from everything. And this backfires on him. He’s completely terrorized, but at the same time fascinated because something appears: the little phrase no longer functions as a node of resonance that would fill in the wall of daily life but begins to live and throb in another way. First of all the musician plays it in its entirety, while traditionally only some elements of the phrase were kept, and a whole part was lost.\n\nProust, or rather Swann, says that “there were marvellous ideas” in its development. At first there was the repetition of the little phrase. The rest was a bit blurred, and he couldn’t really seize it. For the first time he realizes that regarding the rest of the piece: “There were marvellous ideas in it which Swann had not distinguished at the first hearing and that he perceived now, as if they had divested themselves, in the cloakroom of his memory, of the uniform disguise of novelty.”\n\nAn example of deterritorialization are certain musical signs that don’t function in systems of morphemes or phrases or systems of mathematical signs that function in equations, but that refer back to phrases or realities like those we experience in perception. I won’t go into this right now because I don’t want to dwell too much on deterritorialization…\n\nGilles Deleuze: Regarding this question, I’ll take up the example that Félix has just quoted of the monocles in the second part of Swann in Love. \n\nUp to then Swann had seen some faces, like the face of Odette. He needed to feed Odette’s face with pictorial reminiscences. A face by Botticelli. Then there was a kind of layering of the one on the other. One might say, looking for a logical definition, that the faces were seized in their territoriality. They were understood at first as faces – either faces on a canvas or faces in flesh and blood. This is the state of territorialization of the face, which like everything else has its territorial states.\n\nIn the second moment, at the end of the love story, Swann becomes immersed in something completely different, when he goes to a reception. There what he begins to see are no longer the faces of the valets but an actual defection of those valets’ faces that forms a kind of line. And he says this in the text, I remember…\n\nGuattari: I’ll read it afterwards.\n\nDeleuze: Yes, you can read the quotation later. What he more or less says is that those faces lost the normal faculty they would have had – it goes without saying this means territorially – of making someone recognizable… “Oh, it’s you, how are you?” They were just a system of lines. Let’s just say this for the moment. It’s a kind of state in which the face becomes deterritorialized. Then Swann enters the salon, and the same thing happens with everyone there. Here you have the series of monocles.\n\nThe monocle or a scar or a pair of glasses are normally themselves part of the cycle of ordinary redundancies. Glasses as a redundancy of the eye, monocles as a redundancy of the eye. They’re both ways of territorializing the face. Here, on the contrary, a line of deterritorialization is created, in which the whole of art is brought into play, as well as a new comprehension of Odette. It’s no longer art that falls back on her face, it’s her face that ends up dissolving. So, in this sense, we use the expression line of deterritorialization when this upending of the face occurs. The face is wrenched from its territoriality. It’s no longer a face. But as Félix says, it melts into traits of faciality. And that’s not all. What will these traits of faciality become?\n\nA student: Isn’t this portrait a bit like a mode of disinvestment?\n\nGuattari: Oh, no, not at all. Precisely not!\n\nDeleuze: There’s the same degree of investment in the other.\n\nThe student: You mean in Odette. But what about disinvestment in Swann?\n\nDeleuze: Ah… That’s accompanied by the disinvestment of Odette herself.\n\nThe student: But the final word of Swann’s love for Odette isn’t something we can take for granted, after all he marries her, actually after the conclusion of Swann in Love.\n\nDeleuze: Ok, I’m going too fast. Thanks…\n\nGuattari: Ok, listen, I just want to link that with what I’ve prepared, and then we can pick up again this particular discussion about investments. Even if Proust sometimes has the temptation to refer to things as entities of a black-hole type – such as memory – here suddenly he’s tempted to step into the shoes of the musicologist, as he attempts to make a dichotomous analysis of the little phrase. And he says: perhaps what gives me “that impression of a frigid and withdrawn sweetness” is the “closeness of the intervals between the five notes” and the “constant repetition” of each one of them. Then he stops and says, no it’s a “mysterious entity,” it’s something else, a different universe. [Proust, Swann’s Way, trans. C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin, revised D.J. Enright (New York: The Modern Library, 1998), p. 496]\n\nThere are different universes, species of bodiless entities created by artists like Vinteuil. And he accepts them as such. He says it’s an experiment. They’re not ineffable beings. He evokes the experiments of Lavoisier and Ampere. [Swann’s Way, p. 499] Vinteuil has experimented with something quite extraordinary here. Proust says, “even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed latent in his mind on the same footing as certain other notions without material equivalent, such as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of physical pleasure.” [Swann’s Way, p. 497] And here he has a kind of anti-cogito reaction. He recovers, he doesn’t fall into the black hole, and he says how usually the soul is something we think about as similar to nothing. But then certain composers show us the theme they have discovered, of showing us “what richness, what variety, lies hidden, unknown to us, in that vast, unfathomed and forbidding night of our soul which we take to be an impenetrable void.” [Swann’s Way, p. 497] And at this point he says, we can’t doubt the existence of this kind of, I would say, machine, of this machinic bloc, we can’t doubt it any more than we can “doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has been lit”. [Swann’s Way, p. 498] It’s as if he was questioning the reductionist procedure of Descartes. He says that what is at stake here is “an order of supernatural beings.” [Swann’s Way, p. 497]\n\nThe last point regarding this deterritorialization beginning from the musical phrase is the loss of the subject, the loss of the subject that is already sketched out in the iconic component through the redoublings, the lines, the proliferation of character portraits. Here, all of a sudden, the little phrase becomes the subject of the enunciated. It’s the phrase itself that begins to speak, and the little phrase looks at the people around it, judges them, has its own opinions about their state of mind. It completely changes position with respect to the previous subject. There’s a new assemblage. It’s the little phrase that reorganizes the subjectivity of the people gathered in the salon and that of Swann himself…  [Tape interrupted] [8:20]\n\nGuattari: … He describes a dream; in the dream we see the traits of faciality completely collapse: at a certain moment, he sees Mme Verdurin “who fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment” – so he goes back to the Verdurins as if nothing has happened – “during which he saw her face change shape, her nose grow longer”, and he sees her sprouting a large moustache. Swann is horrified, he turns and sees Odette who is as she was before, tender, loving, her eyes are in tears “eyes welling with affection”, and he says, these eyes “are ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face.” [Swann’s Way, p. 539] The eyes are just about to fall on Swann.\n\nEverything is replayed in an enormous wave of tenderness. But then Odette says: “I have to go.” Swann is speaking to Mme Verdurin, and Odette leaves without fixing another appointment with him. She leaves together with Napoleon III who happens to be there. The series of monocles continues, the series of generals, of moustached faces. And in that moment, the whole of faciality collapses, and with Odette, it’s over, and Swann says: “he hated Odette, he would gladly have gouged out those eyes which a moment ago he had loved so much, have crushed those flaccid cheeks.” [Swann’s Way, p. 539] [Tape interrupted] [9:46]\n\nDeleuze: How does his life fall into a hole all of a sudden, without him foreseeing anything? Why all at once? It could have been something else and not Odette and Swann. Last Tuesday we spoke about black holes. [Tape interrupted] [10:04]\n\nDeleuze: … Let’s imagine that there’s a moment that functions like a black hole and like subjective redundancy. We will have to go back to the text… If you’re interested it’s a good chance to reread some passages of Swann. It seems to me that the system of redundancy: Odette-Swann continually reappears…  [Tape interrupted] [10:37]\n\nDeleuze: … In Swann’s case, what interests him above all is painting. When he sees a little maid, he thinks of… it’s a strange thing, because this really is redundancy, redundancy of resonance. I need it to remind me of something. If it doesn’t remind me of anything I’m lost. For him the essential thing is that a thing reminds him of a great painting. Then it works. So, what does he do? In the centre you have… I’m simplifying… in the centre are the two faces. But there’s a crisis here. It’s not so simple. Once again, let’s not forget our method. There’s no good or bad. We can’t say black holes are no good. It’s not easy to make yourself a black hole. It’s love-passion. [On love-passion, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 133-133, and for Swann, pp. 186-189]\n\nSo, we have these two faces: Odette and Swann. And it doesn’t entirely work. It envelops, following a line of life. Swann resorts to his procedure, surrounding it with another line, the line of art, so as to close it in completely, and to constitute the black hole of love-passion. So, we have Odette-Botticelli, Botticelli-Odette. This changes everything. She reminds me of something… Redundancy. The redundancy of Odette’s face and Swann’s face. The redundancy of the flower given by Odette and the flower given by Swann. [Tape interrupted] [13:00]\n\nDeleuze: … The line of art intervenes to surround and to guarantee the enveloping of the lived line, in such a way that it clearly reminds me of something. Swann is really sucked into the black hole. But then he makes this astonishing encounter, which doesn’t form part of his procedure. All this is part of lived experience. Our procedures are always surpassed. We use them to surpass what doesn’t work in experience and then they themselves are surpassed by something that is perhaps like a proper name. Swann hears Vinteuil’s little phrase. It’s a third line, a musical line. Vinteuil’s little phrase has moved him.\n\nBut in which form has it moved him? It has moved him because he says to himself: “All this is unexpected. It’ll allow me to go right to the end of love-passion. And he uses it as a kind of third line that will bind all the lines. It will assure the love-passion black hole and will have, to go back to my drawing from earlier [Deleuze moves to the board] — I don’t know, what was it I did here, well anyway – [In what follows, he traces with his finger across the previous drawing] Swann, Odette, their tumbling towards the black hole of love-passion through the lived line of the two faces, the necessary pictorial line, the musical line – and there has to be a system of perpetual redundancy from one line to another. To the point where, at this level, Vinteuil’s little phrase will be ripped from the piece it belongs to. It will have a value, like a signature tune on the radio or TV.\n\nVinteuil’s little phrase springs up and Swann looks at Odette. Odette looks at Swann. The phrase makes redundancy with the pictorial signs; it makes redundancy with the faces to the point where it becomes a sign between the two, to the point that he doesn’t give a shit about the rest of Vinteuil’s great sonata. “Ah, my little phrase!”, Odette winks. “Do you remember our little phrase,” and he says: “Yes, the little phrase”. It’s the system of subjective redundancies… [Tape interrupted] [16:07]\n\nYolande Finkelstein: I’d like to say something.\n\nDeleuze: About the drawing? Ok.\n\nFinkelstein: There’s a drawing I’d like to make.\n\nDeleuze: Ah, you have the chalk…\n\nFinkelstein: It goes like this: Odette, Swann, and from then on it’s the same drawing as the one you did. Meaning that from now on… I can’t even say it.\n\nDeleuze: You feel you want to add a vertical line.\n\nFinkelstein: I mean there is a separation…\n\nDeleuze: Ok, ok.\n\nFinkelstein: There’s a separation, here’s Odette, here’s Swann, and on each side, we can make the drawing you made but there’s a moment when…\n\nDeleuze: We’ll deal with it like that.\n\nFinkelstein: … when there’s a terrible fracture, which isn’t of the same order as the relation between art and music.\n\nDeleuze: Indeed, we need that for the second moment. We can add it. Without further commentary. Like that it’s perfect.\n\nFinkelstein: Yes, those are across. [Referring to the connecting lines that Deleuze draws]\n\nDeleuze: There you have it. That’s the cowardice of women for you.\n\nAnother student: Let’s suppose that Swann’s signs of love for Odette, let’s suppose a superposition of sense for the signs of the Verdurins’ salon. In that case all the signs of love emitted by Swann towards Odette enter not into a deterritoriality, but in a territoriality of the signs of Verdurin. So, well no…\n\nDeleuze: Fantastic! I think that suits me perfectly. We need this. As you said, in the first moment it’s the system of black holes that belongs to the territoriality of the Verdurins, with some nuances.\n\nThe student: But this screws up the possibility of speaking of aesthetics and of Swann’s aestheticism. What does Swann’s aestheticism mean? For us Beethoven, or Wagner for the Verdurins relate to a single sign of communication. And the same occurs in the case of the Guermantes. That’s why we can’t speak about deterritoriality.\n\nDeleuze: You’re going too fast; you’re going too fast.\n\nThe student: The things is that Swann plays alone when the real refuses to play. Or he plays in his own way perhaps. A lot of words like “aesthetics” or “reality” become pointless.\n\nDeleuze: Wait a minute… Why do you think that Swann at this level, why is Swann always presented as a dilettante and not as an artist? Swann isn’t Vinteuil or Vermeer – he’s a dilettante. A dilettante is someone who makes a territorializing use of aesthetics or art. He’s interested in it only insofar as it reminds him of something. On this point, you’re completely right – he’s in the territoriality of the Verdurins.\n\nBut even more so his love for Odette is seized by the Verdurins’ territoriality. What characterizes Swann’s aestheticism is that he still makes territorializing use of art. The little phrase – he makes a territorializing use of this phrase – ends up being bound to the perfume of the chrysanthemum… of a flower, so he makes a territorializing use of it between himself, Odette and this flower. So, from one end to the other, you’re completely right as far as this moment is concerned.\n\nBut then there’s another moment where we wouldn’t say the same thing. What happens in this second moment that Félix described, if I try to connect it to the first? A strange thing happens. For a million reasons beginning with the sorrow or whatever Proust describes at length. And here the line – in this case it happens to be the pictorial line – begins to flow. And it’s then that Swann begins…\n\nAnother student: Can you erase the rest of the blackboard?\n\nDeleuze: It’s not worth it. It has one advantage, it’s quite clear like that. It wouldn’t change anything if… And so… it’s at that very moment that Swann begins… not to become an artist, he will never be one, but to understand what an artist is.\n\nThe student: Which is to say?\n\nDeleuze: Which is to say that the musical line announces it, more and more. This other line, no longer pictorial but musical, will have a value in itself. It no longer depends on instruments. Instruments may embody it, but they don’t bring it into being… [Tape interrupted] [21:50]\n\nDeleuze: … It starts to flow of its own account, sine materia. Proust, who by the way rarely uses Latin, uses a Latin word here. If he uses a Latin word, it’s clear he’s deterritorializing himself. So it’s the instruments that depend on music and not the other way round. Painting begins to fall away; it’s not even painting anymore and the faces become deformed. There’s a deterritorialization of faces, a deterritorialization of the musical phrase. And also, a deterritorialization of the love for Odette, and this deterritorialization of the love for Odette will be expressed in the idea of Odette at the other end of the world… [Tape interrupted] [22:44]\n\nDeleuze: … The problem we posed from the beginning, whatever digressions may have occurred — though I would add that, today, they aren’t really digressions — the problem we’ve been dealing with from the very beginning is to try to understand how a particular type of power — the power of the face — is constituted and how it functions. For this reason, I found it opportune to briefly mention earlier how a society doesn’t just function through the cop’s truncheon. You have to be an idiot if you think that. It also functions through a cop’s face; it functions through the teacher’s face. Kids at grade school say: “Ooh, the teacher looked at me”.\n\nThe student: And what about the blackboard?\n\nDeleuze: Be quiet and let me finish. [Pause] The blackboard isn’t me. [Laughter] “The teacher, the teacher looked at me, she looked at me!” There’s a power in that. It’s not a matter of generating power from the face but of saying that the face or faciality is caught up in systems of power. We have to analyze it like — but no one’s forcing us, we could speak about something else if you like, fine — we have to analyze it as a cog in certain mechanisms of power… [Tape interrupted] [24:27]\n\n[During this break in filming, someone seems to have insisted that Deleuze respond rather than another student, to which Deleuze reacts with astonishment, although seemingly with good humor]\n\nDeleuze: [Noises of students around Deleuze] … Incredible. [Laughter] Incredible this reaction that consists in telling me that it’s my responsibility to answer when someone speaks. I don’t see why I should. Sibony, go ahead and speak, go ahead. Don’t let them treat you like that.\n\nDaniel Sibony: I don’t really see the problem. Actually, there is no problem. We’re trying to speak about how things really function, how they really work. Speaking about the face of the teacher, I have a feeling that this is really new!  This is speaking seriously about power, and power, that is, that functions really, how that, how that, when you are inside it, how we operate within it, how we are within it, how that works… [Tape interrupted] [25:18]\n\nSibony: I was speaking about the face of Giscard d’Estaing… Will you listen? Let me… either ask a fucking question or let me finish my sentence!\n\nAnother woman student [shouting at Sibony]: [Indistinct, repeated command]\n\nSibony: Let me finish! Please, let me finish, I won’t take long. I simply wanted to say that we can speak about the face or the voice of Giscard d’Estaing in a way that can be very useful, and it certainly doesn’t mean, I don’t know, being interested in what’s happening in the metro or what’s happening currently in prisoners in jails.\n\nAnother student: That’s a topic for practical class sessions, my friend.\n\nSibony: No… [The students make even more noise, preventing him from speaking]\n\nA woman student: Can’t you stand up so we can see your face? [Laughter and noise from students]\n\nAnother student: His face. [Tape interrupted] [25:58]\n\nDeleuze: … What Félix and I are proposing are things we have already written. We’re giving back to you our old tricks. I am saying this is defamatory [Deleuze laughs and sits down] … [Tape interrupted] [26:18]\n\nA student: The inspectors on the metro, the people in prison, the CGT [General Confederation of Labour] …\n\nDeleuze: These people don’t have faces in your view?\n\nThe first student: In a Fascist kind of way but one finds faces that are only visible … [indistinct words] And at Vincennes, compared to how it used to be, we just have pointless conversations. I don’t know why I came.\n\nOther students: [Indistinct comments]\n\nThe first student: Whether the conversations are pointless or not, compared to other conversations…\n\nAnother student: I mean, we’re all in the metro, we all take the metro.\n\nThe first student: Yes, but there, Vincennes in relation to what it was seems to me particularly hard to bear.\n\nAnother student: No, come on, listen, we’re fed up with this.\n\nDeleuze: No really what they are saying is good, for someone to say… sorry, you’ll speak in a minute…\n\nThe student: [He continues while blocking Deleuze, unclear words]\n\nDeleuze: If he says… in fact, if he says…\n\nA woman student: Why do we bother closing the door, we’re being watched all the time, by spies. Everybody’s spying through their face.\n\nAnother student: The problem is that the spies… [unclear words]\n\nAnother student: Everyone judges through faces…\n\nAnother student: It’s been two years that I’ve wanted to say that.\n\nAnother student: All that’s been said already, it’s stupid…\n\nStudents: [Different voices, unclear words]\n\nYolande Finkelstein: No, but I mean, for me, it’s the first time I’ve come to this class. I haven’t been coming for two years. I mean, I don’t know, what’s going on here?\n\nAnother student: We are coming here… [Unclear words]\n\nYolande Finkelstein: When I say “here” I mean… [Pause, voices] Anyhow, when Deleuze talks, he talks about certain things, and then suddenly, one day something happens and all hell breaks loose, about Power relations, stuff like that, another thing… what’s going on? So, there’s some individual thing which suddenly is about power relations, other stuff, vague, ambiguous stuff. So, how does that work as well? everyone functions as well…\n\nAnother student: Well, that is the question! … [Diverse voices, unclear words [Tape interrupted] [28:01]\n\nGuattari: … [What we’re trying to do here] is to dismantle things and to find tools and modes of orientation different from those of psychoanalysis or Marxist principles, with the result that we sometimes take certain liberties gabbing about Proust or whatever without having to censor ourselves like what goes on in the army. Maybe we’re even taking the shortest route. I’ve no idea. [Tape interrupted] [28:23]\n\nYolande Finkelstein [addressing the student who spoke about metros]: No, but I’d like to answer him…\n\nGuattari [speaking to the student who has mentioned the metros] You’re saying that that works, so let’s talk about it. I don’t think that it’s …\n\nYolande Finkelstein: But I want to say something to him… Considering what you were saying about the street, the metro, the prisons… there are some interesting things happening now. On the bus a few years ago, there used to be a driver and a ticket inspector at the back that you showed your ticket to. Now there’s just one person on the bus. And what does he do? He’s both driver and cop. And the other day I heard a driver say quite explicitly: “I have eyes everywhere. That’s why I’m here!” If you don’t show him your bus pass or whatever, he knows it, you see. In the same way that when you go to a store or supermarket, the cashiers and the salesperson don’t just sell you their merchandise, but they also know why you’re there, meaning whether you’re going to buy or shoplift.\n\nAnd in relation to this it seems to me, I don’t know, that in the Communist Party, for example… I’m probably talking shit, but I don’t really give a fuck about the PC… but it seems to me that in the places where we meet to talk, we don’t really talk, and that, for example, there don’t seem to be certain moments, in the bus or in the supermarket, or, fine… to deactivate these mechanisms. That’s extremely important. After all, what is it that we are living every day?\n\nDeleuze: For myself, I’d say that, actually, what we are living every day is…\n\nThe student [to whom Yolande was speaking]: You’re saying that it’s visible from one’s face?\n\nYolande Finkelstein: No, I’m not saying that it’s visible from someone’s face… [Pause, voices] I’m not saying it’s visible from someone’s face because when I walk into the supermarket, all the shopgirls are going to move in on me before I’ve taken anything at all! [30:00] [Huge laughter; Deleuze stands rubbing his face] [Tape interrupted] [30:08]\n\nDeleuze: … The faces of the cops are not just the ones behind their truncheons, they’re not just in the street. And there doesn’t even need to be a teacher. There is a presence. That’s why we use this word, faciality. It’s not metaphysics, so what is it? It serves to indicate that the face doesn’t need to be present in flesh and blood. The teacher can very well leave the school. There will still be something. A cog of power that doesn’t need to be embodied in actuality. So, we might wonder, does it function as a super-ego? A number of psychoanalysts would say it does. Or you too might think so… But what about us? We think that notions such as super-ego are completely worthless and that cogs of power don’t function in this way. So how do they function? And then, some people ask, where does all this lead to? It leads to a choice. To make them function or to make them dysfunctional. To analyze the power relations that are established in a room and not only these. We’ll have to wait until the next lesson which will be of an entirely different nature. All that, as they say, is politics… [Tape interrupted] [31:48]\n\nGeorges Comtesse: Considering what you say, what you think, what you think about Proust… in your view, what is it, at the moment of the face collapsing, of the rupture of the anchoring point that fixes it to the territory… what is it that in that moment, in that collapse, makes hatred arise?\n\nGuattari: Roughly speaking, it happens when the eyes go blind… [Tape interrupted] [32:23]\n\nGuattari: … At the last moment he tries to reconstruct Odette’s faciality, and all the facialities take off, with the business of the monocles, the nose that elongates, etc. At that moment, in this way, he knows he has to reconstruct something else, to recreate a world, and hatred arises out of the fact that he doesn’t have the talent to make lines of flight. [Tape interrupted] [32:46]\n\nEric Alliez [screaming much of what follows]: We are all in ideology! That’s the first point, as soon as we engage in culture! First of all, we have to consider the question we are posing. And here I’m going to quote a woman, the adolescent, Colette. Naturally… I’m quoting this stuff, the decors, the unrequited dreams, the castles in Bavaria. I’m talking about Colette, because what is Colette?\n\nComments off-camera, perhaps Deleuze: [Indistinct words]\n\nAlliez: No, no, no, no, no. I’m taking about that. Panaït Istrati, Kazantzakis. These three guys are not at all… neither left-wing nor… I don’t know what Colette was; nobody talks about Colette… and this guy there [Deleuze], he talks all the time! How you talk! [Laughter] I’ve had it up to here! [Noises of student voices reacting, Alliez’s words get lost momentarily] I’ve seen The Travelling Players. That’s what I’m talking about. It’s beautiful and open. But it’s true that everything is contaminated by the plague. There’s something that has to be said. At the height of fascism, in a musical or something, she started to say: “Long live happiness.” And I oppose Colette to Kafka… [Tape interrupted] [34:07]\n\nAlliez: Yesterday there was a writer on TV, Didier Decoin on Jacques Chancel’s show [Radio show, “Radioscopie” on France-Inter], who said “It’s marvellous being a priest and giving God orders”. So, the left, like Guattari, you want to give orders to God, to the party? What the fuck is that about? Are you priests? That’s not the problem, of course. [Pause]\n\nDiscussion off-camera, perhaps Deleuze: [Indistinct words]\n\nAlliez: You… you… the thing is…, it’s that, the thing is, it’s that… [Pause] Zorba, he dances confronting the fascism in Greece! What is that all about, eh? And not at the level of madness, the problem is elsewhere. [Pause]\n\nDiscussion off-camera, perhaps Deleuze: [Indistinct words]\n\nAlliez: It’s very important. I pose the question because everyone is… I don’t know what we should do… There are two solutions: suicide, which is the bungled act, and resistance, which is the obscure. And between the two, dance! There are no other situations worth speaking about. Because if we talk about the system, it’s the Fascists that get discussed… And Pasolini, according to some his films are brilliant, but for me something’s wrong. He’s in Christ. Opposing Christ to the Church is fantastic, it’s pure Dostoyevsky, it goes back to guilt and absolution… The revolt of [Indistinct name], the father of the Tzars, it must have been really hard for him! [Tape interrupted] [35:35]\n\nAlliez [screaming] … hey, will you let me…? The PC represents half the workers in France.\n\nA student [attempting to respond]: [Indistinct words, cut off]\n\nAlliez [screaming]: You, you’re not in touch with the workers!\n\nAnother student: What are you talking about?\n\nAlliez [screaming]: Absolutely not!\n\nFirst student: [Unclear words, perhaps]: So, I’m a conspirator.\n\nEric Alliez: No… [Tape interrupted] [35:49]\n\nAlliez: … I’m posing a question, the question of war. You, Deleuze, said that Freud got it wrong! He was in ideology and talked about the death drive of war. It’s backfiring on us! What is this shit? Today in France there’s a war psychosis. We don’t even know where the enemy is. Once it was China…\n\nA woman student: You’re just saying the same thing that they said. They were talking about [Voices block her words] and so on. If you had listened, maybe you would have… [Voices block her, everyone speaks at once]\n\nSound recordist: Did you film everything?\n\nMarielle Burkhalter: Yes!\n\nSound recordist: The sound isn’t great… [Pause; noises of students]\n\nDeleuze [Image of Deleuze standing with arms wrapped around himself]: There we are, let’s say … [Noises of students standing and leaving]\n\nMarielle Burkhalter: It wasn’t bad. [End of the session] [37:01]\n\n \n\n \n\n"

Purdue University Research Repository. doi:10.4231/Z7QY-RG08\n\n\n\n\nGilles Deleuze\n\nDeleuze & Guattari at Vincennes, 1975-76\n\nIl Senso in Meno, Part 3 – Faciality, Landscapity, Despotic Power\n\nTranslation: Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; transcription and time stamp, Charles J. Stivale\n\n[Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions]\n\nDeleuze: I’d like you to reflect on this… There’s the strike today, so there aren’t many of us here. Which is good. But how should we proceed? I would suggest that, apart from what you might want to propose… either you can speak about what we’ve done so far – if you have anything to add or go back to – or else, considering that the things I wanted to talk about today are not yet clear in my mind, I can recount them in a calmer, more relaxed fashion than last time… In this way, next time, I can begin again, and everything will be clearer… [Tape interrupted] [1:01]\n\nDeleuze: … Anything that might spring to mind… Think well. I have an idea… I have an idea but it doesn’t work, it’s no good. It doesn’t matter…\n\nA student: Can I ask you a question to clarify something?\n\nDeleuze: A question to clarify? Yes. Yes. I say yes with a certain melancholy because I always find it sad. So, some questions, yes… but not many. [Tape interrupted] [1:38]\n\nThe student: Is faciality something basic, and in a certain sense a more important point than the other two, or at a first level, are they all the same thing?\n\nDeleuze: It depends on the level… I’m sorry if I answer you this way, but obviously it depends on the level. At a certain level everything is seized by, and refers to, faciality, while at other levels faciality comes completely undone, and it’s these levels that naturally interest us the most. But it requires a lot of effort to arrive at the levels where faciality slips away in favour of a faceless being… and then problematizes the question of the rapport between faciality and animality — in fact it problematizes a lot of things…\n\nThe student: What about the role of music?\n\nDeleuze: Music? Yes, oh yes, oh yes. Here I plan to regroup a certain number of notions that encompass your question and that put into play somewhat a lot of what we will be covering this year because faciality comes undone as much to the advantage of what we’ve called becoming-animal as to that of musical lines. But isn’t there a rapport between becoming-animal and musical lines? As in the case of Mozart’s birds… What’s do we mean by Mozart’s birds? It doesn’t mean that Mozart makes the little birds sing. It means that his music, in a certain manner, has a rapport with birds that aren’t actually birds. So what are they? What is the relationship between becoming-music and becoming-animal?\n\nThe student: It’s the exact opposite of Wagner’s music, the moment in the forest.\n\nDeleuze: Is it the opposite? Regarding the problem of music – it’s a good moment to speak about this now – the rapport between musical forms and things that can be defined neither as subjects nor themes but which are actual becomings… The becoming-child in music, the little refrain…\n\nThink of an extraordinary case, a real genius, one of the greatest composers who ever lived: Schumann. His modes, his forms of musical expression are radically new, and are caught up in a series of child becomings with blocs of childhood. The story of Schumann is a good pretext for biographical-aesthetic assemblages. It’s no small matter, the becoming-animal of Schumann. When he dies, having gone mad, he has a rapport with animals that is… he hears notes only as animals. But these aren’t real animals… he doesn’t hear lions… he doesn’t hear… These are Schumann’s lions, Schumann’s hyenas… [On Schumann and blocks, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 298-304, and on Mozart’s birds, pp. 304-305; on Schumann and the refrain, see pp. 347-350] [Tape interrupted] [4:56]\n\nDeleuze: While Mozart’s birds are the most spiritual birds in the world. There’s no contradiction between becoming-animal and becoming-spiritual. There’s no opposition. What’s more…\n\nA student [trying to interrupt Deleuze who just continues]: … there’s a difference between becoming-spiritual and … [words lost due to Deleuze speaking]\n\nDeleuze: … What’s more, at the end of ascesis, you are, you haven’t yet become, but you are within the becoming-animal. The great ascetics of Syria actually grazed…\n\nA student: I had pointed out… [words blocked as Deleuze continues]\n\nDeleuze: … in their struggle against the Church… when they said the Church is taking a wrong path, and they were hoping to return to the desert. You know how the ascetics lived on their columns, well when they came down, they grazed like cows. What we have here is a becoming-animal caught up in a becoming-ascetic, which is really fascinating, fascinating… [Deleuze and Guattari briefly mention the “grazing anchorite” in a list of becomings, A Thousand Plateaus, p. 247] [Tape interrupted] [5:52]\n\nDeleuze: … Roughly speaking, we see how animal, spirit, man, woman, child are distinguishable as terms at the level of becomings. The becoming-animal, the becoming-spiritual, the becoming-child, the becoming-woman, the becoming-man, the becoming-woman of man, the becoming-man of woman and so on. All this is caught up in a kind of line that is an abstract machine, a sort of abstract line. But I’m saying too much, we haven’t even started yet… [Tape interrupted] [6:30]\n\nDeleuze: Shall we proceed? Any questions on the previous topics? They’re not really precise yet so let’s try to move on a bit… [Tape interrupted] [6:41]\n\nDeleuze: … Both in Lacan and Sartre, though in two completely different ways, the question of faces and gazes is situated – and I would add extremely actively so – in function of a certain position and a certain problem of subjectivity. I would almost say that our desire would be to do the opposite. And that should we discover processes of subjectivation, these must be in function of the face, rather than the face being related to functions of the subject. In Sartre it’s self-evident, the whole theory of the gaze is at the service of the Sartrean conception of the cogito.\n\nIn Lacan, if you go back to his essay on the Mirror Stage… broadly speaking I would say that the Mirror Stage seems to me to imply – and here I’m expressing myself in a very crude, rudimentary way – a kind of capture of the image which encloses it, so that in the end it is placed in relation to the so-called symbolic order, or what Lacan refers to as the symbolic order, and to a split subject in the symbolic order.\n\nWhy is it that we… when Guattari spoke the other time about faciality, are faced with a different problem? It’s because what we are mainly interested in are the relations between faciality and power and not the relations of the face and the gaze to a subject, however it might be conceived.\n\nWhat do we mean by face-power relations? I will speak of the role and function of the face in power apparatuses. I’m improvising slightly but we can agree that power apparatuses are not reducible to a unified entity. Political power is the face of the leader. I don’t know if this is the case now for Georges Marchais, but at the time of Thorez, when Thorez arrived at a party meeting  people would say, “Ah, here’s Maurice!” The first name is indicative of a face. “Look, it’s Maurice, hello Maurice!” So political power is the face of the boss.\n\nAnd suddenly it’s no longer only the first name. There’s the whole role of the poster, the portrait. The portrait has its own history: painting. And painting is complicit with power apparatuses, even if it is so in its own way, as for example in the case of Goya or Velasquez… [Tape interrupted] [10:22]\n\nDeleuze: … One of the functions of painting itself is to establish the official portrait. The portrait of the king, the portrait of the leader… or today it’s photography. Can we get shut of all this, by saying that they are simply ideological phenomena? Perhaps we will have the chance to see how bad a concept ideology is, not because it defines phenomena of illusion but because the concept of ideology itself is a completely false one. Ideology doesn’t exist. What exist are components in power organizations.  Thus, the face of the leader, political faciality, is perhaps a component of the political power apparatus.\n\nSecond example, I continue… passional power. If there is a political power, there is equally a power of the passions. It’s a classic theme. Passional power and the face of the beloved. When did this happen? It’s not a simple matter… It occurred when the face of the beloved took on the appearance of a piece in a power apparatus. The passion-power. When did this occur? Broadly speaking – perhaps there are precedents – this happens during the time of courtly love. It’s then that the face of the beloved takes on a role – it begins around the 11th-13th century – that compared with previous epochs really seems like a bout of madness. We can say that something new made its appearance. So, this is my second example: passional power – and with it a second form of faciality: the face of the beloved… [Tape interrupted] [12:44]\n\nThen there is a topic that has become a commonplace of psychology, of neonatal psychology, which is the baby’s reaction to the mother’s face. It’s interesting… they don’t talk about the reaction to the gaze, it’s always the question of the maternal face. The baby that is being breastfed reacts to mummy’s face. The power of family is the mother’s face. So, there we have a third form, or a third case, of faciality. One expert on this question is a paediatrist and psychoanalyst called Spitz. S-P-I-T-Z. He has shown the importance of a certain illness that he regards as quintessential in the development of a number of schizophrenic phenomena in children. The baby, when deprived of the mother’s face, reacts through a strange malady characterized by schizoid disorders.\n\nThen we have the face of the “star”. The star’s face is interesting. For the next time – seeing as how there aren’t many of you at today’s class and we’re limiting ourselves to sketching out some new topics… The star’s face… we’d need someone familiar with the history of cinema to do some research on this topic which must be really interesting… What role did the star’s face play in silent cinema? And with the advent of the talkies, did anything change in the function of faciality at the level of the star’s face? Did the voice really have the role that’s been attributed to it at the beginning of the talkies? It certainly did have a role but not the one you might think. When the talkies began, did the individuation of the star occur through voice or not?\n\nA student: There are examples of stars who made the transition from silent to sound cinema…\n\nDeleuze: Yes, although there aren’t many for whom it worked. But I’m thinking more of the question: silent star, sound star. Does the faciality function work in the same way?… [Tape interrupted] [15:52]\n\nYolande Finkelstein: All of discourse, the whole of literature is situated in relation to the desire of the other. And the other’s desire means the other’s gaze. Which means that suddenly the only things that can exist do so through the other’s gaze. And what I wanted to talk about in the last lesson in relation to a certain type of spectacle… I suddenly have the impression that, in the same way that money circulates, so too do gazes. I mean… at the level of merchandise, how desire is imprinted… and besides… you were talking about the boss’s face… well, I want to speak about woman’s face. Because woman’s face doesn’t exist either, and…\n\nDeleuze: Sorry, I did make an allusion to courtly love and the face of the beloved.\n\nYolande Finkelstein: Yes, ok, but I mean even woman, even speaking about ‘woman’ in general. I mean, in the spectacle there is always a certain division of roles, of functions. And seeing as how the other day we were speaking about the semiotic wall, to be honest now I’d like to speak about doors. I mean… there’s always a kind of unfolding of events that takes the form of a trial, and therefore you have a whole category of illusory doors. And… well, anyway, that’s it.\n\nDeleuze: Yes? Yes? What you are calling, perhaps it is relatively close, if these are illusory doors, they are perhaps quite close to what Félix was calling black holes. There could be a connection there. But we’ll see. But I think that goes entirely in the direction of… – [An abrupt sound of movement] Don’t fall down! – That goes entirely in the direction of… [Deleuze does not finish the sentence]\n\nYes, so let’s suppose that these functions of faciality, these facialities pertain to apparatuses of power, and are distributed throughout them with different functions. And maybe even through different figures. Let’s chance a small verbal link with some previous matters. Wouldn’t the face be one of their key forms? But of what, you may ask. One of the key forms of redundancy… or, better, isn’t the face a knot of arborescence? And to enter into rhizomes, don’t we have to undo the face? And what would it mean, “to undo the face”? Well, it’s just a question, a point of reference that will maybe help us locate things… but let’s be more precise.\n\nLet’s suppose that power needs, or rather powers need – each in their own way – to produce face. There is a production of face. In the story of how Hitler… and here Félix was right in speaking in general about micropolitics… when we think of the story of how Hitler came to power: why should it be Hitler and not the high command who was ready to seize power? Why Hitler? What took place at the micropolitical level? There were traits of faciality that provoked redundancy, a resonance that had political and economic dimensions. This is why we’re well beyond simple ideology. What was it that made Hitler’s face literally rewarding, not illusory, not ideological, but profitable and rewarding? There is an economy of faciality.\n\nLet’s try to formulate this… For the moment all we have is a rough schema, I’m not saying we have an answer. But let’s try to advance with this topic. Where does the link between power and faciality derive from? Once again, we can’t say that faciality is at the source of power. That would be a nonsense, to ascribe everything to psychology or I don’t know what. Faciality has its place, as a component piece of power apparatuses.\n\nSo then, where does the link derive from? For sure, there is no genetic link. Again, we cannot say that power derives from a face that imposes itself. That’s not it. So where does this intimate rapport faciality-power apparatus originate? We can conceive of systems where it doesn’t feature. Let’s imagine… let’s proceed by an imaginative experiment, which is the best way because it’s always there that we can vary things. There are different semiotics, the face is obviously part of a type of semiotics. The face, faciality, is a semiotics of power or it forms part of certain semiotics of power.\n\nBut there are other semiotics that don’t function through faciality. The mask… the mask is a very complicated notion. We have to think about masks the way Levi-Strauss considered totemism, which is to say that the mask as such is a false concept. Masks have such a multiplicity of functions that speaking about the mask doesn’t mean anything. But there are cases where the mask, rather than constituting a phenomenon of faciality, constitutes a phenomenon whose role is to make the head into an actual function of the body – which is to say, its role is to avert all risk of an autonomous faciality. This helps us advance a little…\n\nIn other semiotics of power, in other systems, there needs to be autonomy of faciality but to whose benefit, and for what? Sorry, we’re going too fast here… Every time a semiotics of power will have the tendency to deny or suppress references of corporeality, coordinates of corporeality, it will at the same time tend to replace the semiotics of corporeality with a semiotics of a wholly different nature: that of faciality.\n\nLet’s take the example of what we could call, just to be simple, primitive peoples… or rather – to use a more useful word that will help us lose the evolutionist baggage – we can even talk about pre-signifying semiotics, primitive semiotics. [On this point, see in A Thousand Plateaus the two plateaus, on signifying regimes and on faciality] What goes on in primitive semiotics? All the components are interwoven in such a way that they never find themselves dominated by a signifier. That’s why we can refer to them as pre-signifying – semiotics that aren’t distributed in line with signifying chains, but which refer simultaneously to gestural, rhythmic and oral components – which doesn’t mean components of the face… by oral components I mean the mouth as a cavity, and that has nothing to do with the face.\n\nIf I seek to characterize these pre-signifying components, to attribute certain features to them, I would say: corporeality – including in their power apparatuses… So, corporeality, animality, an intimate rapport with animal-becomings, collective enunciation, a collective mode of enunciating… At the same time these semiotics are heavily territorialized, these power apparatuses are heavily territorialized. So, to sum up pell-mell: corporeality, animality, collectivity, territorialization… [Tape interrupted] [25:43]\n\nDeleuze: … We reterritorialize on the face, the face of the leader. “Hi Maurice, Maurice, you’re here!” “Hello Georges!” And Maurice, having nothing more to say, replies “Good morning comrade.” And there are murmurs of “Here’s the boss!” “Did you see? It’s the boss.” Then you have the face of the star. It’s Greta Garbo… “Hello Greta Garbo!” We’re light years away from questions of the gaze, with her dark glasses, the black holes of Greta Garbo. So, we have Greta Garbo. And then, “Oh, it’s mummy!”\n\nSo, anyway, this is our hypothesis. Unlike what occurs in semiotics of corporeality, or in corporeal power apparatuses of the primitive, pre-signifying type, faciality becomes, or would become – other than this we can’t say anything yet, we don’t know why… But faciality would perhaps become – it’s just a hypothesis – a key element of power apparatuses, when power apparatuses become disembodied, abstract, when they are deterritorialized, and therefore what happens is a reterritorialization on the face. What would this hypothesis mean? Maybe we’ll realize it’s false, but I’d be surprised… it’s not possible. We’ll realize that it is true but for reasons we don’t yet know. It’s clearly true; it cannot be false.\n\nSo where does this lead us? It leads us to say something quite simple, which is… when primitive codes break down, when they collapse, when pre-signifying codes – with their polyvocality, their mixture of gestural, rhythmic, corporeal, animal, territorialized components – when this collapse occurs… in brief, when the savages disappear to the profit of the great empires or whatever, you name it… feudality, certain forms of feudality — African, Asian — and later capitalism and so on… what happens is that sexuality, or even phenomena of  desire in general, undergo (if we want to continue with this terminology) a vast decoding. They are literally decoded. Their codes lay in pre-signifying semiotics. Women, the collective character of marriages, children… it was all in place, well framed. Obviously, there was a decoding of desire, of sexuality, women, children. Decoded flows of women, children. Our hypothesis consists simply in saying: faciality is what rises up as a means of overcoding. It’s not by chance that the face, unless it’s swollen, right, unless it’s swollen, is the least sexualized component of the body. And is the face part of the body? Yes, no… we don’t know… we shall see.\n\nIn any case, when primitive codes collapse, when desire undergoes this trial of decoding, it becomes overcoded by the face, which therefore takes on a function that is not at all that of sublimation – it won’t be directly sexual – but which will nonetheless form a part, an integral part, of sexuality. On a formal plane, the face will become the overcoding of sexuality. It becomes our way of overcoding sexuality, in line with the will and the directives of incorporeal, deterritorialized apparatuses of power and so on… It’s the face, the eyes of your beloved, your leader’s gaze. All these faces… the face of a star…\n\nGeorges Comtesse: The eyes of Elsa… [Reference to a collection of poems (1942) by Louis Aragon, as well as the name of his wife]\n\nDeleuze: The eyes of Elsa. Yes.  The eyes of Elsa…\n\nYolande Finkelstein: Even if…\n\nDeleuze [responding to an inaudible comment]: It’s not the same? It’s even another case? Fine… [Inaudible response] You’d better not mess around with the eyes of Elsa!\n\nA student: But he messed with them!\n\nYolande Finkelstein: But even if we take all these examples…\n\nDeleuze: And what happened then? What happened?\n\nYolande Finkelstein: But even if we take all these examples… there’s something I want to say… The other day, after the little accident, I heard someone say, well yes, but the guy who got into that fight, he spent the whole night with the woman he was with, next to whom he was standing…\n\nDeleuze: Great. That means it was a good subject. It’s clear that all these problems concern us, problems of the couple, of faciality, these concern us. Except for those holy spirits who have set off on a becoming-animal that consists in grazing. But I am the only one here…  actually, I shouldn’t have said that… Okay, so this is our first hypothesis. Is it clear to everyone? There aren’t any… [Tape interrupted] [33:03]\n\nA student: … I was very uneasy at the beginning, when you started talking about power. I would prefer if we just continued what we were doing… and when the subject came up, we could discuss it directly… but not to begin with it, because, I don’t know, the concept of power in this lesson has become too structured, so it’s… anyway…\n\nDeleuze: Just now, you mean?\n\nThe student: Yes, now we were speaking…\n\nDeleuze: So, we’ll stop.\n\nThe student: I hope so, but…\n\nDeleuze: Oh, we can’t talk about Proust all the time! [Laughter] And when we do talk about Proust, we’re discussing [unclear words] …\n\nThe student: But I have the impression that this matter… before the symbolic structuring Lacan speaks of, for example, you have aspects that connect to musculature, parasitism, the rapport with the mother… something that also reminds me a bit of a text by Marx on what a number of economists including Rousseau were saying about the state of humanity before capitalist society. I mean, what Marx calls the Robinsonades. When we speak about rhizomes or non-faciality or making faciality collapse, aren’t we perhaps falling into an idealist, even ideological discourse? And wanting to unmask something, falling into another schematization?\n\nDeleuze: You’re bringing up a lot of different questions here. Obviously, I am wary of any confrontation with psychoanalytical topics such as narcissism, pre-narcissism, Lacan’s topics in “The Mirror Stage”… I’m wary of them simply because they are none of our business. There’s room for a lot of kinds of business in the heavenly kingdom! Maybe we’ll come across what you’re saying. We’ll encounter it, but indirectly. I don’t know. Perhaps.\n\nWhen you say that it’s unnecessary to focus all our attention on power, grant me that we’ve only been discussing this for fifteen or twenty minutes, based on a single question. If you agree and no one has anything further to add, we’ll go back to this question, alas, we’ll go back to it because we need to; for Félix and I, it’s necessary. We’re trying to settle the issue, and it extends from the power of the star to that of Hitler, so it’s sufficiently varied, it’s quite varied — not to mention Odette’s power over Swann – the question is extremely varied. But for the moment we’re blocked. However we’ve established one thing, a hypothesis that I’ve tried to summarize… Yes?\n\nAnne Querrien: The first congregation of teachers that was deterritorialized and that attained a national scale was that of Jean Baptiste de La Salle. Curiously enough The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, which teaches correct comportment, and was written by de La Salle… millions of copies of which were distributed in France… is the first to say something positive about the face.\n\nDeleuze: Interesting… What date is that?\n\nAnne Querrien: The first edition is from 1713… and in the previous Rules – which is closer to de La Salle in terms of content – the only mention of the face is this: “Since it is upon the face that signs of the spirit of wisdom and modesty especially appear, which cause one to be well or favourably judged, we must ensure that it is always well composed” … [Tape interrupted] [37:15]\n\nAQ: … “To be agreeable to others, do not assume a stern or a forbidding countenance…”\n\nDeleuze: You all hear that, right? [Laughter]\n\nAQ: “It should not be stern or forbidding but nor should it show anything too giddy or resembling a schoolboy. The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom. Nor is it according to decorum to have a melancholy or a peevish countenance, and your face ought never to reflect any passion or ill-regulated affection. Your face ought to be happy with no sign of…”\n\nDeleuze: I interrupt you, Anne, just to stress one of Félix’s concepts – which is the enumeration of traits of faciality and their associated norms with respect to a model-face.\n\nAnne Querrien: And it continues… “with no sign of either intemperance or dissipation. It ought to be serene but not too easygoing; open, without giving signs of too great a familiarity; gentle, without softness, and never suggesting anything vulgar. To everyone it must manifest your respect or, at the least, your affection and goodwill. It is, however, proper to allow the expression on your face to reflect the various business matters and circumstances that arise.”\n\nAnd then he goes on to explain that on a sad occasion, one must not obviously appear cheerful [Laugther] The wise man seeks to “maintain a tranquil countenance that does not readily change its disposition or expression, no matter what happens, agreeable or disagreeable… It is something very improper, something that shows great vanity and is not at all becoming in a Christian, to apply beauty spots and paint to your face, covering it with powder and rouge. The vain person who resorts to such artifices performs an unnatural gesture since nature is our reference.”\n\nDeleuze: Obviously classical, not romantic nature…\n\nAnne Querrien: Yes, classical. It also says that one shouldn’t frown as a furrowed brow expresses melancholy. [Laughter] “It is impolite to knit your eyebrows; this is a sign of haughtiness. Instead, you ought to keep your brows relaxed all the time… To raise them indicates scorn, and to let them droop over the eyes is characteristic of the melancholy person”. The part about the eyes is also very interesting. The rules of modesty insist that the eyes should be soft, serene, demure, etc.\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that all this is contained in The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility which was distributed to the entire population and then taken up by teachers… “Modesty being the only external quality that can be controlled”, which is to say modesty is what keeps body and face as they should be. Every two months, the friars of Christian schools had to write a letter to their superior recounting everything they had done – meaning if they had been modest, well-behaved, if they had been ill, if they’d had evil thoughts and also how they’d behaved towards the children. It was a literary system created to account for one’s own behaviour by the master friars of the Christian Schools.\n\nDeleuze: Not, literary but a programmatic system…\n\nAnne Querrien: Yes, yes,\n\nDeleuze: There was a program of the face, a program of faciality.\n\nAnne Querrien: Also… with respect to landscape, to landscapity… the Jesuits speak about this. In ascesis, in the spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the first phase is the composition of a place: meaning that one always has to be represented in a place or landscape. There is a series of key landscapes, I have to look for the reference, because I just discovered about this… He ordered a collection of engravings, placing himself in landscapes where Christ had apparently lived. And this is how he began his spiritual exercises.\n\nDeleuze: In the landscape?\n\nAnne Querrien: For the Jesuits, it was in the landscape…\n\nDeleuze: So, in the Jesuit order the exercises…\n\nAnne Querrien: Historically speaking this is a century before…\n\nDeleuze: … the landscapity of the Jesuits, and the faciality of the scholars who followed, who take up the Jesuits’ methods… but in order to invent something specific of their own.\n\nAnne Querrien: More specifically for the people.\n\nA student: What you’ve just read… in 1946, in a Catholic school in Gerson where I studied… I was fourteen… somebody read that to me. I haven’t heard it since then. And they pointed out what you just said. I mean, I was at boarding school and in our classroom, we had images of Saint Ignatius of Loyola… this was 1946.\n\nDeleuze: Images of landscapity, landscapes. But In Loyola’s writings, as far as you know… was the landscape already presented as something that had to convey certain sentiments of the soul that could be expressed on the face, right?\n\nAnne Querrien: On the face ? [Unclear words] … I haven’t researched it, so I don’t know.\n\nDeleuze: Perhaps it only passed by way of the soul’s sentiments… Yes?\n\nRobert Albouker: In one of his seminars, Foucault was speaking about confession during the classical age, and he spent the entire hour talking about how confession worked with the Jesuits.\n\nDeleuze: Yes, he takes it up in Discipline and Punish.\n\nRobert Albouker: Confession has to be carried out point-by-point for the whole body and especially in relation to the eyes and what one hears. Half of confession concerns the face… What did you see, what did you hear, what did you smell? You have to tell them everything.\n\nThe previous student: I want to say something else – excuse me — regarding confession that left its marks; all this reminds me of it. I was on the steps of the Gerson staircase in Rue de la Pompe, before my confession, with my confessor nearby – I had a master-confessor –, I was looking at an issue of Cinémonde with a photo of Martine Carol, half-naked, and that I hadn’t even had time to sneak a look at, [Laughter] and I was looking inside at the section on films, and my confessor came and told me: “Don’t spread [diffuser] that image around!” Those were his exact worlds, “Don’t spread this image around!”\n\nDeleuze: “Don’t spread that image around!” That’s very important, and we’ll see why. Remember these words! “Don’t spread that image around!” Note them down; [Laughter] We’ll need that… “Don’t pass this image around!” Note it down… Ah yes, otherwise, I won’t remember it. [Regarding De la Salle and Loyola, both raised in this discussion, Deleuze will indeed recall this as he and Guattari refer to both pedagogical principles in A Thousand Plateaus, p. 533, note 7]\n\nAnne Querrien: Concerning the landscape…\n\nDeleuze: Yes?\n\nAnne Querrien: I want to go back to the text…\n\nDeleuze: It’s important this sequence: landscapity-faciality, obviously.\n\nAnne Querrien: According to the book I read, which is unfortunately just an abridged popular edition…\n\nDeleuze: It’s a what?\n\nAQ: An abridged edition; it’s part of the Seuil editions, the Spiritual Masters series, I believe. In any case, the Loyola citation I mentioned says that it really aims at creating a deliberate case of redundancy. That is, it’s a question of inscribing…\n\nDeleuze: Really, does it say that?\n\nAnne Querrien: Yes, well, not exactly like that, if you will, but it says that it is a question of inscribing the imagination within such limits…\n\nDeleuze: You’re a fraudster, like us! [Laughter]\n\nAnne Querrien [laughing as well]: More or less… [Pause] It’s a question of inscribing the imagination within strict limits, in such a way that it becomes completely fixated on the desired object, thereby yielding something similar.\n\nDeleuze: It is redundancy, redundancy of frequency because I’m sure they carried it out several times a day. That works for us, perfect, perfect… [Tape interrupted] [44:20]\n\nDeleuze: Yes, did you want to say something?\n\nYolande Finkelstein: Yes because, a while ago, people thought about setting Jacques Martin straight because he hosts a TV show every Sunday morning called “Le petit rapporteur”… and every week his aim is to demolish a figure on the left. And his main argument is “Did you see that guy’s face?” Really…\n\nDeleuze: Yeh, yeh…\n\nYF: “Did you see that guy’s face?”\n\nA woman student: [Inaudible remarks, but apparently regarding actions by Sartre]\n\nDeleuze: Unfortunately, Martin did something like that, but we have to forgive Sartre everything. [Laughter] I think he explained himself later. He said he had been rushed; he’d spoken too quickly. At least I think that Sartre said something like that. [Pause]\n\nSo… ok fine. We’re done with this first point. I’ll pass on now to a second point that at first glance seems completely different… I haven’t forgotten, Antoine, we can talk later if you don’t mind… [Tape interrupted] [45:32]\n\nDeleuze: … I would just like to have the right to dream a little, with Félix and all of you. I say the words, “There it is, I see!” And it’s as if – and it’s not by chance that I’m saying this, because it’ll be useful later – it’s as if we pretended to fall asleep. As if we were in the phase of falling asleep, as psychologists say. And then we start to see strange things.\n\nThe first thing I see, and I really do see it, I’m seeing it… is the face of the despot. The despot’s face is highly significant. I would even say that in this first figure we have the very substance of the signifier. He has knitted his eyebrows; he has a hidden smile. The despot’s face as signifier, you can find texts everywhere, on all the despots, where they talk about their facial tics, they had their… [Deleuze does not complete the sentence] [On the despotic face as signifier, see A Thousand Plateaus, plateau 5 on regimes of signs, notably pp. 130-137, and plateau 7 on faciality, notably pp. 180-184]\n\nThis face of the despot… allows me to dream, maybe I’m mistaken, we don’t know yet. It’s a face that imposes itself upon us, at least when we are falling asleep, and it’s always facing me. A frontal face. You could say to me “And what about yours?”  Well, I don’t have that. I tend to be bowed over, though I obviously look at that face, sometimes bowed over, sometimes with my eyes raised. It’s a face on high. Facing me.\n\nSo why this face? There must be a reason. Because for all of us… it doesn’t matter if you realize it or not, you’ll always see it as you’re falling asleep… Why is this face, facing us, projected on a white wall? As though the wall had windows. It’s similar to the techniques of graffiti. A man facing us on a white wall, on a white background. The white wall and the signifying face seen frontally. Like the face on the Shroud. The face imprinted on a handkerchief. This face facing us on a white wall seems to me something terrifying, something terrifying. While we’re in peaceful conditions for falling asleep, it’s terrifying. Maybe it doesn’t exist, maybe it does, maybe…\n\nAnyway, there’s a first point, let’s put it aside for the moment. It already forms a schema. A white rectangle, a face. Is this face already a black hole? A black hole on a white wall, that would suit us. But let’s not rush things. Let’s just say: a face on a white wall. And that’s the face signed and frontal. That’s the signifying despotic face. In fact, it doesn’t act by means of the signified. It acts through a series of rhythmic lines on a white wall. What it means, which is to say what it signifies… is of no importance. Whatever it signifies, it will always signify something, and this something will never be any use to us. It’s pointless to concern ourselves with it.\n\nSecond figure… I’ve already developed this sufficiently so I can just remind you of it. Two faces facing each other… that approach one another as they descend. The first figure was, as we would say today in specialist language, synchronic. It’s synchronic: face on white wall. The second figure: two faces facing one another that move closer, following a line. As I said, I’ve already developed this at length, so I’m not going to insist: Tristan-Isolde, Tristan-Isolde, Tristan-Isolde up to an exaggerated proximity of the two faces – which means what? The plunge into the black hole.\n\nThis figure is diachronic. There’s a whole becoming of the two faces, which are not necessarily facing each other.  They might even be back-to-back. In any case, they are in profile, two faces in profile that descend, approach one another, brush against a black hole… faces that will plummet into a black hole, the black hole of passion. Tristan and Isolde. This time it’s no longer the signifying synchronic face of the despot on the white wall. It’s the passional face. Or, to stick to a convenient term, one without the slightest hint of evolutionism, it’s the “post-signifying” face. The passional face of the beloved, not with the function of signifiance, but with one that we could call the function of subjectivation.\n\nBut you see, following our method, this doesn’t mean that we refer the face to a subject but, rather, it is from a figure of the face that we generate the function of subjectivation. And when I refer to the two profiles that don’t necessarily face one another, in this diachrony, in this falling towards the black hole, this time, what we have is no longer a face seen frontally on a white wall but a face in profile that flows along a diachronic line, a diachronic line, in opposition to the surface of the white wall, that moves towards the black hole.\n\nBut not necessarily; I’m saying they are not necessarily looking at one another, as I said before. They might half turn to observe each other. You see, from passional love they’re already tending towards a kind of conjugal phase. They observe each other. Or else they turn away. God turns away from my face as I turn away from his. There was a time that gods didn’t turn their faces away. Which god invented the turning away of the face? Who was the god that turned his face away from his devotee, just as the devotee turned his face away from his god? Who invented this diachronic line that heads towards a black hole? It’s the history of the Jewish people, the story of the double turning away. A history that will have its own unfolding and that will end with the antisemite Heidegger… in his reinterpretation of the double turning away, that he calls categorical, and it’s not by chance that all this comes from Kant, passing by way of Hölderlin.\n\nThis falling asleep is opening up a lot of material, it’s becoming too erudite, so I’ll stop there, but it’s clear that here we have another figure… [Tape interrupted] [55:00]\n\nDeleuze: … You can see that our strongest desire is to make the black holes and the white walls function together. Because they have to. And this is where terror is born. A black hole in a white wall, there’s nothing more terrifying. Any other kind of death would be preferable to that.\n\nOkay, so here’s the third image we see while falling asleep. The previous ones were modes of organizing the traits of faciality. And as Anne quite rightly said, there is a list of traits of faciality that will be overcoded by the face.\n\nThe third figure of falling asleep that I see… and here things start to get more disturbing… what happens is a kind of freeing up of the traits of faciality that escape the face, as though the face melted and the traits of faciality became like birds, sometimes heavy, sometimes light… and began to interact with other traits, traits of landscapity… “Hair in the wind”, as Félix calls it.

Purdue University Research Repository. doi:10.4231/N04Q-JV46\n\n\n\n\nGilles Deleuze\n\nDeleuze & Guattari at Vincennes, 1975-76\n\nIl Senso in Meno, Part 4 – The Novel and Courtly Romance, the White Wall Black Hole of Passional Faciality, Demonism of the Negus, Art Brut, Henry Miller, Quanta of Information and Quanta of Possibilities\n\nTranslated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni\n\n \n\nDeleuze: … We had to find a way to break through the white wall or – which amounts to the same thing – to get out of the black hole. It’s not easy knowing how to get out of the black hole or how to break through the white wall. So here is a second grouping, not even of notions in this case but of dreams, of fallings asleep. \n\nAnd to conclude this second part, before I let you speak and tell me what you think, I would just like to say… There’s a strange story, a text that I think is wonderful. Here I open a parenthesis, but one that is inherent to the second notion. I number them so things will be clearer when we go back to them.  \n\nI know I seem to be going off the subject, but when people speak about the novel, or the history of the novel, there’s something that isn’t right. Because we’re so horrified by origins, by the return to origins, we’ve got into the habit of beginning from the end. Initially, this was a good thing, when the method worked, but then… We employ the rhizomatic method, which is different, we examine things from the middle. That way, we’re at no risk of making a mistake. This is the Kafka method, or the ant method. The rhizome method. An ant seizes things from the middle. We are ants. \n\nI was talking about the novel and how we had the habit of beginning from the end. We discover, for example, and here I make a concrete example… we experience the end of the novel, or we have experienced it, through a catastrophic text like Camus’s The Stranger. Or other marvellous novels, like those of Beckett that mark its limit point. The novel is over. Or else we’re told… that in a certain epoch there was the chivalric novel. And then that came to an end with the famous Don Quixote. Don Quixote marked the end of the romances of Chivalry because it’s the moment when there is no longer any sense in the figure of the knight, and he can only be embodied by someone like Don Quixote who is completely mad, mistaking windmills for who knows what and so on… It’s a well-known story. Don Quixote is considered the end of the chivalric novel. [On the chivalric novel in this context, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 173-174]\n\nA student: The horse is no longer a horse.\n\nDeleuze: What?\n\nThe student: Above all, the horse is no longer just a horse.\n\nDeleuze: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, it becomes more important. And these endings, to what do we attribute them? They are attributed when, and here again I roughly sum up, we are shown the hero to be a poor guy who is completely lost. What I’m saying is: of course there is an evolution of the novel – I’m not saying the novel has always remained the same – but if there is such an evolution then this is certainly not what it focuses on. Because the appearance of a character who is completely… I can’t think of a better term… completely lost, who doesn’t know what he’s doing, who doesn’t know his own name even, who is a stranger to everything, who is completely deterritorialized, who wanders along his line of flight understanding nothing, who stops, and when he’s not on his line of flight becomes completely catatonic, you see here what psychiatry defines as catatonic, a person who remains for hours on end in a movement that can be quite intricate, involving all the muscles, and who spends maybe 6 hours, 24 hours in this state. So then…\n\nA student: Are many of these people around?\n\nDeleuze: Not many of them are around, unfortunately, because the psychiatric hospitals were demolished, but at the time when there were psychiatric hospitals, you could see a lot of them about. You could see a lot of them! [Laughter, unclear for what reason] Whereas now, you see people lying on couches, [Laughter] in comparison, the catatonics were much more active. So anyway…\n\nThe student: But some of the shrinks fucking their patients!\n\nDeleuze: Catatonics?\n\nThe student: No.\n\nDeleuze: Ah… the others! It’s possible. Though the idea disturbs me… So, I was saying. This was the inauguration of the novel. This is it. If I have to define the novel, I’d say that it appears at the moment a certain type of character emerges. And if someone said to me, “but your definition of the novel is based on characters, that’s not the way to proceed, it’s the signifier that counts”, that just makes me laugh. The novel appears with a certain type of character who has no idea of his own name, of what he is doing, who is a complete idiot, utterly lost, completely just standing there and looking. And what is he looking at? He doesn’t even know. Someone comes up and taps him on the shoulder. \n\nI’d say that the real Albert Camus is Chrétien de Troyes. He’s the first great novelist. And the line runs from Chrétien de Troyes to Beckett who, it should be said, knows the Middle Ages well, all the Celtic novels and the romances of courtly love. And what do we find when we open a courtly romance? A romance of the courtly love cycles, or of Chrétien de Troyes. I’m not even going to read a passage because it would be too long, and you can find them in paperback editions. If you haven’t read them, buy them. They are wonderful. \n\nFor example, you’ll find a knight, who’s just there sitting on his horse. In the distance is a peasant who says: “Look, do you see him? A knight asleep on his horse!” But for him this is nothing exceptional. In fact, that’s how he recognizes it’s a knight. “It’s a knight, do you see him?” He’s leaning on his lance like this. And he’s fast asleep. He sleeps on. And then another knight comes along. They have brief waking periods… [Laughter] He arrives on his errant line, his line of deterritorialization. Or else, the knight who has fallen into a catatonic state and is asleep finds himself in the territory of another knight, who suddenly awakens. And the awakened knight says: “Don’t move!” There’s no danger of him moving in his state. “Don’t move! You hear me?” The other knight hears nothing. There’s a second and then a third call. The three summations of chivalry… On the third call, the conscious knight says: “You have gravely offended me. You don’t answer me.” And he whacks him over the head with his lance or with his broadsword. The other is astonished, the sleeping, catatonic knight wakes up. “Hey what’s this? You hit me!”  \n\nFor those who don’t believe me, I’ll just read you a short extract: “You hit me!” “Three times I addressed you and you made no answer!” “Had you spoken to me, I would have heard you. I didn’t hear anything” “Too bad. You offended me in any case. We must fight!” “Why must we fight?” “I’ve no idea…” \n\nThe search for the Holy Grail is wonderful: they don’t know what they are looking for. They don’t know their own names. They pass the time forgetting their name. Molly is nothing in comparison to Lancelot. He’s really incredible. In one of Chrétien de Troyes’s finest romances, there’s a knight who sees a cart… The story is called “Knight of the Cart.” He looks at it and gets onto it. He doesn’t have any reason for doing so. \n\nIt’s like, many centuries later, Dostoyevsky with his great characters who go out onto the street with a precise objective. They say: “I have to go and see Ivanovich, there’s no time to waste.” Then, when they go out, they suddenly wonder: “What was it I had to do again?” And they set off in the opposite direction. Here again we have faces turning away from one another. A curious game of faciality and landscapity. They no longer know.  Or else… Kafka. K wants to go to the Palace of Justice and gives the address of the bank, or maybe it’s the other way round, I don’t remember… He goes in the other direction. Bizarre things happen. \n\nBut in the case of the Knights who forget even their name and are completely catatonic… Seeing as you are correct in not believing me… [Tape interrupted] [10:50] \n\nHere is a lovely phrase: “The Knight of the Cart is occupied with deep reflections, like one who has no strength or defence against love which holds him in its sway.” You see, it happens very quickly. This is connected to the face of the beloved. “He totally forgets himself, and he knows not whether he is alive or dead, forgetting even his own name, not knowing whether he is armed or not, or whither he is going or whence he came. Only one creature he has in mind and for her…” — which is to say his beloved’s face — “his thought is so occupied that he neither sees or hears aught else. His horse takes him on tortuous paths” and so on. The Knight on guard arrives and he says: “Don’t move!” etc. Three times. And the knight of the cart, who is called Lancelot – it’s the romance of Lancelot – gets whacked on the head. He’s furious, they fight… no it’s not that passage. [Laughter; Deleuze looks through his text] I had noted it down, thinking I would need some evidence… P.153… No, I haven’t underlined it… It’s p.112-113. Maybe… 112-113. No, it’s not that either. Okay, so as I just demonstrated, you won’t have any proof. You’re not going to get it. \n\nHere then is the passage that I would like to read in its entirety because it’s so beautiful and moreover short. And it seems that I’ve lost that too. In the paperback Folio edition… Chrétien de Troye. Perceval, the Story of the Grail. Page 111. \n\nPerceval “saw, before he reached the tents, a flock of wild Geese, dazzled by the heavy Snow” — no need to comment here — “dazzled by the heavy Snow” — I’ll just say straight off that the snow is a white wall.  — “Did he see them? Yes, because they were fleeing as fast as birds can fly from a diving Falcon dropping out of the sky.” — The black hole of the falcon, the white wall of the snow. — “It struck at a single Goose, lagging behind the others, and hit it so hard that it fell to the earth. Perceval arrives too late without being able to [unclear word]. Without waiting he uses both spurs to where the Goose had fallen.” \n\nYou see his line of flight? He set off in search of the grail, he sees some wild geese, and one being struck and falling, and immediately he goes to see what has happened. An epic or dramatic hero would never do such a thing. But this is the specificity of the novel, beginning with the “poor guy”. It’s the ballad of the poor guy who doesn’t know his name, who doesn’t know… When Achilles retires to his tent, it’s a whole different story. It’s an epic. It’s not the same kind of faciality. The faciality of the novel, tragic or dramatic faciality, and epic faciality are very different things. \n\nSo, he goes to take a look. “The bird’s neck had been wounded, and three drops of blood had come rolling out on the snow, dying it vivid red. The bird had not been badly hurt, just knocked to the earth, and before the knight could reach it, it had flown away in the sky, and Perceval sees at his feet the snow where it has been resting and the still evident blood. And Perceval, leaning on his lance, contemplated the sight of the blood and snow so mixed together.” \n\nHe leans on his lance and looks. I’m saying this is landscapity. That “fresh color” – he looks at the three drops of blood on the snow, instead of carrying on with his knightly tasks. But this is precisely his task. The line of deterritorialization. \n\nThat “fresh color”, the three drops of blood on the snow were “just like his beloved’s face”, and his beloved – if I’m not mistaken – is called Blanchefleur, and she continues to abandon him because he always has something else to accomplish although he doesn’t know what it is. And you know that, historically, courtly love was established as a line of flight with respect to conjugality. It was the great movement… the great social line of flight in an active reaction to conjugality. Or should we say the reverse? \n\n“Blood and snow so mixed together created a fresh color, just like his beloved’s face, and as he stared he forgot what he was doing and where he was. The red stain against the white snow seemed just like her complexion. Before the king awakens…” – the king too is always asleep in the novel… King Arthur is fantastic, in this sense… Again, he’s nothing like the kings of epics or the king of Shakespearean drama for example. He sleeps so deeply that a valet can pass by and knock his crown off with his elbow and he says: “You didn’t do it on purpose? Very well.” [Laughter]\n\nSo, “hey you over there”… [“Before the king awakens”], another guy appears, actually, several guys, “We’ve seen an knight out there, sleeping on his horse.” – “Is he bearing arms?” — “Oh yes, indeed!” — “I’ll go and talk to him… I’ll bring him to court!”, to the court of King Arthur. He has to bring back Lancelot… No, Perceval, but it won’t be an easy task, as Perceval doesn’t hear anything. He fights once again. Then they bring him before the king. And he explains, “oh, I just didn’t hear anything”, or something of the sort… [Tape interrupted] [19:16]\n\n… In courtly love, there is a whole overcoding that happens through the face in reaction to conjugal relationships. So, we have this theme. And there’s also the theme of the two faces. Perceval thinks of the face of Blanchefleur. Perceval-Blanchefleur. Perceval-Blanchefleur. So, we have this kind of passional faciality. There’s the white wall – the snow with the three drops of blood on it – the black hole, which is both the falcon that attacks the geese and the catatonia, the black hole of passional catatonia into which Perceval falls. \n\nAnd, lastly, there is a system of decomposition where traits of landscapity, traits of faciality, the exit from the black hole – all this becomes mixed to form a very curious thing. And we shouldn’t be surprised, because if we take this complex — in the most ordinary sense of “complex”, that is, the combination of a group of things — if we take our complex: white wall, face, white line, black hole, face inscribed on the white wall flowing towards the black hole, if we take all this together, we can say that each of the various elements pertains to very different semiotics, very different systems of signs.\n\nYet on the other hand, the whole forms a mixed semiotics. It’s no surprise that the signifying face of the despot on the white wall already contains, already comprises, several black holes. Nor is it surprising that the passional system of black holes still contains a residue of white wall, if only in the form of the diachronic line. This melange shouldn’t surprise us. It can only be seen at the third level… of a more elaborate study. Not by chance in courtly love is the lady often referred to as the “white lady.” The white lady. Blanchefleur. The knight’s catatonia functions as a black hole, the lady as a white wall, with the vermillion of her cheeks daubed on the wall. Or, perhaps, her eyes are already black holes. Everything is mixed in a semiotics that involves all the components. And our task is to unravel it. So that’s the second remark I wanted to make… [Tape interrupted] [22:37]\n\nAnd now, to finish, before you start to speak, I want to show you a proof without saying where it comes from. Here is a face. There’s no question this is a demon, a demon from afar, from Ethiopia. The eyes are black holes. The black hole is surrounded by a coiled serpent. Each time you have a coiled serpent, you can – though it’s not obligatory, there are no rules in magic – you can place an eye in it. So, what’s the result? — The figure is a bit small, but I’ll try to show it to you. [Pause] I’m annoyed that I’ve lost the most beautiful of the Ethiopian demons I had. [Pause ; he keeps looking, then finds it] The most beautiful one is this one … [Pause] It’s a masterpiece. [Pause] Can everyone see it? [Pause] It’s really so beautiful. [Pause] You can get a better look later… I’ll pass it around. \n\nIt’s on papyrus, so it’s yellowish. White wall, black hole. But what is it? You remember the stories of Ethiopia? And here we return to the question of power. It’s true what they say. The Negus, before being deposed, had an extraordinary court of magicians and his black hole-like gaze was well-known. And the Negus had descended from a whole series, a whole lineage, beginning from Solomon in which the eyes were defined as black holes. The magic power of the black hole. And the Negus, when making his rounds of the peasant villages, relied on this magic, which is typically Ethiopian – which is why I wanted to show you this example. \n\nThere’s just one other case I can think of like this, but which is very different: certain documents published in the Cahiers de l’Art Brut. For example, for those of you’ve heard of an artist like [Adolf] Wölfli, who was for a long time interned in Switzerland, I believe… he made only faces composed of a circle and eyes like black holes. Or else another famous exponent of Art Brut, Aloïse [Aloïse Corbaz], who also makes black hole-eyes… Today I had too much to carry but next time I’ll bring you some of her drawings. She was also interned for a long time. In different ways the drawings of both Wölfli and Aloïse are pure black holes placed against a white background that is full of miniatures, etc.\n\nSo here is my second observation, which is a bit confused. And I repeat: “Don’t pass this image around!” Why did I want to say that? [Deleuze refers here to a student’s comment in the first part of this session, under ATP I.3] Because there’s an error, a risk of error in what I said. One might think that the first figure of face, which I called signifying despotic face, a single face viewed frontally, is like a unity that gathers together the different traits of faciality, while in the other figure there are at least two faces that are seen in profile, or that turn away from one another, and flow towards the black hole. At a certain level, one can say this. \n\nBut at a more rigorous and profound level, we have to admit that every face, whatever its figure, is by nature a multiplicity. It’s just that I believe the first type of face – the signifying despotic face – is a multiplicity of frequency. That’s why in the Ethiopian etchings, the Ethiopian scrolls, each time you make a circle you have the possibility of inserting an eye. The face of the despot is a multiplicity of frequency. While the face of the beloved, the passional face, is a multiplicity of resonance. That is, our two general types of faciality correspond to our two forms of redundancy, and the reason for this is simple: faciality is on one hand the substance of the signifier while, on the other, it is the attribute of subjectivity. So, it’s normal that our redundancies – the way we have distinguished them – are found precisely at the level of the face, as both substance and attribute of redundancy. Okay, so here we have a second grouping of things to investigate… [Pause, then tape interrupted] [28:37]\n\nDeleuze: … There’s a wonderful example — I add this because I would like speak at least once about this author  — in Henry Miller, who has always confronted the question in these terms: Can I break through the wall? Which wall are we talking about here? Even at the level of universal history, Miller hallucinates. He’s one of the great delirious writers. There are two peoples who’ve confronted the wall. We don’t know what this wall is. He doesn’t need to tell us. American writers do better than philosophy here. He says there are two peoples: the Jews and the Chinese. What a surprise! The Jews failed at the last moment. They rebounded onto a phenomenon that was invented by Christ: subjectivity. And there are some fantastic pages on this. They bounced off the wall and fell into a black hole. The black hole of Christ and the passion of Christ. The Chinese, thanks to Buddhism – Miller says – passed through the wall, by way of a series of metamorphoses, animal becomings, musical becomings, all kinds of weird things, because you can’t break through the wall without becomings. [Tape interrupted] [30:08]\n\n … He throws himself into a kind of becoming masochist. And this is what happens. He bounces off the wall and falls into a black hole, which is the lesbian couple whose slave he becomes, and from then on he speaks only in barks: woof woof, bow wow… It’s the end of Sexus and the beginning of Nexus that are expressed through Miller’s barking. When he doesn’t manage to break through the wall, rather than becoming-animal, he becomes a little dog. So, what’s going on here? It’s all very ambiguous. Because bow wow wow… becoming a little dog is also a becoming-animal of sorts… We no longer understand anything… But it’s better this way, everything is mixed up. [Pause] Yes… [Tape interrupted] [31:05]\n\nGeorges Comtesse: Concerning marital conjugality in the 12th century, which was extremely strong, with its virility and all the phallocratic power of past epochs towards, let’s say the “forced” bride… There was all this. And the lady constituted herself as a lady with this demand for love, making conjugality collapse by demanding a courtly lover. But also, the reverse happens because at the same time as she makes conjugality collapse, while not recomposing it, she nonetheless confirms another conjugality from which, it seems to me, we haven’t yet managed to free ourselves and which might have a role in what you were saying when you spoke about falling asleep… which is perhaps a kind of awakening after all. \n\nWhat I want to say by this is that, in order to constitute herself as the lady that demands love and imposes upon the Knight, the lover, a virginal surface of voluptuousness, that of whiteness for example – Blanchefleur, who might fascinate an obsessive like Bresson – whatever you like… The lady, the so-called subjugated woman, is above all fascinated by her rebellion which at the time could only be on the sly… she’s completely fascinated – and anyone who has studied courtly love understands this – by a certain type of conjugality which perhaps still exists, the conjugality of male brotherhood. Male brotherhood, the couple formed by two men linked by a male friendship or love: this is what fascinates the courtly lady and provokes her becoming-lady or her attempts to recompose, or remake conjugality, by removing one of the partners of that couple to her own benefit… [Tape interrupted] [33:26]\n\nDeleuze: … Regarding the specific question of blood brotherhood and courtly love, that was the only moment when your own intervention became a bit sly, because you were invoking scholarly authority, and doing that is always a bit maladroit… because at that moment everyone senses that what you’re saying isn’t completely true. You said that all the specialists of courtly love know it, and this isn’t the case. They have animated discussions on the rapport between different customs of blood brotherhood. But we can’t take for granted what you were saying in that regard, even if the rest was very stimulating and fruitful, and we should add it to our reflections. \n\nBut I interrupted Félix for a moment [This reference is probably to early in the session, in the previous segment of ATP I.3, unless some omission occurred in editing the current session] and, before he begins to speak again, I just wanted to quickly read — and I’ll read this again later so you can think about it for next week – a short passage by Henry Miller, which is very apt since it contains certain words… I admit I’ve sometimes cheated a bit with citations but this time all the words are there, I don’t need to add any. I also checked the English version, which is almost identical. [Deleuze reads here from Miller’s Tropic of Capricorn (New York: Grove Press, 1961), p. 239] He’s speaking about his relationship with a woman he loved, and he says: \n\n“She was never a being, such as might finally be caught in repose, but the mechanism itself” – that is, she was the mechanism itself — “relentlessly operating the myriad mirrors which would reflect the myth she had created. She had no poise whatsoever; she was eternally poised above her multiple identities in the vacuum of the self… In the dark, locked away in the black hole with no world looking on…” Here he’s trying to describe the black hole of love-passion, and he asks himself how he’s going to get out, without becoming the dog who goes bow wow. \n\n“In the dark, locked away in the black hole with no world looking on, no adversary, no rivals, the blinding dynamism of the will slowed down a bit, gave her a molten copperish glow…” — the floating of the face — “gave her a molten copperish glow, the words coming out of her mouth like lava, her flesh clutching ravenously for a hold, a perch on something solid and substantial, something in which to reintegrate and repose for a few moments. It was like a frantic long-distance message, an S.O.S. from a sinking ship.”  \n\nAnd here we get to the essential: “At first I mistook it for passion, for the ecstasy produced by flesh rubbing against flesh…” — Hence, love-passion, thrown into the element of passion — “At first, I mistook it for passion, for the ecstasy produced by flesh rubbing against flesh. I thought I had found a living volcano, a female Vesuvius…” — and I don’t think there’s anything phallocratic in the following phrase — “I never thought of a human ship going down in an ocean of despair, in a Sargasso of impotence. Now…” — he says of this woman that he loved — “Now I think of that black star” — black star, black hole — “gleaming through the hole in the ceiling, that fixed star which hung above our conjugal cell, more fixed, more remote than the Absolute, and I know it was her, emptied of all that was properly herself: a dead black sun without aspect.” \n\nThat’s beautiful. It really is the path of love-passion into the black hole that it traces, passing by way of faciality. I wish I had written that. It’s beautiful. So anyway, I interrupted Félix…\n\nGuattari: I would like to sketch out… to take up again one aspect of the problem, because I think that if it might seem like nit-picking at the moment, maybe later this will become more significant, this oscillation that you were speaking of, between the two and the three which, by the way, forms part of the dimensions of structuralist ways of thinking. The question is… wait, let me finish, otherwise we’ll never get anywhere. \n\nComtesse: I meant in the sense of an entanglement, not a progression… \n\nGuattari: Listen to me… [Tape interrupted] [39 :12]\n\nGuattari: The deterritorializing movement provoked by the semiotic collapse that brings one to latch onto not merely the face, but even just a hole in the face, can happen because the coordinates, the “natural”, ancestral territorial references have collapsed. So, the decoded lines of society, desire’s lines of flight, throw themselves at the available hooks and holds. They race towards the abyss, towards nothing. We have to reconstitute artificial points of reterritorialization, which will be faces, couple relations, identities, roles, functions, nationalities, you name it. \n\nThis fabrication of subjectivation isn’t merely a disaster, a race towards the void that we could define in Goethe’s words as a function of the demonic in which different numbers follow a regressive path. It’s not merely a Romantic-style catastrophe. It is, at the same time, a positive function of the construction of a certain type of society – whether capitalist, socialist, bureaucratic, whatever…  It’s the condition for setting in motion an operation of juncture, work, fusion between semiotic systems, systems of production and social systems, which may also have a diagrammatic function different from the post-signifying regime Gilles was speaking about. \n\nTo be able to pass to these sign machines, which will function in science, production, social organization, through the worst despotism ever seen within territorialized systems, there must first be an operation of tabula rasa, blank page, a sweeping of the beach, the crushing of all previous semiotic features, all the old territorialized semiotic components. And once we’ve attained this kind of collapse, like the crumbling of… I don’t know, like a kind of semiotic atom bomb or else cosmic black holes that lose all their normal coordinates… what is it that happens? \n\nIn the background of this beach-sweeping operation, there will be a system of overcoding, a system of seizing power over all the old semiotic components and materials of expression. That is to say, all the old forms of organization will be swallowed up by a particular new system of semiotic power grab, which will be the instrument of all other power grabs corresponding to capitalist formations – and these will no longer function through a more or less rhizomatic co-existence of systems of semiotization (through body, space, tattoos, word, ritual, dance and so on) but through the overcoding of quanta of information. \n\nThese quanta organize, subsuming within a single formula or machine, the different quantities of formalisms that are prefabricated everywhere else – unlike all other types of organization that bring into play systems of signs which maintain openings: that is to say quanta of possibility. In the quanta of information, the only possibilities available are always pre-formatted. In diagrammatic systems – that is, when we break with this flattening of all the different semiotics on a single plane: the signifier – there are quanta of possibility that consist in passing from one stratum of coding to another. For example, we can pass from the world of the orchid to that of the wasp, from the world of energetic strata to that of semiotic strata, from one functioning of desire to another, without all of this being pre-programmed and ordered by the system… [Tape interrupted] [43:42]\n\nDeleuze: Kleist never ceases making programs, his programs are very peculiar. He calls them programs but we’re not sure that’s what they are… [Tape interrupted] [43:58]\n\nDeleuze: As workers say and feel, they are sick and tired of clocking in at 8 o’clock, 8:30 in the morning and so on… [Deleuze turns toward a student] And what were you saying about this preprogrammed life? Are you saying programs don’t exist, that they don’t work?\n\nA student: They work, the workers have mistresses, or even others…\n\nDeleuze: But having mistresses can be programmed, conjugality with a mistress can be programmed…\n\nThe student: Then they’ll do something else, that’s it! That’s it! There’s a possible opening…\n\nDeleuze: But of course! What do you think we’re saying? Of course, there is a possible opening…\n\nGuattari: The workers might have mistresses, but…\n\nThe student: But even if there is an opening, they immediately fall into [unclear word], they fall into [unclear word], they fall again into dialectics.\n\nDeleuze: They do what? \n\nThe student: They fall into dialectics.\n\nDeleuze: Why?…  [End of the recording] [44:53]\n\n"

Purdue University Research Repository. doi:10.4231/7A4Z-DK57\n\n\n\n\nGilles Deleuze\n\nDeleuze & Guattari at Vincennes, 1975-76\n\nIl Senso in Meno, Part 5 – Faciality, White Screen, Three Theorems of Deterritorialization \n\nTranslated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; transcription, Charles J. Stivale\n\n[Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions]\n\nThere’s an article by Lewin… You can find it in this issue of Nouvelle revue de psychoanalyse, just after the Isakower text. [See A Thousand Plateaus, p. 169 and p. 532 note 4; the reference is Bertram D. Lewin, “Le sommeil, la bouche et l’écran du rêve”, Nouvelle revue de psychanalyse, 5 (Spring 1972) pp. 211-224, and Otto Isakower, “Contribution a la psychopathologie des phenomenes associes a I’endormissement, » ibid., pp. 197-210)] In this article, Lewin discovers a white screen of the dream. We could also call it a white wall of the dream. The white screen of the dream, that one normally doesn’t see… Why not? According to Lewin, we don’t see the white screen of the dream because it is usually covered by the dream’s visual contents. And seeing as how Lewin is nonetheless a Freudian, just as one might predict, the dream’s visual contents express the desires – but it’s the white screen of desire – that come to trouble sleep. However, for Lewin this white screen expresses something else, not the desires that trouble sleep but the desire to sleep. This is obviously why we don’t see it. There’s only one case where we see it: when the dream lacks visual content, that is when the dream is for the most part, or else entirely, made up of vague proprioceptive sensations. You see how he’s trying to catch up with Isakower. The white screen of dream appears to the dreamer only when the dream is without visual content, when its only contents are those of a proprioceptive nature – manual, cutaneous and so on, as Isakower defines them.\n\nSpitz adds the white screen. The white wall. He too being a Freudian, and always adding something to Isakower while preserving his theory, Spitz wonders what the white screen is. And he says that the white screen is again the mommy’s breast. The white wall, the white screen are mommy’s breast. It’s odd… How can the white screen be mommy’s breast? It’s not difficult, says Spitz – no, sorry… I meant to say Lewin. Spitz will have something else to say. According to Lewin, it’s when the suckling baby experiences the approach of its mother’s breast, getting larger and then pressing flat.\n\nBizarre, wouldn’t you say? The mother’s breast approaches the baby and, as it does so, it gets larger and flattens. And it loses its volume… I always get this wrong: concave or convex? Convex? I don’t know… you work it out! And then it forms a white screen. As you see, Lewin adds two points to Isakower’s study: a white screen appears precisely when the dream still lacks visual content. And then this white screen represents the breast that approaches and presses flat… [Tape interrupted] [4:10]\n\n… Spitz says that the white screen has a role that Lewin hasn’t noticed. It’s not at all the breast approaching and flattening out. That’s not what it represents. It’s the face of the mother, which the child uses as a guide to find the breast. In this way, he manages to combine Isakower’s sensation of contact with visual perception from a distance. And like many other pediatricians, he concludes that from very early on, the child uses the mother’s face as a guide. But what are the conditions of the face it sees? It sees it from the front, though blurred, a white stain on which some kind of holes are vaguely defined: the holes of the eyes. And this takes on crucial importance with regard to feeding… [Tape interrupted] [5:26]\n\nAs long as the mouth and eyes are treated as… volumes or cavities, they are not yet… and here we need a new word: facialized. In more simple terms I would almost say that they still form part of the body. The facialization of the mouth and nose perhaps imply certain operations that presuppose the white wall, or the white screen, the eyes as black holes. A whole facialization that is not pre-established. So, in saying this, we must also say that there is a facialization of the breast… [Tape interrupted] [6:32]\n\n… The third phase of organization of the face might consist in a series of genetic stages. But this doesn’t really tell us anything. We have the impression that it isn’t like that, it isn’t true, that’s not the way it happens.\n\nNor do we wish to see it in terms of phenomenological positions. That’s not what happens either. It’s not like that. It’s not a confrontation of gazes, the gaze of the baby seeking the gaze of the mother. In such an approach, we hear the galloping hooves of spiritualism approaching. That’s not it. And the proof of this is that for the baby it functions even when the mother is masked. A mask with two holes. Or else, when the mask has eyes, it tries to pull at them, to tear them off like two little balls.\n\nSo, we won’t bother with phenomenological positions. We’re tired of all that. And, naturally, there’s another approach we also refuse. We absolutely do not want this to be a question of partial-object integration. And yet we feel that there is that danger; it’s … ooo, there’s danger here; the baby’s hand, the mouth, breast, eyes, the white wall to integrate them all. Why don’t we want this? Because we’re extremely distrustful regarding partial objects. We have the impression that that’s not the way our machine functions because what is this business of partial-object integration anyway? Here we see the return of the baby’s split-up body that would be integrated little by little and then… this list of objects: hand, breast, mouth, eyes… one could add others to the list. We could make a list of such objects. Fine, we’d prefer not to; no, it’s not that we don’t want to, but we’d prefer not to do this.\n\nAnd, as a last point, neither do we wish to have anything to do with a structuring-structural organization. Because even in this case, imagining there is a beginning, if we consider our abstract machine without knowing what it does, knowing only that it works, that the little balls move and there is the white wall and the black hole… then we can say it works, even if we don’t know to what purpose. It’s a whole different field to that of partial objects or of structuring-structural organizations or of genetic axes and what have you.\n\nSo, what might it be for? How can be pose the problem? To gain more clarity, I’ll try to give you the answer, otherwise if I pretend to discover it, the whole thing becomes too confusing… Perhaps we can say the following: The body is endowed with movement. It shouldn’t be thought of in terms of objects but in terms of its movement. You will tell me I’m not saying anything new. Everyone knows the body moves. But it’s not these movements we want to talk about. What interests us are movements of a more secret nature. The body is endowed with intensive movements. [Much of the discussion that follows is developed somewhat differently in plateau 3, “The Geology of Morals”, in A Thousand Plateaus]\n\nWhat are these intensive movements? Even if we’ve already often used this formula – for the moment we won’t seek to justify it – compared to the animal body, the human body is animated by movements of deterritorialization. The human body is a deterritorialized animal body. Remember that wonderful passage in Nietzsche when for the first time the fish leaves the swamp and breathes air… Little by little, it raises itself on its hind feet. The whole story of the human body’s arrival at vertical stature is a vast tale of deterritorialization.\n\nLet’s look at some examples, let’s not think in terms of partial-object integration but rather in terms of composition of relative movements of deterritorialization. I need only go back to my list: the hand. The hand, as is well known, is a paw. It’s generally agreed that the hand is a deterritorialized forepaw, literally ripped from the ground. This at least is a fact.\n\nWhat’s more, primary school textbooks distinguish between the so-called musculoskeletal hand – that of the monkey swinging from branch to branch – and the prehensile hand. And it can be said that the musculoskeletal hand represents a second degree of deterritorialization in relation to the paw, while the prehensile hand represents a third degree of deterritorialization. So, this free hand… at the same time has a correlative. Interesting… We never deterritorialize alone, but we deterritorialize at least in two.\n\nAnd this, [Pause, Deleuze writes something on the board] this means it’s important, this matter, it is important for us. We will never treat the hand as a partial-object. That’s a butcher’s idea, to say that the hand is a partial object. It’s pure Frankenstein. Or that the eyes are partial objects. It makes no sense. It’s no good, it’s for those who chop people up into pieces, the anatomists. They’ll have quite a job making the body function through partial-object integration. It’s a disgrace. For us the hand isn’t a severed hand, it’s not a partial object but the support of a movement. Let’s try to find a better word. It’s the agent of a movement of deterritorialization that must literally be qualified, measured, quantified. There are speeds of deterritorialization. I said that one never deterritorializes alone.\n\nSo, what does the hand’s deterritorialization have as its complement? The tool-object, the use-object. When the hand ceases to be musculoskeletal and becomes prehensile what does it grab hold of? What it seizes, even if it happens to be a breast, is the use-object. The tool. What we will call machine is already this. I’m not saying it’s the machine in its totality, but it is the assemblage of the two. So that’s the first level.\n\nSecond level: the mouth. Is it a partial object? Note how I don’t yet posit a face, I haven’t posited a face. I treat the mouth as a cavity that is part of the animal body, part of what we call the muzzle or head. But it doesn’t belong to a face. It wouldn’t be good if I already gave myself a face.\n\nSo, the mouth… [Pause, Deleuze points again to the drawing on the board] here as well, it’s not a partial object; it’s an agent of deterritorialization. And why, and why is this? Obviously, it’s not the same as for the hand. This is why we have to compare all these movements of deterritorialization and constitute a body, not like some idiot partial object integration but – no, I erase this last remark – so not like some partial object integration, as Melanie Klein so elegantly said, but like… – no, I erase that… — the simultaneous place, the simultaneous agent of a vector and a movement of deterritorialization, with different intensities and velocities. And everything happens at once. There’s no primacy in the connections, they all link up with one another.\n\nSo why is also the mouth swept up in a movement of deterritorialization? Because – and I hope this is true since I only found it in a text written by a German professor called [Hermann] Klaatch [See A Thousand Plateaus, p. 533, note 6] – who says something quite splendid. He studied to be a vet and he says: Humans, not even hominids, but only humans have lips. What a revelation! Only humans have lips. Even if some humans don’t, but this concerns faciality. What does this mean that only humans have lips? He doesn’t say much about it but there’s one very lyrical passage. I’ll read it to you later because it’s quite charming, like a little ballet of the face. He speaks so well that you can tell this is someone who knows his subject.\n\nBut what does that mean? The lips, which are so important for the human mouth, are the mucous membranes that extrudes. It’s rare, it’s very singular, a mucous membrane that extrudes. If I’m not wrong, animals don’t have lips. Which means that their external skin hardens, I hope. And yet I’m disturbed when I look at a cow because it seems like it has lips, but it surely isn’t the case. It’s the external skin that hardens. In this sense the cow’s head is part of its body. I have the impression that apes… but sadly the professor doesn’t speak about this. I don’t know but if you look closely at an ape, it seems to have a kind of… hardening of the skin. It’s not at all the inversion of the internal mucous membranes.\n\nI implore you… if anyone has an objection, please keep it for yourself. [Laughter] It’s essential. In any case, we would have to ask a vet: if any of you know one, ask them. But they will only say yes, and if they say no… look hard until you find a vet who says yes. However, it’s not that important. Let’s suppose that next week someone tells us it’s false. It’s not important. You have to understand that there are two types of lips, which are completely different. I mean to say, there’s a point at which an idea cannot be false. It becomes impossible.\n\nI’ll say that the human mouth has lips and that the lips are a deterritorialized mouth. The mucous membranes which form the walls of the bodily cavity, in extruding themselves become deterritorialized. The deterritorialization of the muzzle, the head, I don’t know what to call it, through the human mouth, is very different from the deterritorialization of the hand… but that doesn’t mean they don’t go together. It too has a correlative. But what is it? The same professor teaches us that only humans have a mouth endowed with lips but only women have breasts. Irrefutably so.\n\nWhat do animals have? They have what are technically referred to as mammary glands. Any vet will make a distinction between mammary glands and breasts. And the difference is the following: the breast is a deterritorialized mammary gland. Because of its vertical stature. But why is this? What is the difference? The technical difference appears to be that the breast is a mammary gland surrounded by adipose and muscular tissue. Therefore, while the mouth with its lips is a deterritorialized muzzle, the breast is a deterritorialized mammary gland. Here I would add something quite significant: already in my two couples, hand-tool or hand-use object and mouth-breast, we can identify a first law of deterritorialization. It’s fun to make a series of laws, or theorems of deterritorialization.\n\nHere is the first theorem of deterritorialization: when two organs are deterritorialized in a complementary rapport, one reterritorializes on the other and vice versa. [This list of theorems differs from the list given in A Thousand Plateaus starting on p. 174] So, a theorem of great clarity. The hand is a paw, the prehensile hand is a deterritorialized paw or a deterritorialized musculoskeletal hand that has become empty, ripped from the earth or the trees. Its correlative is the tool, which at a lower level is a deterritorialized material… [Tape interrupted] [24:13]\n\n… Territoriality, deterritorialization and reterritorialization constitute three notions that are not reducible to each other. Reterritorialization is a highly specific operation. Usually, it occurs in the context of what we call artifice or artifact. An artificial tool. The breast… okay, if we don’t yet have an artifice in vertical breastfeeding, the baby bottle is in any case an artifact. So, the mouth’s reterritorialization on the breast and that of the breast on the mouth constitutes breastfeeding.\n\nAnd here we have a further deterritorialization. Notice that I remain within the dimensions of the deterritorialized body. Even the mouth I consider a cavity. I said that the mucous membrane extrudes: the mouth still pertains to the body. Third deterritorialization: the face, which here is fully the deterritorialized animal head, following which… I will tell you later. Obviously, it’s not the genetic axis, the paw which became a hand, vertical stature, a thousand other things.\n\nThe face I will define not through the mouth but precisely through the eyes, the eyes that see. The story of the gaze is valid for animals. It’s animals that look. It’s the human face that sees without looking. Which is why it’s so horrible. It really is a horror story that I’m recounting. The partial object is nothing by comparison. The real horror. The eyes, the face… what do they do? In any case, I am saying, we have a movement of deterritorialization that is perhaps more… much more intense… which doesn’t mean it isn’t much slower than the others. By being slower it arrives at its goal, at its aim, less quickly. Hence, the illusion of the genetic stages… [Tape interrupted] [27:21]\n\n… The second theorem of deterritorialization: faster deterritorializations do not necessarily come first. What’s more, faster movements presuppose slower ones… [Tape interrupted] [27:44]\n\n… What is the first landscape, after all? As many authors have shown, the first landscape is the steppe. It’s there that for the first time the gazeless eyes see. On the steppe. Before, we had to look. Why? The old evolutionists explain it well. The first environment, the real animal Umwelt is the forest. Note that in the forest there are no hands, no prehensile… no, sorry, I meant musculoskeletal hands. The ape swings from one branch to another. Perhaps we have the beginnings of a prehensile hand, but very, very limited. There’s no mouth, no face. Nor is there a voice. There’s too much noise in the forest to be able to speak. They can’t speak. The apes have, to use a nice expression, laryngeal sacs that don’t enable them to speak. You need a supple larynx to be able to speak, and in the forest, they don’t have that. It’s not possible. The supple larynx is a deterritorialized larynx. Everywhere we are traversed by movements of deterritorialization.\n\nAnd I was saying that the steppe is the first landscape. It’s the complement of the face. The face reterritorializes on the steppe and the steppe reterritorializes on the face. But what is the steppe? It’s a deterritorialized forest.\n\nAnd here we come to my third theorem of deterritorialization. Up until now we’ve only considered complementary reterritorializations at the same level. The hand reterritorializes on the tool and the tool on the hand, the mouth on the breast and the breast on the mouth, the face on the landscape and the landscape on the face. But in the other sense, I make a scale, an intensive scale. An intensive scale that I define in function of the relative speed and intensity of the deterritorializing movements that take place at each level. I’ve already looked at three, one, two, three.\n\nAnd here I would add that those that take place more slowly are the first to occur. The last to arrive are the first to occur. That’s why genetic psychology gets it wrong, as do theories of partial objects. This way, we can get rid of them all in one fell swoop. Good. And, in this case, all this happens from lowest to highest, from fastest to slowest. A reterritorialization of the faster movements on the slower… [Tape interrupted]\n\nI’m almost done with this… and now at least we have the solution to our second set of notions. Sorry if I spoke at such length… I will stop before the third — what time is it now? — so that you might speak a bit. We have a solution, or at least the confirmation of a solution: this business of power apparatuses.\n\nIf I go from one to two to three, I can say that the third – face-landscape – is at the same time the slowest movement and yet the most intensive, and therefore the most deterritorialized. That of the hand is the fastest. It is already a deterritorialization with a complementary reterritorialization. And it is the least deterritorialized. Reterritorialization occurs from the least to the most deterritorialized. And that’s what the artifice is. So, third theorem: we call artifice a reterritorialization of the least deterritorialized on the most deterritorialized.\n\nSo then, [Deleuze laughs] everything works out fine! No, I’ll stop there, you’re fed up with all this. [He continues laughing, pause, he turns toward the drawing on the board] So, yes, everything works out fine. We shouldn’t be surprised that certain power apparatuses need both face and landscape. It’s the same forces that establish faces and make environments. So, are these the same forces that need to keep us attached to a white wall or to plunge us into a black hole? Without doubt.\n\nSo, these power apparatuses would need both the abstract machine of faciality – white wall-black hole – and the concrete movements of deterritorialization, that is: the most deterritorialized on which everything artificially reterritorializes – just as we said at the beginning when we began this study of the face – will overcode that which has lost its code.\n\nAnd what is it that has lost its code? Everything that pertained to territoriality, that is to say the animal body or human corporeality which has never ceased to be deterritorialized, more and more, and to be reterritorialized by artifice and which, having lost the codes of corporeality, must be overcoded, thus so many that we have lost corporeality with maintenance of territorialities; even if these territorialities are of a nomad type – what we call “primitives”… nomadic, semi nomadic or sedentary peoples — there is absolutely no need for faciality, nor for power apparatuses that produce face, nor for their abstract machines. These peoples have their own, but not of that type. They have other abstract machines: abstract machines of dance, abstract machines of gesture… [End of the recording] [36:28]\n\n"

Purdue University Research Repository. doi:10.4231/XN3H-MW51\n\n\n\n\nGilles Deleuze\n\nDeleuze & Guattari at Vincennes, 1975-76\n\nIl Senso in Meno, Part 6 – Rhizomes, Assemblages of Power and Territorialized Assemblages of Enunciation\n\nTranslated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; revisions and time stamp, Charles J. Stivale\n\n[Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions]\n\n[From the tenor of Deleuze’s opening remarks, in the first two minutes, as well as from his clothing and from the drawing that dominates the blackboard – the fourth, four-cornered drawing reproduced in A Thousand Plateaus (p. 183) –, this session’s start is in all likelihood the end of another session for which we lack what precedes, marked distinctly from the session that opens after the first session interruption at time mark 2:19]\n\nDeleuze: I can say that since we began, everything we have done up to this point, from the start, is to consider three topics. The first of these was the rhizome in opposition to the tree. The second topic was to investigate or sketch out a sort of theory of redundancy. Thirdly, we looked at a particular problem: the problem of faciality. Do I think there is something that links all of this? In a way, they relate to the same thing but in a kind of magma because, behind the screen, behind the wall, or outside of the black hole, when the different lines enter into new relationships… landscapity… that is… when faces come undone to the benefit of their traits, when landscapes are unmade and no longer hold in place their traits of landscapity, everything enters into new relationships. That’s when the rhizome begins. Black holes are like knots of arborescence.\n\nEverything we’ve said up to now is connected. This is obvious, since we’ve seen how necessary the face is in building redundancies – whether redundancies of resonance or redundancies of frequency. I would say that the redundancies of frequency were the first figure of the face. If you multiply the black holes on the white surface… Redundancies of resonance constitute the second figure. Faces flow towards the black hole, that is, all faces will come to resonate in a single black hole. So, there you have it. Next time we’ll look at a different topic… [Tape interrupted; here ends the summary of the five preceding sessions, quite possibly in a sixth session for which the recording is missing] [2:19]\n\n[Here begins the next session, February 3, 1976] … [We’ll continue], if you bear with me, focussing on two essential points. Firstly, the face-power assemblage, because in this rapport there’s something we still have to consider, something I still can’t figure out. Why do power assemblages need faciality? The second topic, if we don’t have time, I would like some of you more qualified than me to speak about it next time… is the question of the close-up… the question of the close up in the history of cinema and the role of both the face and the close-up in cinema. What worries me… do you really want to say something?\n\nA student (near Deleuze): No, no…\n\nAnother student: [Inaudible]\n\nA third student: A question, may I? I’d like to ask a question.\n\nThe second student: [Inaudible]\n\nThe third student: The next time, I want to talk about the French language!\n\nAnother student: Ah, we know all about that.\n\nThe third student: No, no, no, no, no. Will you let me have just one minute?\n\nThe other student: Just one minute?\n\nThe third student: Yes, yes… [Comments lost in the general noise]\n\nDeleuze: Will you stop bickering all the time? It’s exhausting!\n\nAnother student: I’m not asking a question. I want to tell a story if you let me…\n\nAnother student: So, let’s hear your story then.\n\nThe first student: Thank you! Are there others who want me to tell it? [Deleuze is heard laughing; pause and relative silence of students]\n\nDeleuze: Yes, there’s… I don’t know, there’s a problem that worries me… It’s the story — I also have a story — the assemblages of power, you recall, we began with a very simple idea. On the white wall of the signifier, the signifier inscribes its characters, which are not information but orders. “You will do this!” and it’s at this point that the face intervenes. The face intervenes because it guides us in what linguists famously call binary choices. These binary choices are for example: What did I hear? Did I hear “old billiard” or “old pillager”? What was it? What did I hear? [On this example, see Michel Foucault, Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel, trans. Charles Ruas, (New York: Continuum, 2004, 15). Deleuze adopts his example from Roussel frequently, notably in Logic of Sense, trans. Mark Lester with Charles J. Stivale, ed. Constantin V. Boundas (1969; New York: Columbia University Press, 1990), pp. 38-39; new ed. (New York and London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 41. See also sessions 14, 15 and 16 in the Cinema seminar 4 (March 5, 12 and 19, 1985), and session 7 in the current seminar (December 12, 1985)]\n\nAnd if the face makes redundancy with the redundancies of language, it’s because I let the face guide me. What does it mean when traits of faciality escape the face? For example, all at once a teacher who appeared serious and had the trust of the headmistress starts acting crazy. Or, and this is stated by a famous name [The phrase cited next is one that Deleuze attributed to Kierkegaard, Traité du désespoir, although according to Ronald Bogue, the phrase is not found in the Kierkegaard text; see Bogue, “The Art of the Possible,” Revue internationale de philosophie, 24.3 (2007), p. 278], a respectable man sitting at the dinner table with his wife and children suddenly blows it, undoes his collar and screams: “The possible or I shall suffocate!” The children fix their black holes on daddy while the mother says: “The possible or I shall suffocate? What?” And we look at his face and we see that he no longer has one. The traits of faciality have freed themselves from the face’s domination.\n\nFacial tics are very moving. A tic, a tic… it’s a kind of gentle effort, an effort that enables traits of faciality to subtract themselves from the imperialism of the face. A tic arrives out of the blue but is, at the same time, always controlled. That’s what characterizes a tic, otherwise it wouldn’t be a tic. It’s always controlled by the face that recomposes itself. There are some admirable tics. Specialists of tics give them a bad rap. But it’s good to have tics… though not too many. And then… there’s no time to go into it more.\n\nSo, we were saying that there are traits of faciality, that the face guides us in binary choices, as linguists call them. This is very useful for power since binary choices are actually orders. To make a mistake in a binary choice, to mistake a v for a p, what does this mean? It means being a bad pupil… and why? Mistaking a v for a p, or 100 for 10, none of this is information, it’s the transmission of orders – both at a social level and at that of the most obvious power assemblages.\n\nSo, the question I can’t manage to figure out is: we would have a more flexible and precise hinge between power assemblages and faciality if we managed to show how and why the face has a fundamental rapport with binary choices: that is to say, how and why the face instigates dichotomies in every direction. You are a man or you’re a woman, you’re rich or you’re poor. Look at your face! You’re a woman. Why do you dress like a man? But you’re poor, look at you! And you expect to have the right to come in here. Here… a poor guy like you. Rich, poor, boy, girl. You’ll tell me that it’s not just a question of the face. But yes! In certain power assemblages, in certain semiotics, it’s the face that will function, it’s the face that will be in charge of enunciating and assigning places. As though the face instigated dichotomies that are actual knots of arborescence. The face is a tree, the black hole is a tree, the wall is a tree. That’s it.\n\nBut in what way does the face create dichotomies? I don’t know… Guattari has understood this better than me, he’s gone farther on this point, and that pisses me off because there’s something I don’t fully understand, there’s something that escapes me. I completely understand binary choices, for example in language, and the role of the face with respect to the binary choices of language, and I know there wouldn’t even be language if a machine of faciality didn’t connect to the axis of signifiance. But here there’s something that escapes me, I don’t get it… In what way does the face dichotomize everything? And why does it do so? It’s not enough to say: “Because we have two eyes, two nostrils.” Please tell us… I can’t figure it out, I’m blocked.\n\nGuattari: I don’t know whether this is the right context…\n\nDeleuze: So, forget about it. Let’s speak about something else. We can discuss this next time…\n\nGuattari: I’m sorry… I’ve got a bit of a cold. I just want to say a couple of things for the moment. The question is to know how, in its most general form, a machine of faciality contributes to establishing what I call capitalist flows, what in Anti-Oedipus we called decoded flows. Decoded flows, because they can exist outside of “capitalist” societies, while also menacing primitive societies. I wasn’t planning to intervene during your presentation. It’s a bit annoying because I’m introducing some ideas that we’ve not already discussed together. I need to explain them to myself before I can explain them to others.\n\nAnyway, in what I would call territorialized assemblages of enunciation — for example, “primitive” societies, or a group of children and so on – faciality doesn’t have the same function. It doesn’t function as a reference of a place, as Gilles said, around which the point of arborescence of the ensemble of coordinates, or of the world, is organized. In societies typified by capitalist flows the face is a bit like… as they tell you at primary school, the support polygon with its centre of gravity. The face is a kind of polygon of all the coordinates, with a centre of gravity in the form of a black hole around which everything is organized.\n\nThis support polygon of general coordinates in a territorialized assemblage of enunciation is the territory itself. The territories and the most territorialized semiotics had to be deterritorialized in order to produce a face and a landscape, to constitute a facialization and a landscapification, as Gilles said last time – these are the result of this operation of deterritorialization. And this is accompanied by a general semiotic collapse. Meaning that all the semiotic components – gestural, ritual, corporeal, whatever you can imagine – no longer operate on their own account but must always refer to the point of arborescence.\n\nIn primitive societies too, people referred to a point of arborescence. However, this wasn’t centred on the face but on the territory. So, there was a translatability, a redundancy, a comprehension of all these components in relation to a territory, whether it be through a tree, a ritual, a sorcerer or whatever… What was outside the territory was considered an outland, a non-world, something that implied a negotiation and an exit from the territory. With the advent of the faciality machine, we will no longer have a rupture marking “our” world, “our” territory – where corporeal traits are inscribed among the other elements – for example Native Americans who paint their faces form part of a landscape ensemble. It is neither face nor landscape, but part of the ensemble of the territory. Here, we have a double operation. On one hand you have a concentration of the elements of signifying redundancy on the face around the black holes of the eyes. On the other, you have a universalization of the ensemble of territories. Hence, it is presumed that nothing escapes comprehension through the face. A face is always the centre of signifying coordinates. And, what’s more, the territory is vast. We tend to say: it’s France, the world, white people, civilized people, normal people, men and so on. It’s clear that all this constitutes a fascistic conception of universality. The signifying coordinates impose a very specific type of world.\n\nHere I’m speaking quite generally. How do we get to the problem Gilles has posed? If I manage to get there… it’s that when you look at a face… We introduced the idea of a four-eyed machine. The four-eyed machine consists in looking not at the eyes but at a point determined by the symmetry of the eyes. If you give me a moment, I’d like to tell you a dream I had so you can understand me better. One day, I dreamt about a woman who was looking at me. It was in a crowded space. Suddenly, I was captured by what I would say was her gaze – not her eyes. Then, I noticed that the way this woman was looking at me was quite bizarre. I was completely fascinated. And, suddenly, there was a flash. A very strange thing… a third eye appeared, very big, in the middle of her forehead that centered the two eyes. We can say that the black hole is not an eye in particular but rather the operation of symmetrization of all values, which permits there to be a central point for the organization of the coordinates.\n\nTo return, if you will, to the system of alternatives, a face functions like a kind of oscillograph establishing what is allowed and what is forbidden. There are always standard deviations around which a face oscillates. You can smile but not too much because if it turns into a grimace, you must be mad, delinquent, stoned or whatever. The ensemble of corporeal attitudes themselves, other semiotics continues to exist. We’re not saying there is just the face. But these are captured by the arborescence of the face. They’re recorded on a central computer, on the central oscillograph, which tells us what they’re supposed to mean.\n\nDeleuze: Actually, clothes are a facialization of the body…\n\nGuattari: Like make-up and what have you… Starting from this point, we are in a better position to understand the operation of binary either/or systems. In territorialized assemblages of enunciation, what I will call “the possible” — what it’s possible to do, possible to say, in whatever register, marriage, ritual, play etc. — is framed, organized according to a territory. If one leaves this territory, if something foreign appears, it requires a whole semiotic effort, a process of semiotization to be able to interpret and reframe this within the frame of the possible. If you leave your territory, there’s a whole series of steps you have to take because you’re entering a world in which the possible is no longer framed. For example, a cow dying is a strange event that we will try to frame within the possible – had it become rabid and in what conditions, whether this was caused by a certain act — then we reintroduce the event of the death of the cow within the new frame of the possible.\n\nIn the other figure of the individuation of enunciation, or the power of faciality, the whole of the possible is already framed, nothing can escape the double articulation, or the signifying rupture – to employ an old expression we’re not too fond of – that the face performs. In fact, in a primitive society, we have the feeling that what occurs in terms of inscription upon the face takes place upon the territory. Outside, are the others. But in these others, there is space for a whole possible world to open up. Nowadays when a white person looks at a black person, or an Algerian, they don’t situate them in another territoriality but in a racist movement as a “non-other”. Fascist or racist universality wants all people to be adult, white, normal, heterosexual, phallocratic and so on. And you see this immediately, you see it on the face, you see it from whether he got it, was he crazy, etc.\n\nSo, the aggregate of the possible – he has a strange face, a weird complexion, he’s a suspicious guy… — is attributed and centrally coded on the machine of facialization. At the same time, [Pause] the machine where there were not yet faces and landscapes, where there were territorialized rhizomes within territorialized assemblages, had only a local ambition and left a great degree of liberty to the other components of expression. With the machine of faciality, all components of expression become unified and depend upon a single expressive substance. So no matter what comes up can be seized and divided by this machine of faciality. Nothing can escape the universal white power of the normal face.\n\nNow what is this dichotomizing operation that takes place for example in informatics, when a message is decomposed into “bits” of information? It’s the fact that we can take the whole message and cut it a first time, so as to obtain a first division of bits, then a second time, obtaining a further division and so on. This will give us the formula of the quantity of bits corresponding to the number of divisions performed in the message. Thus, the ensemble of what arises can, on one hand, be unified, flattened on the white wall, while on the other, it can be divided up.\n\nWhat accounts for the power of this division? What is it that permits anything to be divided up in this way whatsoever? If I pronounce judgement on the face of someone who belongs to my tribe, it’s possible since they are part of my framing of the possible. But a primitive tribesman would never say that the other’s is a “foreign” face. It’s not even a face for him. It might be an animal, an intensity, or something else. It’s not his business.\n\nThe principle of faciality on the other hand always gives one the possibility of dividing any enunciation or anything that presents itself. It’s like the TV news. No matter what happens, even if it’s the most extraordinary event, the presenter will always be able to say, and will always say: “But none of this is surprising to us… We knew it was going to happen”. If the Martians landed tomorrow, “oh yes, that’s not at all surprising”, because there is always the possibility of reframing it within the signifying message’s capture.\n\nTherefore, the fact that a face is always interposed, and that it’s always able to divide and give a vertical and horizontal axis, a weight to enunciations, means that we see the world, we see the enunciations only in relation to this position of the face. The face can insert itself everywhere. And this is what allows this operation of potential dichotomization – not to mention the fact that all possibles are continually at the mercy of this system of divisions and there is no space for a rhizomatic “possible.” The possible is always subjected to a potential law of arborescence.\n\nA rhizomatic possibility existed in its territorialized form within territorialized assemblages of enunciation. A machinic, rhizomatic possible will appear when the face is undone. And at that point the divisions performed by faciality will refer to something very different from territories, which is to say machinic assemblages. Or, as Gilles was saying, there will be an end of the face, a becoming-imperceptible, where there will be a dissolution of both landscapes and faces. Because the face always implies a nationalism, a regionalism, a familialism, a space of redundancy, and where faces and landscapes will plug into a series of intensities that will no longer be reterritorialized but this time, caught up in machinic connections. I don’t know if this is clear…\n\nDeleuze: It works! [Deleuze smiles at Guattari] It works! [Deleuze breaks out laughing] … [Tape interrupted] [23:47]\n\nEric: I’m thinking about something…\n\nDeleuze: I remind you that for two years you mistook me for Derrida. [Laughter]\n\nEric: Now I’ll send it back to you! I’m for the forbidden garden! [Unclear words] I don’t know …\n\nDeleuze: You’re always addressing someone else!\n\nEric: I’m calling to you from far off…\n\nAnother student: I’m on a mountain. I’m very cold…\n\nEric: Oh yeh? Then you’re in the wrong spot! [Laughter] Wait, in fact, you are very kind! Fine, I’m saying, your story about the face is a marvellous invention. But I’m not doing that… I want to raise a question regarding the film camera. It’s the Marxist question. It’s only matter, it’s movement, it’s the death-drive. So, what is the death-drive? It’s your famous holes and I’m really upset! Here nobody says anything about castration and that’s what I want to talk about. The borderlines, you understand? That’s where the main point lies. And I’ll speak in French… I would really like to speak French, but I can’t manage it. The French language is in a triangle. It produces Oedipus. It’s not for nothing that Lacan exists, right? Fine… [Tape interrupted] [24:55]\n\nAnother student:  Can I tell my story now? [Brouhaha des voix] … I’ve got the priority.\n\nEric: You think you can give information like that. You have to shout it out!\n\nThe student: Then I’ll shout it out, for fuck’s sake!\n\nEric: You have to fight!\n\nAn Iranian student: Iranian students, in protest at the Shah’s latest crime – the execution of 19 revolutionary militants in Iran in the last few days, and last night there were others – have occupied the seat of the Iranian Government’s press agency in Paris. Following the occupation, the students were just about to leave the premises when the police burst in and arrested around twenty of our comrades. Giscard’s government has signed trade agreements with the Shah’s regime. Three billion francs worth last year alone. Farah Diba, the Shah’s wife, at the moment of the executions… Moreover,\n\nDeleuze: Sorry, can I interrupt you a minute. We began our seminar exactly on this point. There is conflicting information… Some of us wish to be present at the trial, which begins in a short while. I was told it will take place at 1.30 pm in Courtroom 23. Is that right, 1.30, Room 23? Is it at 1.00 or 1.30?\n\nA student: All the trials start at 1, but that doesn’t mean we’ll manage to get in.\n\nDeleuze: Yes, but we have to be there on time so we can at least try to get in. We have to go at 1 o’clock, it’s very important. We have to hurry.\n\nThe Iranian student: Can I continue reading now?\n\nDeleuze: Yes, of course.\n\n[The Iranian student continues reading, sound inaudible] … all the fascists…. And the revolutionaries are defending the military from the regime.\n\nAnother student: We can’t defend the military!\n\nThe Iranian student: I mean, defending Iranian militants against the Shah’s regime and his accomplices, the Giscard government. The militants will appear today, February 3, after being arraigned on January 28, before the Paris Correctional Court. Last piece of news: following a hunger strike, our comrades asked that the prison authorities feed them, and the prison guards responded by systematic sabotage, a regime of pyjamas only in cold cells. We ask for your active support in the liberation of our student comrades from the French authorities. So, there are also some final details: according to the law, they risk from one to five years of prison or direct deportation to Iran – which means certain death as soon as they arrive. So your support is of the utmost importance in this trial.\n\nDeleuze: Besides what they’ve already suffered at the hands of the French police before detention.\n\nThe Iranian student: People are asking if there’s going to be a meeting.\n\nDeleuze: There’s a meeting at six here in Vincennes. But it’s very important that anyone who wants to go to the trial goes, even if they don’t manage to actually enter the room, so that at least there will be a lot of people around the room at the Palais de Justice.\n\nSo, I’ll see you all next Tuesday. But if I understand properly, nobody knows whether there’s going to be a holiday or not…\n\nA student: We’ll find out tomorrow.\n\nDeleuze: We’ll find out tomorrow?\n\nA student: There’s a general assembly tomorrow.\n\nAnother student: Apparently there’s a philosophy meeting.\n\nDeleuze: The holidays are from the 9th to the 15th aren’t they?\n\nA woman student: We’re not sure yet… [Various voices] … [End of the session] [29:15]\n\n"

Stivale\n\n[Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions. We should also note that according to Deleuze at the start, the topic of the previous discussion, the close-up, needs to be reviewed and revised; however, as Deleuze mentions below, the discussion occurred between him and several students after the session, hence we have no access to the details]\n\n[29:16, start; 2:23:06, end of YouTube recording, total length, 1:53:50; see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Po2tIgeD4]\n\nDeleuze: We’ve now begun a fourth grouping of research. But we’re going to suspend it for the moment, though not for long, not for the entire lesson… I’d like to suspend it because something didn’t work last time, so we need to do a collective auto-critique – personal auto-critique is a bad idea but collective auto-critique can be useful. We all agreed that it was just about time to close the chapter of faciality, that we had spoken enough about the matter. But perhaps we should be able to get something more out of the close-up in cinema.\n\nAnd then I had the feeling – that I imagine many of you shared – that while many interesting things were said, we had failed to get anywhere. Something wasn’t right. And it was just as well to go on because things might have become clear all of a sudden, though it was by no means certain… I’m sure I’m not the only one but I had the feeling that something wasn’t working. And I asked myself why that was. How come we didn’t manage to get anything out of the close-up? Seeing as how that was the case… even if we were well placed… what I mean to say is that what we have to be wary of, always and in every field, are specialists.\n\nSpecialists are a really horrible thing, because they know so much, they know too much, and they’re so caught up in problems already coded in function of their speciality that, if you pose a question to a specialist, you’ll discover to your astonishment that there’s absolutely no chance of them giving you an answer. We could have asked someone from the cinema department, or else a critic. But in my view, it was better to avoid doing so. However, we were well placed to do something, whatever that might have been.\n\nSo why didn’t it work last time? I think that it’s because, even if it was interesting, what many of us said was linked to some kind of reminiscence: “Ah, I remember, I remember…” – and in a certain sense those memories weren’t completely out of place – “I remember there was a close-up…” It’s interesting, because I said to myself afterwards, our method – or the method that you accept or pretend to accept, me too – this rhizome method could have as its motto: “I hate memories. Nothing good comes of memories. Memories are actually a knot of arborescence.” But at the same time, how can we speak about the close-up without referring to specific films, which is to say filmic memories?\n\nNonetheless, I think that we failed somehow, because we got stuck in an exchange of memories, like old fools. So, we weren’t being specialists – which was a good thing – but we replaced specialism with a conversation of the type: “Ah yes, that film…” At the same time, of course, we have to cite particular films if we want to talk about the close-up.\n\nI don’t know… I would just like to ask you for the next half hour, before going back to our new research topic on the two types of delirium, to forget what wasn’t working. Although at the same time I found everything you said quite interesting. But as I said, something didn’t work. In exchange, I would like it if somebody, maybe in a week or a fortnight’s time, told me that I got it completely wrong… I’ll just say, on behalf of us all, that we screwed up a bit, not much, nothing serious. We could very well say that, even if the situation were different, we would have screwed up anyway, or that maybe our ideas will be clearer next year. Anyway, let’s try something.\n\nWhat I propose we do is almost… I have some topics… but I’m not at all sure… and then I would like you to react and propose things yourselves. And then we’ll stop there. And if things don’t work out again, it’s no big deal, we can just say that maybe this year it’s too soon to speak about the close-up.\n\nWe just need a few basic notions of cinema so as not make any howling errors. It’s not my case, of course. But perhaps there are some here who don’t know anything. And we just need a few memories, just enough to say: “Ah yes in that film, there was something of that nature.” You could go and rewatch it. Yes, but in any case… So here is my first proposal. And sorry if I seem… no forget it, I don’t need to apologize.\n\nFirst proposal: as a theorem, a general proposition regarding the close-up as I found it… because I was so unhappy… though I liked some things that were said… I wasn’t happy with the way we failed to really get anywhere. So I did some research. And I’m sure that you know this great director, who boasted about having literally created Marlene Dietrich from nothing, and perhaps worse than nothing – and it’s with great bitterness that he says that – this director called Josef Von Sternberg.\n\nJosef Von Sternberg published a memoir, which is translated in French as Souvenirs d’un montreur d’ombres (Fun in a Chinese Laundry) with Laffont. [Pause] [Deleuze returns to von Sternberg’s cinema in Cinema seminar 1, notably sessions 8, 9 and 15, winter/spring 1982; he refers to this Sternberg text in Cinema I: The Movement-Image, p. 231, note 10]\n\nAnd here we are, in this book, I found a lovely passage that seems to me perfect for our purposes. Because considering where we are, and all that we have said so far about the face, this text completely confirms our theory of the machine of faciality to the point that we could say: “We can take it as our general proposition regarding the close-up.”\n\nAnd I quote, it’s page 342-343… “The camera has been used to explore the human figure and to concentrate upon its face as being its most precious essence.” This works for us, there’s no need to comment on it. We have tried to say the same thing using other terms. We wouldn’t have said “its most precious essence” but that’s okay.\n\n“Monstrously enlarged as it is on the screen, the human face should be treated like a landscape.” It’s getting better and better! So, for Sternberg, the close-up contains not only what appeared to us to be a fundamental correlation – the correlation face-landscape – without which there wouldn’t be a close-up, exactly in the sense that we developed it previously. But also, the close-up consists in the very treatment of the face as a landscape. If you want to treat a face like a landscape – Sternberg seems to be saying here – you can only do it by using the close-up in cinema.\n\n“… the human face should be treated like a landscape, as if the eyes were lakes, the nose a hill, the cheeks broad meadows, the mouth a flower patch” — he’s obviously thinking about Marlene — “the forehead sky, and the hair clouds. Values must be altered as in an actual landscape by investing it with lights and shadows, controlled with gauze and graded filters and by domination of all that surrounds the face. Just as I spray trees with aluminum to give life to the absorbent green, just as the sky is filtered to graduate its glare, just as the camera is pointed to catch a reflection on the surface of a lake, even so the face and its framing values must be viewed objectively as if it were an inanimate surface. The skin should reflect and not blot the lights, and light must be used to caress, not flatten and wipe out that which it strikes.” \n\n“The skin should reflect…” So what Sternberg is telling us is that the close-up’s function is to treat the face like a landscape in conditions in which the surface of the face reflects the light. So, there we have the first major characteristic of the close-up. There are already so many observations we could make at this point, but let’s stifle them for the moment and try to put things in order. \n\nHe continues and here the text gets a bit bizarre: “If it is impossible to otherwise improve the quality of the face…” — here he’s speaking about the second aspect of the close-up, as a kind of alternative – if it’s impossible to do what he was talking about before, that is to say, transform the face into a landscape that is able to reflect the light, we see that he has a preference: he prefers the first aspect, but says that there is a second aspect, and I don’t see why other filmmakers might not prefer this… He says that if you can’t manage to attain the first solution, there are other approaches you can take… — Is there a dog here? I heard a dog? First of all, I hate dogs and secondly, I’m afraid of them. Is there really a dog? At least it’s better than a cat, that’s all I can say… —\n\n“If it is impossible to otherwise improve the quality of the face, deep shadows must add intelligence to the eyes, and should that not be enough then it is best to shroud the countenance in merciful darkness and have it take its place as an active pattern in the photographic scale. Before I allow light to strike a face, I light its background to fill the frame with light values, for included in its photographic impact is everything that is visible in the same frame. This principle of containing all values within a frame of values applies also to the human body and its movement through space is to be as a dramatic encounter with light. But whether face, body, a letter, a toy balloon or street, the problem is always the same: lifeless surfaces must be made responsive to light and over-brilliant and flaring surfaces reduced to order…”\n\nYou see the two aspects? Make light reflect through the face-landscape, or else if the surfaces are over-brilliant, attenuate and, if need be, darken it. Okay… If we decide to select this as our main proposition regarding the close-up, it’s obviously because it works for us. Here we find fully, [Pause] the close-up either makes the face reflect the light or else resorts to deep shadows, up to and including “merciful darkness.” So that suits us, since we find our white wall-black hole system. And if we might dare to correct Sternberg’s text, we could say that choosing the first aspect over the second is merely his own technical preference. We must recognize that there are also many directors who privilege the second aspect. \n\nSo, I ask myself, couldn’t we say the following… making some rapid comparisons? The screen is for sure, a white wall. The camera is for sure a black hole. So, couldn’t we say that there is a close-up when… – and here I’m moving towards a more abstract definition, but maybe it’s stupid, I don’t know – when the face tends to merge with the whole or part of the screen — which leads us to suppose that there are also partial close-ups that don’t occupy the entire screen; I’m pretty sure of this, but I don’t know, we’ll see… — when the face tends to merge with the whole or part of the screen considered as a white wall? So, it’s the face itself that functions as a white wall and is therefore identified with the whole or part of the screen. And similarly, when the face on the screen tends to be identified with or to function as the black hole of the camera. So here we have a first very general proposition regarding the close-up based on Sternberg’s meticulously precise text. \n\nSecond proposition: summing up quickly, I’d like to say that there are close-ups of things other than the face. In what conditions? We already have the answer, but we can verify it in the case of cinema since for the moment we’ve only considered faciality at a very general level. Naturally, we can have close-ups of all kinds of things. Though perhaps not everything… perhaps not just any old thing. \n\nWe can have close-ups of all kinds of things on the condition that the thing in question is caught up in a process of facialization. And this is the reason cinema is a modern art form and that the power of cinema requires the production of faciality, even if this faciality is abstract. I’m not saying that its production of faciality condemns cinema to a kind of realism or representation. We have already seen how facialization goes far beyond actual faces. However, in order for there to be a close-up on something other than the face, that thing has to undergo a process of facialization. \n\nAnd regarding this point I’ve been given a very nice text by Eisenstein, where he says, again in relation to Griffith of whom we’ve already spoken a little… Eisenstein’s text begins like this, speaking about Griffith’s close-ups [Deleuze cites this Eisenstein text in The Movement-Image, p. 91; this development on the close-up corresponds to chapter 6, “The Affection Image, Face and Close-up”]: \n\n“The kettle began it . . . Thus Dickens opens his Cricket on the Hearth. The kettle began it…”  So immediately there are new aspects to the question that emerge, when Dickens writes at the beginning of ‘The Cricket on the Hearth’… “The kettle began it.” Is he making a close-up here? Which leads us to ask: are there equivalents to the close-up before the cinema? Can we speak of an equivalent to the close-up in painting? Or in writing? And Eisenstein employs Dickens to comment upon all of Griffith’s close-ups. \n\nAnd he says: “What could be further from films! Trains, cowboys, chases… and ‘The Cricket on the Hearth’? The kettle began it! But, strange as it may seem, movies also were boiling in that kettle. From here, from Dickens, from the Victorian novel, stem the “first shoots of American film aesthetic, forever linked with the name of Griffith.” \n\nHere we would already have some guidelines, if we could show that in fact the novel typically performs processes of facialization that concern use objects, which in a certain sense it contains like a precursor to the cinema close-up – if it’s true that the close-up either concerns faciality or produces facialization. The close-up could be of a knife. We’ll see… or of a kettle. Provided that in a certain sense the kettle looks at me. There, the kettle is looking at me, not in the grotesque sense of having two eyes, or maybe also in this sense, why not – the black hole of the kettle spout. Not surprisingly, Griffith’s interiors always look at me. They look at me in the sense that I’m caught up in these interiors, they regard me. Even if it’s not my kettle, it’s someone’s kettle. At the same time, we can ask ourselves if there are things that resist the process of facialization. And here too our theory will be confirmed. We can say that something that resists the process of facialization cannot be the object of a close-up. \n\nSo, the last time we weren’t too happy with what we did regarding the close-up. And it’s by no means certain that we’ll be any happier today, it might not go any better. At the end of the lesson, a number of you stayed behind, and Mathieu Carrière told us about a text he remembered by André Bazin on animals, that now becomes very interesting for us. [In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari twice refer briefly, without reference, to “an unpublished study of Kleist by Mathieu Carrière” (p. 542, note 50; p. 553, note 11), regarding becoming-animal in Kleist]  It ‘s a text where Bazin explains how we cannot make a close-up of an animal. But there’s a problem with the text. Carrière lent me the book which I read but I didn’t see the same thing he saw in it. I don’t think Bazin said anything of the sort… and in a way I’m happy. Although it seemed like a nice idea, it’s even better if it’s not in the book. Or at least I didn’t find it. But let’s suppose he says that: We can’t make close-ups of animals. What does that mean? You’ll tell me, yes there are, there are plenty. \n\nThe answer we gave the other time at the end of the lesson was this: that if you make a close-up of an animal in cinema it’s a way of suppressing the animal, of facializing it, of attributing certain things to it and therefore introducing a dimension of anthropomorphism. We often see a big lion’s head. But the great animal films don’t include, or include very few, close-ups. Which doesn’t mean that there aren’t worse techniques. What normally replaces the close-up for animals, for example, is the use of slow motion. In Rossif’s last film there is a terrible use of slow motion in which the animal is no less destroyed than it would be by close-ups. It’s unbearable. The use of slow-motion applied to animals might work a little, but overusing it, that’s ridiculous. \n\nSo why would it be useful for us to say. “Okay… no close-ups of animals, it’s not possible.” As we have seen, the animal is defined by a certain state – which by no means implies that it lacks spirituality, however its spirituality involves a system where the head is strictly part of the body and therefore is not organized through a face that overcodes the body. On the contrary, the head is part of an entire corporeal code. So, there can’t be any close-up of the animal if it’s true that the close-up is either faciality or process of facialization. That suits us. But we would also need to demonstrate that each time we have a close-up of an object, as in the case of Griffith’s kettle, there is facialization. \n\nThird problem: The way to obtain – and here we might finally need a specialist who is able to tell us… no, it’s out of the question! – I ask, would it be inconvenient, and here I’m asking a question… would it be inconvenient to say that, as far as we’re concerned, we use the word close-up in a very general sense to account for effects that are produced by very different means? Because in the discussion that followed the last lesson, there was something that disturbed me. Among those who stayed behind, there were some who, if I’ve understood correctly, went as far as to suggest that the close-up doesn’t require or doesn’t necessarily require enlargement, that one could conceive of something that functioned as a close-up without any relative enlargement. I didn’t fully understand this… and then we stopped there. \n\nSo, as a way to orient ourselves a bit more clearly, might we not propose certain means, understanding that someone more competent in the matter might tell us: “no, this isn’t what we call a close-up”? All we know for the moment is that the close-up doesn’t necessarily imply immobility. A close-up can perfectly well be part of a tracking shot. Nor it does imply occupying the whole of the screen. For example, a face in close-up might occupy only one side of the screen. But doesn’t it imply a relative enlargement with respect to the other elements in the shot? I would say: yes, it does, but this is obviously just a question of means, it doesn’t help us to define its function. But I recall some of you saying that it doesn’t necessarily imply enlargement. \n\nLet’s try to imagine some different means. The first, the most famous, for which the word close-up is normally reserved refers to a mobile camera approaching a character or object. Another means is the reverse procedure. And the reverse procedure is, I think, frequently employed by the expressionists…. [Tape interrupted] [1:00:18]\n\nThe close-up considered as a scale of intensity has a completely different function. It implies introducing in the two-dimensional space of the screen something which is not reducible to two dimensions but which in this case is no longer time but intensity. Basically speaking, this allows us to say that the close-up has nothing to do with either depth of field or perspective. The question of how to add a third dimension to the two dimensions is a completely different one. The same goes for painting: if we find close-ups in painting, they shouldn’t be confused with problems of perspective. Otherwise, we’ll get everything mixed up. \n\nAnd Eisenstein talks about his own intensive close-ups. Except that there’s something bizarre – I don’t know if it’s the English translation or the political constraints to which Eisenstein was subjected — Eisenstein says: my intensive close-up is a signifying close-up, it’s a close-up that has a meaning whereas Griffith’s close-ups are purely descriptive. It’s funny the way Eisenstein defends himself, as though he were talking to Stalin or Zhdanov, when he says: “I haven’t forgotten, I’m not simply showing things, I mean something by them, I haven’t forgotten the imperatives of the Party!”, whereas in actual fact one would have to say the opposite. If there’s a signifying close-up it’s that of Griffith, in its anticipatory values, whereas the close-up as scale of intensity is absolutely non-signifying, a-signifying. \n\nAnd Eisenstein proposes examples from his own films such as The Battleship Potemkin, where there is what he himself calls “the line of mounting despair” which passes through several faces. You see this has nothing to do with anticipation, it’s very different… The mounting suffering or rage that passes through numerous faces, whether simultaneous or successive, creates a scale of intensity on the screen but we have no idea what it concerns. It doesn’t signal something which is about to happen. Here the process of mounting intensity is completely immanent. Are soldiers going to appear who will fire into the crowd? Or will something else happen? It’s very different from the knife close-up [Pause; here Deleuze slips implicitly toward the example of Pabst’s Lulu] in which the close-up’s function is to anticipate what will happen. At this point we know that Lulu will die, she’ll die, and that nothing will prevent it. In the intensive close-up, there is a sort of interiorization of the intensive scale that leaves what is going to happen off-screen. \n\nSo, were we to accept these two functions of the close-up, I’m saying that would be fine for me; were there only these two, that would suit me fine because they would respond perfectly to our two types of faciality as we have distinguished them: the despotic face and the passional face. So that would work well. The passional face is essentially caught up in an intensive scale while the despotic face is anticipatory. On the despotic face I read my destiny: “I’m going to die.” \n\nBut let’s imagine that between these two functions of the close-up there are multiple combinations. And on that point, I’d like to conclude with a quotation from Lotte Eisner, who speaks about an extraordinary scene that unfortunately I have no memory of. I saw it just once in my life, as usual at midnight at the Cinematheque. It’s in Pabst’s film, Lulu. And you will immediately see how useful Eisner’s expressions are useful for us. \n\n“Many times, Pabst films Lulu’s features on a slant. Her face is so voluptuous that it seems almost deprived of individuality…” This works well for us. We’ve seen how individualization is an extremely secondary function of the face. It’s a distant consequence of facialization and faciality. And here I skipped a phrase because it didn’t really fit our needs. In fact, here she got it wrong, it’s obvious… To be honest what she actually writes is “Her face is so voluptuously animal.” What a clanger. This is false. Lulu is not… it’s completely stupid. Well, everyone makes mistakes… Especially as the next part shows that she’s not at all an animal. \n\nIn the scene with Jack, she’s inhuman which is completely different from being an animal: “In the scene with Jack the Ripper, this face, a smooth mirror-like disc slanting across the screen” – that’s much better… – “a smooth mirror-like disc slanting across the screen” – like a disc collapsed on the diagonal – “is shaded out…” – remember, that’s Sternberg’s second method – “the shining surface is toned down…” — that’s exactly the second type of close-up Sternberg describes – “that the camera seems to be looking down at some lunar landscape of which it discovers and in a way explains the curves.” \n\nAnd here I’m skipping another phrase where she gets it wrong: “Pabst just shows, at the edge of the screen…” — if I understand correctly, this is the edge of the screen following the slant. And what we have here is a partial close-up that doesn’t occupy the whole of the screen. So, he shows this lunar landscape from awry. — “Pabst just shows at the edge of the screen the chin and a fragment of cheek belonging…” — Oh, no, it was me who was wrong there, he’s on the other side of the screen — “belonging to the man next to her” – Jack the Ripper – and then she says: “with whom the audience automatically identifies.” Here she makes a personal and rather forced observation, employing an abject concept of “identification”, which is completely pointless… [Tape interrupted] [1:08:22]\n\nSo, we have everything we need. There are the two functions of the close-up. The anticipatory close-up: the knife. And the intensive close-up: the face of Lulu consumed, aged, falling apart, and Jack the Ripper walking towards her with what is in this case a reverse close-up of Jack the Ripper’s face which traverses a scale of intensity. Everything happens as though Lulu is the zero intensity. The zero intensity is the matrix. It’s negative, it’s not nothing. The zero intensity is the pure white wall. And with the black silhouette or the reverse close-up of Jack the Ripper’s face; there you have the other function of the close-up. The close-up as intensive scale is no longer the element of anticipation. What’s more, you have the two modalities of the close-up that respond more or less to Sternberg’s text. Which is to say: one in treating Lulu’s face as a landscape, which means making it reflect the light. Or contrariwise, attenuating over-brilliant surfaces by plunging them into merciful darkness. So, in this sense everything is here. \n\nTo conclude, here is the last proposition, which I’ve already mentioned: we would need to see to what extent the other arts have their own equivalents to the close-up. This would allow us to objectively define these equivalents in terms of both anticipatory-temporal and intensive values. In a text… And in my view, well why… we’d have to do some research, we’d perhaps have need to consider – I’m again speaking at random once again – both the novel and painting. You shouldn’t be surprised at my saying this. I’m regrouping some notions here. In all we have said so far regarding faciality and facialization, we have seen that painting had a fundamental role in its use of face-landscape complementarity and correlation. And that the courtly novel had a no less fundamental role in the white wall-black hole system of the face-landscape. \n\nSo perhaps we could… I don’t know whether I’ve already mentioned this but I’m going to go back to it. I’m thinking about some relatively modern painters. Irrespective of problems of perspective, which are of a completely different nature, I have the impression that often in what we call… when we have a still life that doesn’t occupy the whole of the canvas, but which intervenes in the painting, very often it is oddly facialized. We are at the level of the kettle that looks at me. \n\nThere’s a painter I really admire, Bonnard… If you look at Bonnard’s paintings, you’ll see that many of them are of his wife. There are many Bonnard paintings depicting his wife having breakfast. Bonnard’s cups are something extraordinary. There is a kind of facialization of the cup. And once again, everyone will grant me – here I feel a bit guilty — we’ve never used facialization in the sense of anthropomorphism. That doesn’t consist in attributing a human head to the cup. Facialization is an abstract function. Just as there is an abstract machine of faciality. Facialization doesn’t consist in transforming the cup into a man or woman but in making a white wall-black hole system. Or you even have dogs in Bonnard’s paintings, or cats, which are facialized in a quite bizarre way, and without a trace of anthropomorphism. I’m pretty sure of it. Or as Eisenstein wrote, we should take the example of Dickens, which is quite exemplary in literature. [Tape interrupted] [1:13:56]\n\n[After the interruption, a discussion in progress unfolds, concerning issues of classroom space in Deleuze’s seminar]\n\nA first student: If we ‘re going to go on working like this, fine, but I’m leaving, and I won’t concern myself with why… [Inaudible comment] [As this unnamed “first student” will lead most of the discussion, he will be designated as such below]\n\nSecond student: It’s been 6 months! What do you want us to do? It’s been like this for 6 months!\n\nThe first student: I’ve made some concrete proposals!\n\nSecond student: [Indistinct comment] … Wait! Will you let me speak?\n\nThird student: It’s more like three years that’s it’s been this way.\n\nSeveral students: [Indistinct comments]\n\nThe first student: You’re wasting your time. It would take only a couple of minutes to sort it out. [Deleuze is visible quietly listening] Well, my problem is for him to move his ass!\n\nSeveral students: [Indistinct comments]\n\nMathieu: If we remove the tables, 50 more people will come in and we’ll be back where we started.\n\nThe first student: Well precisely, that will create a problem, but maybe we might organize the space better than me, and at least 50 people have already left.\n\nDeleuze: Please, allow me to respond in my turn. I’m not in any hurry, but … [Pause] \n\nA student: This isn’t a criticism, eh? [Pause]\n\nDeleuze: Yes, I think everyone has something to say, but we’ve already discussed it a lot, but you’re right to come back to this and to raise the question again, but we have spoken a lot about it. [Pause] So, if no one… [Pause] he’s right about one thing. The whole class has something to say, I too would like to say something…\n\nThird student: But what cannot be denied is that most days this room is almost empty! There isn’t even a table normally. There are dozens of chairs stacked up. There really are some and in such a way that… [Indistinct comment]\n\nA student: You think you’re in South America? [Deleuze laughs]\n\nThird student: It’s true, that’s how it is… In that regard, we could at least organize it a bit better.\n\nSeveral students: [Indistinct comments]\n\nAnother student: But the more places there are, the more people there will be!\n\nAnother student: Yes, but that’s not a good reason.\n\nAnother student: Instead of going on about it, why don’t we turn the seats around? [Indistinct words] Then you can see!\n\nThe first student: Now I’ll play like [unclear word] seeing as you were talking about cinema. Your idea is completely stupid. [The student stand on a table and begins crossing the room going from one table to another] These are our working conditions. [Applause from some students] It really is cinema, it’s playing at [same unclear word] …\n\nAnother student: Why are you getting so worked up about it?\n\nThe first student: It’s three minutes I’ve been trying to get in here. \n\nAnother student: Me too!\n\nThe first student: Hey, you guys there in the corner, aren’t you getting worked up about it? [Pause] Hey, I don’t want a chair.\n\nAnother student: If a fire breaks out… [Indistinct comments] \n\nThe first student: If a fire breaks out, I’m dead. [Explosion of laughter and comments making fun of the student’s comment, general brouhaha; the first student begins walking back across the classroom on tables] What I did there at least is without risks. All of you would rush for the doors.\n\nAnother student: That’s not true. There’s also a window where I’d go. I’d prefer to break a leg!\n\nDeleuze: I’d die the first!\n\nThe first student: You’re right!\n\nAnother student: I know someone who has a different solution altogether. He doesn’t want to say it, over there, but he knows that by passing through the window, he can reach you over there.\n\nAnother student: Not anymore; it’s closed. Even today we couldn’t manage. The room’s full. The room’s full. [Pause] This has already occurred twice this semester. [Pause] \n\nThe first student: Instead of wasting our time arguing, we really could just push all the tables against the wall. There are three walls, three sides, which equate to as many as 100 places!\n\nAnother student: So that’s where we’ll really die! [General brouhaha]\n\nThe first student: So, what we have is exclusion, selection… Anyone who’s late can’t get in. In these conditions if there are 200 or even 3000 guys who want to get in, we’ll have to queue up like at the Opera, like the theatre. We come here at 7h30, and whoever isn’t here by 7h45 doesn’t get in. And if you don’t see Deleuze, he won’t get in himself because he’ll be stuck in the crowd. [Laughter]\n\nDeleuze: That’s my dream… [Pause, laughter] I just want to say something, because it’s my turn, to respond to you, my point of view independent of the room, seeing as how you’ve raised a question we’ve already discussed many times. In any case, there is something which I would say he’s absolutely right about: the tables crept back in very recently. Before, there weren’t any. Now we’ll move on to other questions but it’s true that these tables occupy a lot of space… It’s not normal for the conditions we have in this room that there are tables. Up until this week, you permitted me a small table because I need books, but it was really tiny. All those tables and this big one were not here… I think that the first to arrive at the lesson should be so kind as to remove the tables, if there are any. More generally…\n\nA student: But we need to keep two, one for the tape recorders. \n\nDeleuze: Yes, of course. But more in general, the problem of this room has already been presented. I’ve already said I don’t want a lecture theatre. And not at all for the reasons that you impute to me, meaning lack of space to breathe, even if I do have certain problems in that regard, but that’s not the reason. It’s because I believe, and please don’t laugh, that trying to do what we do here in a lecture theatre would radically change the nature of the work. And no matter how uncomfortable things are here, everyone is free to intervene, anyone can interrupt me to speak about something else — and here we have the perfect example — none of which would be possible in a lecture hall. Because if we go to a lecture hall, I’ll be attached to a microphone – here’ it’s even worse, I’m connected to lots of other things, and I can’t even move – but the lecture hall would change everything. Because I would be in the situation of a formal lecture [cours magistral]. Of course, you might say: “But what is it you’re doing here if its not lecturing?” That opens another question but, in my view, no! that’s not what I’m doing. And if according to me I’m not giving a lecture it’s partly thanks to this room, which I cling to more than practically anything else. \n\nIf you tell me that things are bad, especially for those who get here after a certain hour, that conditions are unbearable and yet we have to bear them for three or two and a half hours… please believe me that I’m not trying to be funny when I say: I’m perfectly aware of this. I know everyone feels more or less uncomfortable, starting with myself, and I assure you it’s no picnic. I remember the good old days when I had a small corridor where I could walk. I like speaking when I’m walking, that’s how ideas come to me… But that’s all over now. I know, I’m not stupid… I know conditions here are pretty unbearable. Still, they seem to me better than the conditions of a lecture hall for what we’re trying to do. And I know some of you are suffering more than others, but I also know that everyone, me included, is terribly uncomfortable in this room. \n\nI just want to say that I think there are advantages to it, and that a certain number of you here find it advantageous enough to want the situation to go on like this. So, I respond, without rancor, truly, or provocation, that if someone finds that the advantages this room offers – meaning the possibility of a certain kind of intervention, avoiding what would befall me in a lecture hall, avoiding the form of a lecture, all of that, being able to say anything at all… It’s clear that we wouldn’t have the same rapport in a lecture hall as we do in a room like this. Here the rapport passes by way of discomfort, but in a lecture hall, it would no doubt pass by way of a horrible embarrassment, even if we would be physically better off. Or even despair: “My God, we’ve ended up in a lecture hall!”, “Shit, what is this?” There are many different ways of being uncomfortable. I just want you to know, I insist that I don’t ignore the fact that the conditions for the people at the back are extreme.  \n\nHaving said that, I fully agree that there are some stop-gap measures we can take. Getting rid of the tables seems an obvious solution. Make sure that those of you who are late getting here can move freely. I can even stop, if someone needs to pass this way. I’m perfectly okay with that. But I cling to the conditions of this room for reasons linked to the nature of what we’re trying to do, which would completely change in a lecture hall. And quite simply, if someone says to me, you’re being selective, I would respond in the same way as Mathieu: if we create 50 more places here, there will be another 70 people who arrive and we won’t resolve anything that way. \n\nWe gave ourselves a relatively small room for a working environment, not at all out of masochism or because we like to be uncomfortable, but because, and I’ll say it once again, what I want to say and what others want to say can only pass by way of these bad conditions. I don’t see any way we can avoid that. If someone tells me that the working conditions here are so unbearable that they can’t stand them anymore, once again my answer, without the least provocation is: too bad it means we can’t work together. Too bad, in any case I’m staying here. And I would stay here even if it meant being alone. Which would be a dream! \n\nSorry if I answer you in this way, but I really don’t think you could say: “Thing would be the same in a lecture hall. We would be more comfortable, and you could do the same as you’re doing here”. I said it. Things are as bad for me here as they are for you. I know it’s not a good argument but I’m not here to take a break. \n\nThe last question you raised, and that we’ve already discussed, is that of cigarettes… They don’t solve anything, actually they make things worse. I’ve always said that if we reached a point when it’s better to ban cigarettes, I would deny myself this as long as it was possible. Obviously, if I had an asthma attack, that’s tough for me, and I would stop for the day. And I would ask you not to, but if you didn’t agree, I would just go out. It’s simple, it’s not hard to understand. \n\nAllowing or banning cigarettes from the room has to be a collective decision. So, it’s not up to me. Except when I have physical problems. Of course, anyone could have physical difficulties and say no, you have to stop. Or they could go out. Or we stop. Anyway, that’s what I wanted to say. But I insist on the fact that – I would almost like to strive to convince you, even if for me it’s clear – I assure you that if we go to a lecture hall everything will change. Everything. In the name of enhanced physical wellbeing, which I’m not even sure about – because lecture halls here are like coffins and they’re not so comfortable – everything would change including and especially the nature of what we’re doing here… [Tape interrupted] [1:26:46]\n\nThe first student: So, if I want to go over there, how do I go about it? I have to start the same rigmarole as before… [Reactions from others] Maybe that’s funny, but I’m no longer amused, I can tell you. For what I can understand the problem remains. You presented it fifteen minutes ago, and Deleuze gave his view. And there’s still a minimal density over there [on the far side of the classroom opposite him] and a dense population here [behind him near the door]. There’s still lots of smoke. There still are tables. This is perhaps a poor composition. I’m not trying to seize power; I believe what I said, these were some suggestions. You said: “even if I end up alone”; what causes me despair that that’s what might happen. I asked myself whether I should go or not. It would be ideal if you found yourself alone. Maybe only then would we really do something. The working conditions aren’t good, so if students say: “working conditions here are no good, we’ll go and do something else”, perhaps the situation would change. \n\nA student: What occurs in the general population, I think, [unclear words] about people’s motivations that you’re talking.\n\nThe first student: Ah no, you think I’m an idiot?\n\nAnother student: [Inaudible comments due to student voices]\n\nAnother student: You’ve got a seat; you enjoy the system. [Pause, laughter, brouhaha]\n\nThe first student: You’re the privileged and we’re the excluded. [Pause, brouhaha]\n\nAnother student: It’s thirteen and a half minutes now that we’ve been talking about chairs. I’ve counted them. Thirteen and a half minutes. I’ve counted them. [Pause, brouhaha] So where are we going with this? [Pause, brouhaha]\n\nAnother student: We can get rid of the tables if that’s the problem, but let’s not take two hours about it. [Pause, brouhaha]\n\nAnother student: It’s clear this lesson is over! [Pause, brouhaha] [Tape interrupted] [1:28:32]\n\nA new first student: What is this Vincennes mystique anyway? Can you explain it to me? Is it a new church?  I don’t know it.\n\nAnother student (softly): There is no Vincennes mystique.\n\nThe new first student: So what is this mystique?\n\nA woman student: There’s no mystique of Vincennes, there’s just the reality of Vincennes.\n\nThe new first student: So what is the reality of Vincennes? [Different voices, answer lost]\n\nDifferent voices: Aaaah! Aaaah!\n\nThe new first student: So you see? There’s the real problem. \n\nAnother woman student: You’re really [lost word]. You sat down in a chair a while ago.\n\nThe new first student: Why don’t you sit down? Take a seat.\n\nAnother student: So, in the morning, I like to sleep in. [Pause]\n\nDifferent students: Aaaah! Aaaah!\n\nAnother woman student: And what about us? You think we don’t? [Pause, different voices] [89:00]\n\nThe first student (from the beginning): I come here, and I want it to enjoy myself, not get all this hassle.\n\nThe new first student: There are those who like to sleep in get up at 6:30 to have a chair.\n\nAnother student: You get up early!\n\nThe new first student: There are those who get up at 6:30 just to remain standing.\n\nA woman student: It’s completely stupid what you’re saying. Is this a struggle for life? \n\nAnother student: Yes, yes, yes!\n\nThe new first student: No, come on! Don’t be so stupid! We don’t have more than 400 seats in this room. [He tries to continue but the woman student speaks over him]\n\nThe woman student: There is one single chair and 100 people who want it. Only one’s going to get it…\n\nThe new first student: When there are 400 people here, they’ll be piled up to the ceiling. [Pause] Is what I am saying right or not? [Pause] So you see, that’s the way it is.\n\nThe woman student: I don’t follow your logic.\n\nThe new first student: What a shame. [Laughter, applause; Deleuze is visible laughing and smoking]\n\nAnother student: We have to divide the space into… [Indistinct comments]\n\nAnother student (near the microphone): Can I please have a cigarette?\n\nThe woman student: And the workers who get here late, what do they do?\n\nThe new first student: In any case, I agree with Deleuze… let’s stay here! [General laughter]\n\nAnother student: There are people standing who don’t say anything! [Laughter continues, including Deleuze]\n\nA woman student: Can’t we all move a little bit over towards the window there, so this can all be done? [Pause] So can everyone…  Can’t we move a little bit to the left? Can’t we try to squeeze up a bit. So, we can get this over with. Stop being stupid. \n\nA student: [Inaudible response]\n\nThe same woman student: There are still another 50 people outside the door. So, let’s squeeze up! [Pause, different voices, inaudible]\n\nAnother student: We can swap places! Those who are now sitting can stand. [Pause, different voices]\n\nDeleuze: Yes, well…  I remind you that one thing is true about what you’ve been saying, Before, the tables weren’t there. [Pause] So until now… [Pause, someone makes a comment to Deleuze] No, non, but if possible next time… [Pause], this is the first time, it’s the first time the tables have reappeared.\n\nA student: It’s sabotage! [Pause]\n\nDeleuze: Yes, this is a sabotage of the classroom. Maybe it was you who put them there. [Laughter, pause] So, is there any way… [Pause] Right now, I think trying to get rid of the tables, that would really be a mess because… [Pause] Is there’s no way we can make a rotary movement that will allow us to …? [Pause]\n\nAnother student: We can break off for 5 minutes to move the tables outside! [Pause, different reactions]\n\nAnother student: Are you crazy? It’s already 12.10. To have everyone leave and then remove all the tables will take two hours! \n\nAnother student: We could put them…\n\nA woman student: Those who are seated could pass their chairs over… \n\nAnother student: Why don’t we have a 10-minute break?\n\nAnother student: It’s not possible!\n\nThe preceding student: Are we having a break or not?\n\nAnother student: Everyone has to go out now… [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nThe preceding student: Are we having a break or not?\n\nAnother student: The lesson finishes at 1. [Pause; Deleuze is seen silently reflecting]\n\nAnother student: There is no pause. We’re just not continuing.\n\nThe preceding student: Everyone goes home at 1. \n\nThe preceding student: But we’ve been arguing like this for half an hour already…\n\nAnother student: If we go out … [Pause] if we go out, it will take until next Wednesday to get back in! [Pause, diverse voices; a dog barking is vaguely audible]\n\nDeleuze: It’s all the dog’s fault! I told you… [Laughter and pause; tape interrupted] [1:33:11]\n\nA student: I’d like to ask Deleuze if, hypothetically, we could take out the chairs that are already there. There would be much more space. \n\nOther students: No, no, no….\n\nAnother student: No more on this topic; let’s talk about something else… [Pause; diverse voices]\n\nA woman student: [She is speaking to someone in a low voice, inaudibly, then] … if there are no chairs, it becomes a room like any other… [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nDeleuze: What? [Inaudible comments] \n\nA student: No, it’s the same thing. [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nAnother student: Let’s stay here!\n\nDeleuze: I think, at least in part, [Pause] following what you said… I am feeling things here; I can’t even think any more. I am feeling things, and I think: “My God! I feel worse and worse…” [Pause] So you arrive here [Deleuze indicates the first student who spoke at the start of this section of the discussion], and you say, “What is this? It’s my first time here, what is this? How awful we feel here! How awful you poor chumps must be feeling! What’s the matter with you? What is it with you that you want to feel like this?” So, someone says this, points this out, and I listen, and I tell myself: “That’s right, it’s true, we feel so bad…” [Pause] On the other hand – and in saying this, I’m not saying that you’re exaggerating – there are cases in which I’m sure that, even over there in that abominable corner [Deleuze indicates the area near the entrance where the first student is located], when things are working… [Pause] — I’m not saying for everyone, or for everyone at the same time – [Pause] we forget our discomfort, [Pause] we don’t think about it anymore. [Pause] Because, at that moment, things are really working well. We feel uncomfortable, but we forget about it… [Tape interrupted] [1:35:28] [On the video, a new title sequence appears, as if this were a different day, but the same session and the same discussion in progress continues]\n\nThe first student from the beginning: Simply it seems to me that… \n\nAnother student: … what’s more, they weren’t even listening; you have to start over… \n\nThe first student: I just want us all to be able to work in an egalitarian way, all of us seated in the same conditions. If it should happen that the group doesn’t agree that we should work in an egalitarian way, with everyone having a seat, and putting the tables against the wall so people can sit on top of them, if would only take 5 minutes to do that, instead of half an hour of arguments… if the group doesn’t agree to that, then I’m leaving. \n\nAnother student: So what do you do with all those who can’t get in when the others are all seated?\n\nThe first student: We’ll see about that later, that’s in the future!\n\nAnother student: The future has already been going on for years!\n\nThe first student: Let’s give the experiment a try, and then we’ll see!\n\nThe previous student: We’ve already tried it!\n\nDeleuze: Yes, once more, I am responding to your proposal, but only… \n\nThe previous student: We’ve been working without tables here for years, and people always end up standing in the back.\n\nAnother student: But there are more people this year, I think…\n\nAnother student: That’s not true; there have been as many student for the last two and a half years…\n\nThe previous student: Listen to me…\n\nThe previous student: … It depends on the period. When the weather is nice, there are fewer here.\n\nDeleuze: I would like to answer… Considering the hour, it is out of the question to try to remove the tables now. [Several students say, “Yes, yes”] As I said, it’s the first time the tables have resurfaced, and I insist on this point because… [Interruption, diverse voices]\n\nA student: It’s not a question of removing them… just of moving them out of the way!\n\nDeleuze: Yes, but even just moving them will take half an hour!\n\nAnother student: There’s not just this classroom, Deleuze’s class…\n\nAnother student: At 1 o’clock, there’s another class; at 4 o’clock, another class, and at 7 o’clock, there’s another class here, every day… [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nAnother student: Where do you want to put the tables?\n\nThe first student: I want to move them so we can sit on them! … [Tape interrupted] [1:37:30]\n\nDeleuze: This is what I propose we do. He made a suggestion and so here’s mine. I repeat, we won’t have the tables anymore just as we didn’t have them before. The tables will be gone, starting from the next lesson. It won’t be hard to get rid of them. If there’s a [Deleuze indicates the entrance or the hallway] there, a room where we can put them, those who need them for other lessons can go and get them there. Those who don’t want to remove the tables don’t have to do it. Those who want them gone can do it when they arrive and can put them either in the room next door or in the middle room. Starting from next time, no tables will be here except a small one for the books. There you have it… [Tape interrupted] [1:38:36]\n\nA student: It’s a question of adding some tables, not taking them away. \n\nAnother student: It’s not true because rats have no resentment against tables.\n\nThe first student from the beginning: I don’t give a shit. You can judge my level of resentment when I’m gone.\n\nAnother student: Speak simply!\n\nAnother student: You should be ashamed of yourself, listen, you’re not so important! [Laughter; pause, diverse voices]\n\nAnother student: What’s the reason… what’s stopping us from putting the tables against the wall? [Students groan at this question]\n\nThe first student: That’s what we were talking about earlier. Are you thick? This isn’t possible!\n\nDeleuze: The answer is quite simple, which is there’s 20 minutes. \n\nThe first student: That’s what I proposed! Aaaah!\n\nAnother student: We only have 20 minutes left. It’s not worth it.\n\nDeleuze: It’s true. There’s 20 minutes, and the time it would take is 20 minutes because… And where do you move the tables if these guys don’t go out first?\n\nThe first student: 20 minutes to push the tables against the wall?\n\nDeleuze: Obviously, because everyone would have to go out.\n\nAnother student: And in 20 minutes the lesson is over. It ends at 1. There’s a half an hour left. \n\nDeleuze: [Brief, indistinct remark]\n\nThe first student (answering someone’s question): So that we can sit on the table… [He continues, indistinct words]\n\nA woman student: If we have to take the tables out, let’s do it!\n\nThe first student: But we can do it now. Why wait until next week?\n\nAnother student: We just explained to you that there are other courses in the meantime.\n\nThe first student: Let’s leave the tables here and push them against the wall.\n\nA woman student: Don’t you want to talk about something else? [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nThe first student: But of course! Of course!\n\nAnother student: He’s a mystic… that guy. \n\nAnother student: No, he’s nice. \n\nAnother student: Oh, you’re a clever guy, a clever guy!\n\nThe first student: The question I raise is why is it such a problem for the group to move the tables…\n\nA woman student: Because it’s impossible!\n\nAnother student: What a mess!\n\nThe first student: If it was possible, we would have already done it. \n\nThe previous woman: It’s impossible! [Pause; diverse voices; Deleuze is visible, smoking, waiting]\n\nA student: How about we continue?\n\nAnother student: Continue what?\n\nThe student: What were we saying?\n\nDeleuze: Aaaah! [Pause] \n\nA student: It’s about delirium! [Silence in the classroom]\n\nDeleuze: Fine. [Pause, he continues smoking] Okay, so we can agree [Pause] to make the tables disappear for the next time. \n\nA student: Yes.\n\nAnother student: Yes, we’re agreed on that!\n\nDeleuze: Fine. Isn’t there some way for someone to slide over a little… [He makes gestures toward the crowded entrance] there, along the wall?\n\nA woman student: We can make a corridor. [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nA student: Of course, as long as they make the effort to move. [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nA student: But there’s space on those tables over there, or do you prefer to continue suffering? Either you can either grin and bear it in your corner or sit on those tables as has not yet occurred up to now. Because, you see, no one is going to move the tables.\n\nThe first student from the beginning: There’s a lot of space on the window ledge.\n\nThe preceding student: So that your ass will be in our faces! [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nThe first student: If they sit on those tables, those behind will have their noses squashed against their backs. So that won’t work on the tables, I agree. I’m fine with that.\n\nThe preceding student: So now it’s a question of the schedule. That’s it. Either we go now or we continue; if we continue, either you guys just grin and bear it, like that, voluntarily…\n\nAnother student: And shut your traps!\n\nThe preceding student: Or you park your carcasses on them [the tables]. For the moment, there’s no other solution, to do it voluntarily.\n\nThe woman student (near the first student): In any case, I don’t feel like sitting down, I don’t feel like doing anything now. I’m finding all this so delirious that …\n\nThe preceding student: Ok, we’ve understood. You’re disgusted. There’s only one thing left for you to do, that’s to get out!\n\nThe woman student: And you can stop being such a pain in the ass! Wait for me to make my own decision.\n\nAnother student: It’s always the same rigmarole. How is it that you’re in France and you … [Indistinct words] \n\nThe first student: You’re entirely correct. I’m a fascist pig! I just wanted to say it.\n\nThe preceding student: Ok, then, there you are!\n\nThe first student: Thank you. I was expecting that. That works for me. It took 22 minutes for it to come out. No, sorry, 32 minutes. [Pause, diverse voices] By the way, I really enjoy being a fascist!\n\nAnother student: But anyhow, [Deleuze is visible listening and smoking] there are people sitting and people standing.\n\nThe first student: How about that!\n\nThe preceding student: Normally one comes here alone, and now we’re not! [Pause] It’s interesting you can find all these comrades so quickly. [Pause] Don’t you think so? You’re all standing over there, and now you are standing there together, and you tell us you don’t have seat, and you say with such attitude.\n\nThe woman student: Ah, you’re being a pain in the ass!\n\nThe preceding student: Fine!\n\nAnother student (the one who suggested she leave): Time to go, darling…\n\nAnother student: And the same goes for you!\n\nThe preceding student: Why?\n\nThe other student: You ask why? Because your being such a pain in the ass.\n\nDeleuze: Oh… things are going badly. This is getting ruined. [Pause, diverse voices, then a silence]\n\nAnother student: Where do you see all these empty chairs since there aren’t any?\n\nThe first student: We would need 50 chairs to accommodate everybody. How is that possible? [Pause; diverse voices] Count them. Be realistic. Count them and see if there are 50… [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nAnother student: Oh my God! Not again!\n\nThe previous student: [Unclear words; subtitles: Shut up!]\n\nThe first student: How do you explain that you’re standing and I’m sitting? I think someone should find him a seat so see if it’s reasonable for him to sit, and if there is a reasonable solution left. [Indistinct words; pause] I’m just blowing smoke out of my ass… [Diverse voices]\n\nAnother student: If you are, then stop blowing it out your ass? \n\nAnother student: Go ahead, that’s ok! You’re unblocking yourself! [Laughter]\n\nThe first student: I came here to listen to Deleuze, but I didn’t imagine any of this.\n\nA previous student (who gave the woman student the choice to leave): And maybe that’s your problem. You came to listen, and you spoke up plenty. Since you came here to hear him. That’s your problem. You came to listen.\n\nAnother student: [Inaudible comment]\n\nThe previous student: There you go! It’s better already.\n\nThe first student: Hey guys, when you’ll get finished speaking about my problem! [Laughter, pause] I know what my problem is. I don’t need others to speak about it. Speak about your own problems. All you guys sitting down for the past half hour, don’t you have a problem?\n\nThe previous student: Not at all. \n\nThe first student: Not at all?\n\nThe previous student: We’re really fine!\n\nThe first student: Bravo! [He applauds]\n\nThe previous student: None at all!\n\nThe first student: Guys without problems! Bravo!\n\nThe previous student: Thank you, pal!\n\nThe first student: I’ve read things [He points toward Deleuze] about microfascism…\n\nThe previous student: It’s not enough to read about it, you have to live it…\n\nThe first student: … I’m making some connections now…\n\nThe previous student: Hey, fascist number two! \n\nThe first student: [Some lost words] … There’s something that’s missing here. [Pause, diverse voices] I myself prefer to understand and be aware and try to exclude microfascism… \n\nAnother student: That guy hasn’t understood anything!\n\nThe previous student: We’re sick of your infantile power! [Pause, diverse voices; the first student appears visibly annoyed]\n\nThe first student: What? What? You think you’re a responsible adult maybe? [Pause, diverse voices] What kind of power do you think you have? [Pause] Do you have a solution for the 50 guys who are still standing? You and you’re responsible power?\n\nThe previous student: We’re having a great laugh, and then talking… \n\nThe woman student (near the first student) Hey, that’s not fair! You’re all sitting, you having a laugh! [Pause as she smiles, diverse voices]\n\nThe previous student: [Indistinct comment]\n\nThe woman student: You have everything… how unfair! [Pause, diverse voices; she bends to listen to something the first student tells her]\n\nAnother student: Will you allow me to decide for myself? \n\nThe first student: You want to regale us with your problems? \n\nThe student: We’ve had it up to here with your problems!\n\nThe first student: My problem is also yours? On that I agree. [Pause, diverse voices] So the solution to solve everyone’s problems… is for me to leave.\n\nA woman student: No, no, stay. Stay! [Pause, diverse voices, laughter]\n\nThe first student: Are you only inviting me, or the others too? [He indicates the crowd behind him]\n\nDiverse voices: Everyone! Don’t go! Stay with us!\n\nThe first student: So, are you inviting just me or everyone? There’s 40 or 50 of us here. [Pause, diverse voices]\n\nAnother student: Are you acting as their spokesperson?\n\nAnother student: Stop that!\n\nThe first student: No, I speak only for myself. [Very long pause, diverse voices, laughter]\n\nDog: [Barking is heard, also much laughter; voices of students in discussions, more barking]\n\nA student: So, give him a chair! [Laughter]\n\nA woman student: We can’t manage to find it. [The pause continues, also the barking]\n\nA student: It was Deleuze who mentioned the dog.\n\nDeleuze: In any case, we must be precise: our lessons don’t lack variety. [Pause, laughter] So, there we are… I’d like to… The chairs, all at once the chairs became… [Pause, Deleuze does not finish the sentence] Everything’s fine for me, everything’s fine, I mean… In fact, I have a confession to make; I’m feeling a bit sickened. Two times we’ve had, we’ve really had a bit of internal variety during a lesson. The first times we spoke about the face… [Noise, laughter; Deleuze and everyone turns to Deleuze’s right to someone near the board, off camera]\n\nA student (near the board): The close-up…\n\nDeleuze: That’s right, the close-up. [Pause] And then when we spoke about the close-up, [Pause] And suddenly… — There’s this unbearable cur — and suddenly, these chairs have become, they’ve become a kind of proliferation: the fewer there were, the more… Well, that’s okay. So, I propose again what I was saying regarding the chairs, everyone will maintain the same discomfort, if you don’t mind, and I’ll speak again for another five minutes, and then I’m done for today. For the moment, we’ve finished with the close-up unless you have something else, and then we’ll consider it next time. We can still carry this [A sudden brief high-pitched microphone sound from the film team] incompleteness of the close-up with us. \n\nI want to end today, going back to the topic we touched upon the other day, which consisted in saying this: in the end, there are two types of delirium – no, it wasn’t at the end’ we started with this — aren’t there actually two forms of delirium in the classification that concern something fundamental, which is to say forms of delirium without…\n\nThe first student: We haven’t resolved the problem, so I’m going!\n\nDeleuze: Okay! [Pause; voices of students complaining about the student’s words]\n\nThe first student: This is the complicity of a group unable to resolve its problems…\n\nA woman student: No, really, listen… [Pause]\n\nThe first student: Ciao!\n\nDeleuze (Pause for a small coughing fit): Aaaah… And so…\n\nA student: The man without a face.\n\nDeleuze: It’s funny the way things happen, don’t you think? It’s funny… In this group of deliriums with no intellectual impairment, with no intellectual deficit, we identified two forms. And as we said, it wasn’t by chance that psychiatrists of the 19th century tried to confront this problem and in the end were poisoned by it… I’m speaking on one hand about the group of so-called paranoid delusions, delusions of interpretation, and on the other about the group referred to as grievance delusions or passional delusions. Next time we’ll look at some texts. [Let us note that the distinctions developed here appear in Deleuze’s “Two Regimes of Madness”, from which the collection of essays takes its title, Two Regimes of Madness. Texts and Interviews 1975-1995, ed. David Lapoujade, trans. Ames Hodges and Mike Taormina (2003; MIT/Semiotext(e), 2006), pp. 11-16. The text was first presented, with Guattari, at a conference in Milan in 1974, and then was published in the edited volume Psychanalyse et sémiotique, ed. Armando Verdiglione (Paris: 10-18, 1975). On the paranoiac-passional distinction, see also A Thousand Plateaus, plateau 5, “On Several Regimes of Signs”.]\n\nI’ll remind you that the difference, even in terms of the schema, consisted in this: the paranoid delirium or delirium of interpretation was constituted around a centre, a matrix, a dominant idea and proceeded by way of circular networks, seizing upon everything, the most heterogeneous elements, a bit of this, a bit of that… [Deleuze makes gestures left and right] the chairs, a guy passing by the window; it seizes upon everything, everywhere, everywhere…\n\nA student: The dog…\n\nDeleuze: The dog! [Laughter]\n\nA student: The man without a face…\n\nDeleuze: And all of that… [He makes a circular gesture] it all forms a kind of expanding circular irradiating network in which everything is captured. And paranoiacs… proceed in this way. And not only paranoiacs. \n\nOn the other hand, you have a completely different form of delirium. In this case it’s as if a little packet – and here I need to use the word “packet” — a little packet of signs starts to flow along a line and then arrives at the end of a first segment and begins another segment. And after the second a third… In this case we have, in a single sector, signs that flow on a segmented line waiting for the first segment to be completed before beginning the second. It’s a limited delirium, beginning from an isolated packet of signs that pour onto a segmented straight line. A succession of linear proceedings instead of an expanding, irradiating network. \n\nI know you’d like me to quote some examples at this point… but we’re not there yet. We’re not there yet. These are two very different figures. The passional is someone who has an extremely localized delirium, that doesn’t at all seize upon everything. And what’s more, they continue to be perfectly reasonable. There’s just one thing, a sign. In erotomania, which forms part of the passional delusions, there’s a sign that flows along its line and that has its history. After which the first proceeding comes to an end. And then a second proceeding begins. There might be a pause between the two. The passional remains calm, regains their strength and then starts over, and then it starts over. In this case, we have a linear schema. Are the two figures opposed or can they unite?  \n\nToday, I just want to say something more about these two figures. So, in the case of the first, the situation is quite simple: we have a kind of expanding spiral. Whereas in the second, we have a straight line segmented in one, two, three or four parts and so on. We began from delirium in general, and we discovered two types of delirium corresponding to these figures. But we could very well have taken up other matters, and that’s the point we reached the last time. We’re considering an historical figure: the Hebrew and the Pharaoh, the despot of Egypt, the Pharaoh and the history of the Jewish People. \n\nWhat does it mean? I suppose that in terms of the despotic formation, whether Egyptian or otherwise, we find a figure similar to that of paranoid delirium. That is: an idea-matrix, a center, beginning from which, through the conjunction of the most diverse, heterogeneous signs, a kind of expanding spiral is created with either concentric circles or veritable spires. Regarding the history of the Jewish People, we discover a succession of proceedings. \n\nOnce again, let’s recall the basics of our method: this obviously doesn’t mean that the despotic regime is paranoid and that the history of the Jewish People is passional. In our method, they mean something completely different. Perhaps it’s a good occasion to valorize what we have been saying from the beginning according to a rhizomatic method that implies a cartography. This means that in maps of delirium… if we make the map of a delirium, not the structure, the map of a delirium, keeping in mind all its coordinates, this can be partially, or more or less partially, superimposed on the map of a historical proceeding, all the while bearing in mind the latter’s own coordinates. Therefore, it’s not at all a method of reduction. \n\nI would just like to say at this point that next time, without the tables, we will try to frame all this in a more concrete manner, both in terms of delirium and of the history of the Jewish People. I would just ask… and it’s quite obvious that despotic-paranoid regimes with their double map paranoid delirium- despotic formation… it’s quite obvious that they proceed like this. Everyone can recognize a part of themselves in it, though we will have to furnish a lot of details. They proceed through this type of expansion, of circular irradiation, which captures signs of the most diverse nature in a continually expanding network. \n\nIn fact, if we look at the Old Testament, it’s striking what happens when the exodus from Egypt begins. We witness a succession of linear proceedings. Venturing into the desert, guided by Moses, there will be a succession of segments, linear proceedings marked by catastrophe. And each time he will remain sufficiently Jewish to recommence a new proceeding. And I’m happy that from the very first pages of the Old Testament we find Moses’ formula: proceeding or grievance, proceeding or grievance, punctuated by a number of segments. In the Old Testament, there are some interesting passages that will be important for us. But we would need to know Hebrew… it’s somebody who knew Hebrew who says this. And you feel it in the translation in the curious oscillation between plural and singular forms. \n\nHere’s an example: a passage from Exodus says more or less… sorry I don’t know it by heart… they crossed the desert and arrived at the mountains of… I don’t remember where. “There, Israel made camp.” Apparently, it’s a very common phrasing in the Old Testament. I think it’s interesting because it could be said – and I think this would work, we could make a whole list of similar phrasings. I use the plural: they crossed, they walked, they arrived. And there, Israel made camp: all of a sudden using the singular form. It’s as if this passage to the singular marked the end of a segment. And then a new segment began. \n\nWhat is this linear thing? I would like to continue with a point that will be of great importance, I think, for literature, psychiatry, politics, the more of a mix the better. If I tried to qualify in a negative sense – and for the moment allow me to use whatever words I use with caution – if I tried to qualify the two systems, I would first ask: what are they doing here, what is the evil of the first system – I say the evil – how do they spend their time in the despotic system or the paranoid delirium? In a certain sense, if we were really trying to describe what they do, the best word would be: they cheat. They pass their time cheating, duping. \n\nWhy do they deceive and cheat? It’s well known that the interpreter or the diviner spends his time duping and maneuvering the face of god. From ancient times, mobile masks and statues were maneuvered by priests, they had mobile statues so that the voice of god would appear to issue from one of the channels and so on… they cheat, they deceive. What’s more, in the irradiating circular system, to go back to that, one passes the time jumping from one circle to another. I’ll try to explain why we’re in one circle and then jump into another. There is a whole system of trickery and imposture. After all, the man of State is a deceiver, an impostor, not in any pejorative sense. I mean, you understand this is connected to what we are saying. We don’t wish to treat anyone as an impostor. We could care less about that. Rather, we want to arrive at a definition of deception. \n\nThere’s a book by Borges with an admirable title, A Universal History of Infamy. But when you read it, you can’t help but be disappointed because the book is terrible, completely worthless, I’m convinced of that. He completely blew it. You expect prodigious stories of universal infamy. What might those be? Someone should rewrite it, rewrite the whole book… Or at least try. Because on the other side, if we take our schema of linear successions, linear proceedings – we begin with one segment, we continue with another segment, etc. — what happens? There’s a completely new figure. We will have to see if it is the something new that arises. In attempting to use some words, I would say we’re no longer in the field of deception. It’s about a completely different field: it’s the field of betrayal. [Pause] So, we have two notions here: deception and betrayal. Deception is always an affair of State. But what about betrayal? Universal infamy concerns both deception and betrayal, but these are not at all the same. \n\nWhy am I speaking about betrayal? It’s one of the most fabulous themes of the Old Testament that I think has no equivalent. Take for example a character from Greek epic. Ulysses… it’s not hard to show that Ulysses is a great deceiver. And once again I use the word deceiver in a highly positive sense. The deceiver is perhaps the man of State. Take Shakespeare’s kings… We should reread Shakespeare’s great historical tragedies. They’re all deceivers. They all seize power by murdering someone – whether it be a brother, a brother-in-law or someone else – and then they say, that’s it. It stops here, we’re no longer going to kill anyone. From here on justice begins. And then they themselves are deceived. But in this process of the conquest of power through murder and the reestablishment of justice, there is a kind of fundamental deception. \n\nBut aren’t there also traitors, of a totally different nature? From the very beginning of the Old Testament, something surprising happens. Which is to say that God turns his face away both from one of his faithful and from his people. And in the same movement the figure varies: man or the people turn away from God, as in a kind of double turning away. It’s interesting… What’s happening here? \n\nLet’s take a first example, almost from the beginning: Cain. I summarize the story of Cain. It’s very short but I hope you will reread it: Abel and Cain each make a sacrifice to God. We shouldn’t forget that Cain is God’s favorite. His favorite. God has always preferred traitors. Why? In any case… the two brothers make their sacrifices and bring them to God. The text says that God accepts Abel’s sacrifice but is indifferent to Cain’s…  [Tape interrupted] [2:08:04]\n\n… Death indefinitely postponed. What does it mean? A slow death? No, not even slow death. Survival, life suspended following a linear proceeding. What does God say to Cain? Cain comes to him and says: “My crime is too great for me.” My crime is too great for me. And God replies: “But I shall not kill you. I shall even give you a mark such that no one dare kill you. You will be kept alive. You who are my betrayer. I who have betrayed you. And you who are my favorite.”  \n\nI speak of the prophet in opposition to the diviner. The prophet is an interesting figure. He is always someone who turns away from God. Which is to say that he is a traitor and is understood as such. The finest case, even if there are many, is one of the fundamental texts of the Old Testament: the story of Jonas. Usually, prophets have no wish to be prophets. God arrives and says: “This is what you’re going to do!” And immediately there is the turning away: “Oh no, no, no!” He turns his face away. The prophet is the one who turns away from God. “I run away from the face of Adonai. I run away from the face of Adonai.” \n\nI am saying that Jonas’s is the finest case because God arrives and tells him: “The city of Nineveh is in sin. They are all sinners. They live in abominable voluptuousness. Things can’t go like this. You’re going to save Nineveh.”  And Jonas says: “I can’t.” He turns away and what does he do? Here too you have to go back and read the text, which is short and rather wonderful. The beginning of Jonas is almost a great comic text. In the Old Testament, there are a lot of comic texts. And this is a great one. \n\nHe goes in exactly the opposite direction. He literally does a runner. He runs in the opposite direction to Nineveh. God sends him to Nineveh and instead he boards a ship to Tarshish, which is cardinally opposite. So, he flees, he traces his segment of flight. Eventually, God will catch him and there is a whole part of the story where he keeps him in suspension in the shelter of a little tree. In the text, it’s called the tree of Cain. The tree of Cain… a connection is forged with Cain. \n\nWe’ll see there are other examples, many other examples. But you will also see that Christ, the story of Christ, can be understood only through and in function of this long history of betrayal. Why have you abandoned me? Why have you abandoned me? Meaning that God turns away from Christ just as Christ turns away from God. And what happens in this double turning away? There’s a kind of long errancy, a suspension of life. \n\nThere’s a film I’m sure many of you have seen – perhaps betrayal has a long history — a wonderful film called Aguirre, Wrath of God. Aguirre is the story, in a completely different epoch — his story could be considered part of universal infamy – it’s the story of a traitor who wants to be the only traitor. He says: “No, I am the only traitor.” What does he mean by this? “You can have as many deceivers as you want but I am the only traitor.” \n\nIn the dramas – and not surprisingly the film is very Shakespearean — in Shakespeare’s historical dramas and those of his contemporaries, there’s always, or at least very often, a bizarre guy who appears denouncing all the deceivers and tricksters. And the deceivers and tricksters are always men of State or men of the Court. And there’s someone who says: “Instead of ending up like that, I will go further in my infamy. I will go further in my infamy. I will be the traitor.” And he opposes betrayal to deception. \n\nAnd Aguirre is exactly like that. If you recall, he sets off on a linear proceeding which will be one of betrayal. How is it possible to betray everything at the same time? That’s a good question. How is it possible to become the universal traitor? How do you betray everything, to found in the end a pure race with his imbecilic daughter? And you recall when he looks at one tall guy and says – it’s pure Shakespeare — “He is tall, he has an extra head. I’m the only traitor here!” and his aid understands and chops the guy’s head off. At every moment in the film the theme of betrayal is key. \n\nSo, I’m saying, Hölderlin wrote a book that is a, is really great, called “Notes on Oedipus” and “[Notes] on Antigone”, two short texts that have been translated, though I’m afraid they are out of print, in the paperback collection 10-18.  And he says something much more profound than what Hegel has to say about Oedipus. Hölderlin says something magnificent. He says that Oedipus is a modern tragedy, the only modern tragedy of the Greeks. Actually, in this he’s not saying anything exceptional. Even Malraux said something similar. He hadn’t yet honed it down, what he wanted to say precisely. But why does he say that it’s a modern tragedy? Because it’s the tragedy of slow or indefinitely postponed death. \n\nAnd in fact, usually when a Greek hero commits an act of hubris he is struck down, or condemned, by a god. That’s not the case of Oedipus. Oedipus is exactly like Cain. He’s a Greek Cain. Oedipus, following the part of the story we know well, doesn’t meet a violent end. He encounters a long linear proceeding, the line of flight along which he wanders, keeper of a secret. And Hölderlin defines Oedipus as the man he calls the double turning away or the categorical turning away. Hölderlin was a bit Kantian, not excessively so, but he remembered the Kantian expression we all learned in high school, the categorical imperative, which in Hölderlin’s words becomes the categorical turning away: when God turns his face away from man and vice versa. And that’s where betrayal begins. What did Oedipus betray? \n\nSo, I’m thinking about a text by Nietzsche: The Birth of Tragedy, paragraph 9, in which Nietzsche makes a very interesting observation which goes in a similar direction. He says that bizarrely enough the history of Oedipus is not really Greek. He says more or less that Oedipus is the most semitic of the Greek tragedies. Because there is a passion of Oedipus, a passivity of Oedipus. And he goes as far as to say that there is a femininity of Oedipus. \n\nAll I wanted to say today, to begin the analysis we shall develop next time, is that we will need both these two figures: the circular irradiating figure, whose complement is the face viewed head on, the signifying despotic face, violent death or expulsion. And the other system, that of successive linear proceedings where we have a completely different form. In the first figure we also have trickery and deceit, if you like, whereas in the second figure we have faces that turn away, passional faces, life suspended on the straight line, whether in the wandering of Oedipus or the flight of Cain. Here we have a double turning away that defines something like a system of betrayal. \n\nTo add to the mix, there’s a play by Shakespeare that doesn’t represent a king or a man of State who seizes power by deception. It presents something else that might pose certain problems for the mise en scene. A great tragedy: Richard III. Richard III, in spite of appearances, doesn’t care about the conquest of state power. That’s not what interests him. He’s not a deceiver, he’s a traitor, and the great scene of betrayal is at the same time a scene of complicity, as though the double turning away were complicity itself. It’s the scene between Richard III and Lady Anne. Lady Anne, who completely understands Richard III, is terrified by him and says to herself: “This man has exceeded all limits.” And she already consents to the destiny that awaits her. There is a face-to-face encounter between Richard III and Lady Anne, in which the two faces never cease turning away from each other. [On Hölderlin, Cain and Jonah, Oedipus, Nietzsche, and Richard III in this context, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 123-127]\n\nWe will have to ask if later the Reformation, in its return to the Old Testament, didn’t seize upon this figure of the double turning away, the universal betrayal. How much did Luther have to say about betrayal? You understand that an abstract proposition such as “good works cannot save you,” this is fundamentally linked to the theme of betrayal. Meaning: even our good works betray us, and we betray our works. \n\nSo, I say all this simply to reinforce the two forms we have studied, once again, on one hand, we risk encountering: signifying face, violent death or exile, and trickery and deceit; on the other, the face turning away; life or death indefinitely postponed; double turning away that determines a betrayal. \n\nI would be very happy if some of you could reread the stories of Cain and Jonas in the Old Testament. So, there we are. No more tables next time! [End of the recording] [2:23:06]\n\n"

Also note that the following session, titled “Il Senso in Meno 9,” belongs to the same session as this one, and we present it under Part 10]\n\n[2:23:07, start; 3:45:46, end, total, 1:22:39, of YouTube recording, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Po2tIgeD4]\n\nA student: … With the tables it was more like a buffet…\n\nDeleuze: Do you miss having the tables?\n\nThe student: [Unclear words] … Oh, no…\n\nDeleuze: It’s no longer the same, eh?\n\nAnother student: It’s more practical! [During these exchanges, the camera slowly pulls back revealing the participants, stopping at Guattari seated opposite Deleuze toward the back of the room]\n\nDeleuze: [Unclear words] … It’s not bad this way; it’s a bit like a waiting room. It’s not bad. [The camera returns to Deleuze] Okay, enough dreaming. To work right now. No more pauses. [Pause] So let’s get started! [Tape interrupted] [2:23:57]\n\nDeleuze: So, it’s good like this today… because I have to make some drawings… I have to make a few drawings because the last time I proposed a number of themes which were very disordered so you might reflect on them and so we might go about trying to organize them. So… at least we have chalk, but the blackboard is a bit dirty… [Tape interrupted] [2:24:32]\n\n[For what follows and the drawings that Deleuze develops, see A Thousand Plateaus, plateau 5 and specifically the drawing presented on pp. 135-137, the first one pertaining to “signifiance”; as the recording begins again, Deleuze stands at the board having already drawn a version of the initial illustration]\n\nStarting from what was said the last time – and we’ve spoken about it a little – let’s call this the schema of signifiance. And we can immediately say why we have called it the schema of signifiance. Let’s imagine that we can reduce it to a point… Here, perhaps, we have a centre of signifiance. And around it we have a number of concentric circles… concentric circles or spires, spires of a spiral. And on these spires, we can place any kind of sign.\n\nI want to go back to something that struck me during the last lesson. How did it begin? At the beginning, there was a dog barking at the back of the room. A dog where there shouldn’t have been a dog. So I’ll put it on the outermost circle: it barks, it’s a sign like any other. Or it would be a sign like any other… but in what conditions? If we were, for example, paranoiacs… The dog barks. He’s right to bark. And what happened afterwards? I was over there. I raised my head and suddenly I was afraid. This is an entirely different circle. I haven’t drawn enough of them. I saw someone masked, who was wearing a kind of S&M mask. I hadn’t noticed him before, [Deleuze makes a gesture toward the back of the class] I wasn’t expecting this. [Pause, he turns back to the board] A dog barks, a mask can emerge…\n\nI said to myself that I was going to need all this for later. I was thinking that here there was an atmosphere, a phenomenon of mundanization or atmospherization. I saw it and I wasn’t the only one. Something was going to happen. I didn’t know what. I didn’t know where it would come from. And then on another circle there… someone who arrives who makes a sign, who emits his own sign saying: “It’s the first time I come… what are all these tables doing here?” [Pause, laughter; Deleuze is referring to the circumstances that occurred in the previous session’s discussion]\n\nOn one hand, there is a redoubling: there’s a girl who appears to be taller than him because she’s standing on a table and for that reason she emerges. She makes a speech… which is at times quite violent… and I’m thinking: “Let’s take that route”. And at that point, the tables take on an enormous importance, and they park themselves on all the circles. The tables… And then I turn to see somebody entering the room through the window. That’s a whole other experience, different from the one with the dog. So, all I’m saying is: there is a center of signifiance — and we will see what this consists of – of numerous heterogeneous signs distributed across concentric circles or the spires of a spiral.\n\nAnd what else is there? Maybe, to complete the schema, there is something I’m drawing now with a broken line: a line of flight. At the top of the outermost spiral is a line of flight. There may be different ones: those who leave because they’re fed up. The door is more or less blocked. So you pass by the window, I don’t know how… But I’ll draw this broken line of flight, and there I have my first schema.\n\nYou will, I hope, recognize the point where we began, namely, the schema of “a something”, and I am indeed saying of a something because we need to ask ourselves what this “something” is. There’s “a something” that is defined through a kind of matrix or center which produces a sort of circular irradiation, an expanding circularity accompanied by a broken line of flight. So, beginning with this type of matrix, an expanding development occurs, which summons to itself, or regroups or redistributes along its spires signs of a most diverse and heterogeneous nature.\n\nAnd then we had another schema. [Pause; Deleuze starts working on a second schema on the board] In this case it was no longer a schema of signifiance. We called it a passional schema, or a schema of subjectivation. And this schema is clearly very different from the previous one since, rather than proceeding from a center through an expanding circular irradiation, it proceeds from a point – a point of subjectivation rather than a center of signifiance. In fact, I might be able to subjectivize myself from any point of departure. A fetishist is subjectivized -and is therefore defined as passional – beginning from a pair of shoes or a single shoe or even just a heel. A lover can be subjectivized beginning from the eyes. We’ve already seen things of that sort, or maybe we haven’t, no matter.\n\nThis point of subjectivation is like the beginning of a straight line. And this straight line is segmentarized. What form does it take? It’s segmentarized through a certain number of successive proceedings. Remember how the two schemas were formally opposed – even before knowing to whom and to what all this referred, even if we’ve already looked at it? But we can put this aside for the moment…\n\nThe formal opposition of the two schemas consists in: irradiating circular expansion beginning from a centre that will distribute the most heterogeneous signs. And, in the second case, a small packet of determined signs fleeing along a straight line that is segmentarized in successive proceedings. So, we oppose the idea of a succession of linear proceedings to that of irradiating circularity. Just as we oppose the idea of a fleeing packet of signs beginning from a point of subjectivation to that of a group of heterogeneous signs subsumed by a center that organizes their distribution, expansion and irradiation.\n\nSo, I would just like to pose three questions, starting from these two schemas. First question. Supposing that here we have two semiotic schemas… for the moment, we still don’t know what a regime of semiotic signs consists in… we are using the words approximately… Suppose that what we have on one hand is a semiotic of signifiance and on the other a passional semiotic or a semiotic of subjectivation: can we make a connection between them, even just on an abstract plane? To be able to do so would be reassuring. Reassuring, because we could say that, in concrete terms, they are continually mixing. In concrete terms, our semiotics of these things are mixed. They borrow a group from a certain system or regime and from another regime.\n\nCan we link one of these schemas to the other? Clearly, we can. But only at a certain cost, and in certain conditions. I say “clearly we can” because this broken line [at the end of the first schema] is clearly the irradiating and circular system’s line of flight. Isn’t this line fully realized in the passional system? To the point that to link the two schemas, it would be enough to place this line [the straight line, second schema] right here [to the end of the first schema], [Pause] making the center of signifiance descend to this point which now becomes a point of subjectivation. It seems to me that that would work perfectly. I’m simply holding onto the possibility of linking the two schemas as if they were two little trains.\n\nSecond question: What do these two schemas refer to? That we already… Actually, it’s up to you, and this poses the problem of method that we touched upon at the beginning. I would say: they refer to whatever you like. Because each of these two schemas is a multiplicity, even if we talk about a center of signifiance, even if there is an instance of unification. In any case, such an instance functions within a multiplicity. So, we have a multiplicity of signifiance and a passional multiplicity, or multiplicity of subjectivation. Actually, I cannot say that one of these characteristics is more important than the other. They are all on the same plane. I can say that each of these multiplicities has n dimensions. We’ll see what dimensions we find. Here, for example, for the moment – and I insist on this point to convey how simple it is – for the moment, here… as I will try to explain… we have 7 dimensions. If someone tells me “I see 9…” or “Among your 7 some can be reduced…” it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it there is never a fixed number of dimensions. It proceeds by 2, by 3… There are 2, 3, n dimensions, whatever you want.\n\nHere too, I have to define my schema [the second one] through n dimensions. And this is what defines it. Which is why I don’t need to ask myself beforehand what it refers to. The question isn’t what it refers to; the question is: how many dimensions does this one have [the first schema] compared to the number of dimensions of the other? On this point, if I openly enumerate my dimensions, it doesn’t matter if someone comes along and says: “I would add one”. On the contrary, it’s even better. What’s more annoying is if someone arrives and says: “Here I would remove one or two”. But that’s okay too.\n\nWhen we have our number of dimensions, I suppose… it seems highly abstract but, in reality, it’s just a kind of recipe. It really is a recipe. We should write a cookery book! Let’s suppose it has two dimensions. For example, I take three. When I limit or else augment the number of dimensions, when I vary them, it’s only then that I can say what it is they refer to. Before that, it could be anything… a determined multiplicity but of whatever character, an unassignable multiplicity. If you take a precise number of dimensions, then you can ask what it refers to. So, let’s do that. What does this refer to?\n\nWe can call these dimensions the system’s coordinates. In function of the coordinates we take into consideration, we can attribute the schema to something specific. Today I can say all this in abstract terms because the other time, we looked at it concretely. In the schema of signifiance, if I consider certain dimensions, whether or not I state which these are, if I consider certain dimensions, I obtain this particular schema, this multiplicity which refers to a type of delirium. What is this type of delirium? We’ve already seen it: it’s the paranoid delusion and delusion of interpretation, or a delusion of ideas. Why is this?  — We’ve already looked at it and I don’t want to go back to that — Because this delusion is constituted upon a matrix idea, a center of signifiance; it proceeds by way of irradiating circular expansion, and reunites, sutures or distributes the most heterogeneous signs.\n\nIf I consider other coordinates, you will say: “Which others?” We will have to look at them in detail. But please grant me that if I take other coordinates into consideration, the multiplicity’s frame of reference will change. I would say this is important as a way to be able to avoid pointless objections. It will no longer be a paranoid or interpretive delusion, it will be a social formation, the type of formation we may call despotic. If I consider or privilege – because it isn’t simply a question of keeping or jettisoning but also of emphasizing a given dimension – if I consider another dimension of this system, this multiplicity, I would ask, based on the other dimensions, or on this one, is this a system? I mentioned this to you yesterday while trying… no, I mean last week, while trying out different terms, especially since these terms don’t come from Guattari or myself. It’s an idea someone proposed, that someone suggested to us. — And that’s the way to proceed: if people give you ideas, at some point, you’ll give them back in return. — Someone suggested to us certain noticeable differences between the two systems as a function of particular dimensions. I would say that this multiplicity can be called the system or multiplicity of deception.\n\nWhy does one spend one’s time deceiving in this system? It’s not so clear cut. I said some things last week that we will have to go back to and try to develop further. I call that common work when, for example, on Monday I make this multiplicity the multiplicity of paranoid delusion. And we say, okay, you hold onto that. I make the multiplicity of despotic power. And then another person, man or woman, arrives and says: “I’ll make the system of deception out of it…” So, you understand that it wasn’t a schema after all, but a map, a map, a map of variable coordinates. You could turn it upside down, refer it to a particular coordinate, and then it becomes delirium. You could refer it to other coordinates, and it becomes instead a social formation. You could refer it to further sets of coordinates, and it became something of the order of deception and trickery. [Pause] There you are. Each of us can do the same for the other coordinate.\n\nAnd we saw that for other one, it was the same: the same method applied. You should never ask at the beginning to whom or what something refers to. Establish your own multiplicity! Calculate it well or badly… and for each case it must be different. Don’t do as Hegel does. Don’t proceed 3 by 3. Don’t proceed 2 by 2. Open yourself to all numbers! Say: if it’s 7, then let it be 7. If 90 then 90. And in this sense, it’s also by following the dimensions you take into account that you assign the multiplicity to this or that.\n\nAnd we’ve seen how the multiplicity of passion-subjectivation could have been assigned – depending on the dimensions taken into consideration – to a type of delirium. You see clearly how I’m already lying and playing tricks with everything because, in fact, in a real method, this shouldn’t be same now. I wouldn’t have the right to find two sides, two forms of delirium. Nor would I have the right to find two sides in terms of two social formations. Except that, if I proceed in another way, we would be lost. It would be too difficult for you as it would be for us all. So we approximate, but it goes without saying that all this serves simply to cause the collapse of the pseudo-unity of delirium just like the pseudo-unity of social formations.\n\nSo, we have to pass by way of this point. Therefore, if you consider certain dimensions of the second schema, you will extract a form of delirium, passional delusion or delusion of action, [Pause] and they are not the same thing. I won’t spend much time on this because I’ve already developed it extensively… I just remind you that passional delirium, which is always opposed to, or assumes another figure with respect to paranoid or interpretive delirium, has been given different names throughout the history of psychiatry – all of which more or less refer to Esquirol’s notion of monomania. The monomanias that Esquirol divided into three types: erotic monomania or erotomania, incendiary monomania…\n\nA student: That’s a good one!\n\nDeleuze: It’s not bad, not bad… and then homicidal monomania, reasoning monomania. Not bad… They more or less equate to what others would call sticklers. People who stick to procedures. A kind procedural delusion. And Esquirol had already defined monomania as a different form of delusion, not from paranoia, because he didn’t yet know the word, but from mania. There wasn’t an ensemble of things that undermined the exercise of faculties that otherwise remained sane, but a succession of acts, a delusion not of ideas but of acts. [On Esquirol, see the Foucault seminar, session 3 (5 November 1985), and on psychiatry of the era, see A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 119-120] And this, particularly in Germany, was called a querulous delusion. And this is where the legal procedural aspect came in. It was a delusion of querulants. They start a proceeding that arrives at its conclusion and then they embark upon a second and then a third and so on… Other psychiatrists would call them grievance delusions. And yet others would refer to them as passional delusions. And they were grouped into three main forms: jealousy, erotomania and redress.\n\nSo if you consider certain coordinates of the second multiplicity you will have, for example, a delirious formation: the group of passional delusions. While if you consider other or more coordinates, you will have – it’s what we touched upon, perhaps rather hurriedly, and it will still have to be proved — you will have something quite strange, no longer the despotic formation but something quite different we will have to find a name for this but maybe we will just look for a general name. Since we’re talking about attributions and without seeking to be too symmetrical, we could call it the history of the Jewish People. [Pause]\n\nBut to what extent? Quite generally, since we tried to get an idea of this the last time, and naturally the history of the Jewish People raises a number of other questions. It’s not by chance; I’m really glad that I first made the connection, the Jewish people with the exodus literally going off on a tangent from a despotic system, the system of the Pharaohs. [Pause] Everything happens as if they took upon their shoulders, and inserted themselves into, the line of flight…  [Tape interrupted] [2:53:50]\n\n[While several details seem to suggest that what follows occurs in an entirely different session – Deleuze now wearing a dark coat (that he removes at the end of this section) and a hat – the following 36 minutes is the result of an interruption in the work in progress, with the same schemas on the board evident in the subsequent part. Since this segment opens in mid-discussion, it is important to explain the substance of the debate which is revealed only gradually. Apparently during a break in the filming, a woman student made some unclear accusation to Deleuze concerning a “stolen text”, and Deleuze stated his refusal to continue and even threatened to leave, hence the coat and hat. Following this unrecorded part, the debate unfolds on two tracks, on one hand, on what basis could or should the assembled class members exclude the student in question, and on the other hand, if the material that Deleuze developed earlier – concerning despotic power, etc. – might prevent any such move. As the session opens, a student (designated here as “the first student”) is speaking on behalf of the second position]\n\nA first student: … first of all, you can’t eliminate, for example, the despotic system. It’s there. One has to admit that. You can’t get rid of it. It’s not that we don’t want to, it’s that we can’t do so…\n\nA woman student: What are you trying to … [Indistinct comments]\n\nAnother student: Wait your turn, darling!\n\nThe woman student: [Unclear remarks, pause] … It’s not true what you’re saying.\n\nAnother student: Shut up! [Diverse noises, pause; the first student is visibly waiting]\n\nThe first student: I’m not saying that we don’t want to do it [presumably, exclude the woman student in question]; it’s that we can’t; we can’t because the mode of repressive power is impossible to… it’s everywhere. It can’t work, it’s unfeasible. I mean, that here, in this theatre where we are, we … there are…\n\nAnother student: But we’re not in a theater! We’re not in a theater!\n\nThe first student: We cannot…\n\nThe previous student: [Indistinct comment]\n\nThe first student: It’s truly impossible! How can it be done? [Diverse voices, including the first woman student’s] What would we have to eliminate? By what means… [Indistinct comment]\n\nAnother student [Philippe]: I have a proposal to make. In my view, we’re all being cowards. I’m doing something I’ve never done before in my life, and I take responsibility for it. I’m throwing you out! [Pause] I’ve never done anything like this in my life. [He starts walking towards the students standing near the door; diverse voices, noises] What you’re doing is completely unacceptable.\n\nThe first student: No it’s not, I’m saying…\n\nThe second student (Philippe]: I’ve never done this before.\n\nAnother woman student: You don’t have the right to do that.\n\nThe second student [Philippe]: Otherwise, every Tuesday, we’re the ones who are getting thrown out. Do you want it to be the same every day? And just because we’re trying not to be repressive, so everyone lets themselves get aggressed. For us, that makes us… [Indistinct comment; diverse voices; Deleuze becomes visible in his usual seat, wearing a hat]\n\nGuattari: Philippe! Oh! Philippe! [Diverse noises, voices]\n\nEric: Nobody is taking responsibility in this classroom!\n\nGuattari: Philippe! Listen to me a second!\n\nDeleuze: Philippe, don’t touch her! Don’t touch her!\n\nA woman student: He has to calm down!\n\nGuattari: He is calm. He has the same right to be as sane as you.\n\nThe first student: The problem is that this is nonetheless an interesting place to be. Even if it gets upset, even when it’s upset, there is an effect created, and here we produce a perfect outcome. It really is an extraordinary example.\n\nAnother student: It’s making a straight line on the circle. [Reference to Deleuze’s two schema’s earlier]\n\nThe first student: Before, we were discussing it but now we’re no longer doing so. We’re just suffering it. What’s at stake is something completely different. It’s not a question of analysis. It’s about what we’re living, you understand? It’s an unimaginable mode; I mean that there isn’t a problem of exclusion. We can’t exclude anyone.\n\nGuattari: Giovanni Jervis talks about these things on the radio all the time. They discuss boring stuff like the situation in Italy, and then there’s someone talking about an amazing thing, like all these marvelous things that Éric mentions even if they’re seemingly off topic. So, you’re saying we’re condemned to cut off any intervention like that, just to have a bit of logical coherence. Jervis has spoken about this problem. What is this “tolerance” of ours towards certain forms of discourse, where we can spend an entire lesson arguing with someone? It’s possible, it can be done… it would be great to be able to spend a couple of hours talking to Eric and his woman friend who must be dying of anguish right now. Fine.\n\nBut since our goal is to speak with a certain logical coherence about a series of connected ideas, we can’t accept it. We are prisoners of a certain representation of “spontaneism”, of a certain freedom of expression, a kind of absence of constraints that comes back to assault us… as though we were walking towards the riot police carrying bunches of flowers as they attack us. It’s completely stupid when you think about it…\n\nA student: We’ve had it up to here with therapy!\n\nGuattari: Therapy? It’s not a question of therapy. If we say: “One day we’re going to clear things up with our friend here, what happened with Deleuze? What occurred? Why did she talk about stolen texts?” Yes, okay, fine. We’ll come to an agreement there. But if we accept that anyone can walk in here and throw boiling oil on us, pile on a load of crap with all that stuff, we can’t function at all   anymore anywhere, we’re prisoners. Unlike Philippe, I don’t think we can find a solution by crucifying ourselves with violence. But we have to confront the problem. We are ourselves… we secrete this reaction. We lay ourselves open to this reaction.\n\nThe first student: Does one have to say about what you just said that…\n\nEric (interrupting, screaming throughout his interventions): You’re making an analysis of the institution. You’re describing how it functions. And on that point, we’d do better to reread… uh, [Bronislaw] Malinowski…\n\nGuattari: Malinowski or [Vladimir] Mayakovsky?\n\nEric: You embody the institution as a professor!\n\nA student: [Inaudible comment due to the screaming]\n\nEric: Deleuze…. [To the student] That’s not the question… I’m trying to say something, idiot! There’s always… I’m speaking to her… there’s always a difference between what I say and what I live. And at Vincennes, there is always a difference between what we say and what we live.\n\nGuattari: Eric, Eric!\n\nEric: And this is what I call contradiction!\n\nGuattari: Eric, do you want Deleuze to leave Vincennes for good?\n\nEric: No!\n\nGuattari: That’s what you want!\n\nEric: No it’s not!\n\nGuattari: So why are you behaving constantly like an idiot?\n\nEric: [Indistinct comment at start] … I’m saying that you embody the institution!\n\nGuattari: You’re going to succeed. That’s what’s going to happen. Is that what you want?\n\nEric: No, I have nothing to do with this business.\n\nGuattari: Yes, you do, because you’re creating a shit storm (tu fous de la merde).\n\nEric: No, I’m not! [Tape interrupted] [2:59:15]\n\n… Guattari: So can we continue now?\n\nThe first student: Yes, well, but I can’t accept this. I mean, I can’t accept that we go on analyzing a model in this way. We can’t build a discourse on this model, saying: “Let’s analyze it and see what we find,” all that. No, … [He tries to speak while Guattari answers]\n\nGuattari: Then we won’t do anything. There’ll be nothing to do either next week or the following week. So it’s now that we must decide. [Silence, pause]\n\nThe first student: I mean that…\n\nGuattari: I’m not talking about Deleuze. He can say what he wants, but I can’t go on like this.\n\nThe first student: It’s not possible! Anyway, the proof is right there, that there are lines everywhere, everyone’s always arguing all the time, no one is getting along, we can’t understand anything about anything. And that explains everything.\n\nAnother student: That’s not true! I understand perfectly well.\n\nThe first student: No, we don’t understand anything…\n\nAnother student (Robert Albouker): I don’t give a shit about what he says. That doesn’t interest me at all, at all, at all. And you know why? It’s because [indistinct words] I am quite pleased, but all the [indistinct words] in this matter doesn’t interest me.\n\nA student: If we raise the question of exclusion, we have to understand how it happens, if there are any rules.\n\nAnother student (Robert Albouker): There are no rules. That’s why we’re all here…\n\nThe first student: There aren’t any. That’s just the point. There aren’t. And if there aren’t, what are we supposed to do? And here I’m following all the lines. We’ll never get out of it.\n\nA woman student: No, no, I don’t see that.\n\nAnother student (Robert Albouker):  Of course we will. We do it every morning, that functions every day, every single goddamned day, like fools, at work, at school. It works. And we even have to smile about it.\n\nAnother student: Oh, no, no, no…\n\nThe preceding student (Robert Albouker): What do you mean “no”? Look at me, I’m here!\n\nThe first student: At the Elysée asylum, that works as well…\n\nThe second student (Philippe): I propose we vote… Does the course continue as is, that is, next week or does it not continue? We have to take responsibility and decide once and for all whether to exclude this girl who’s been disrupting the lesson and who will continue to do so every Tuesday until we’re left with nothing, we have to accept our responsibility!\n\nA woman student (whose voice and protests are audible in the preceding student’s statement): No, that’s not true! [Pause, diverse voices, all indistinct]\n\nThe first student: We have Deleuze here, and this question concerns Deleuze and her before it concerns us, that is, there’s something going on there [he makes a gesture linking Deleuze and a woman student]. It’s not at all… I mean, even if we vote, Deleuze can always say, “No, she ‘s here, she makes it impossible for me,” I don’t know. [Deleuze sits listening in silence] If he can work it out with her, I don’t know… it’s something between Deleuze and her.\n\nThe second student (Philippe): No, it’s not just between Deleuze and her. It concerns all of us and her.\n\nThe first student: Not at all! Not at all!\n\nGuattari: We’re reaching a level of idiocy now that’s unbelievable! [Diverse voices, brouhaha] We’ve descended to the state of stupid cattle, [Pause, reactions] stupid cattle pulling wagons into the camps. [Pause]\n\nDeleuze: I would just like to say a couple of things now… I awake from my catatonic state, and I would say…\n\nA woman student: But Guattari already…\n\nSeveral students: Shut up!\n\nDeleuze: [3:02:17] I’m asking two questions. Firstly, what are we doing here? We are quite modest. So what are we doing here that is of so bizarre in nature that it triggers a certain type of aggression? [Pause] We’ve seen a lot of examples. Today’s is one that seems particularly painful. Second question: what is it that makes us – and maybe with some reasons, though I won’t say these are good reasons – what it is that makes us so defenseless when confronted with these acts of aggression? In a sense, it can be useful to learn something from the outside. What we’re doing here must not disturb anywhere; I don’t know, I’m not saying “anyone”. But suddenly we are disarmed in the sense that it becomes very easy for a single person to create havoc in the classroom, considering that the balance of power normally favors the individual, unless he or she happens to be in a classroom with a whole army, a security team available.\n\nPersonally speaking, I feel a bit lost today. And it interests me so little that I can say my only strength – and here I’m not speaking on behalf of the rest of the class – my only strength is an extreme obstinacy. Three Tuesdays would be sufficient to accomplish a very simple thing: completely destroy the work we’ve done. I’ll come back every Tuesday. I don’t give a shit; I don’t give a shit. [Je m’en fous]\n\nThere are two elements that come together in this affair. This girl arrives. She has a certain relationship with all of us in that she prevents us from doing what we’re trying to do. And as you said, she obviously has a certain rapport with me. Of which I understand nothing. I only know — and this is no secret because the same problem has occurred in other situations — I get calls at night when I would normally be sleeping. Silence on the other end of the line, or insults or obscenities… Usually very confused. They always mistake me for someone else.\n\nIt’s very similar in a way. In the case of the phone calls, as Félix says, what should we do when people like that are so obstinate? They call you ten, twenty times in a row. I pick up the phone, and I hear noises. What should we do? One day, we might even find someone on our doorstep, standing there saying “I want to see you!” What do we do then. Call the police? Don’t call the police? What do you do after three months of this? It’s strange how it always happens to the same people. Lacan is lucky in this sense. He would have resolved the problem in two seconds.\n\nBut in my view, it’s a kind of strength, nothing exceptional, but it’s a strength that we are so, so… even if now we might be forced to change tack… though not much. What is it that makes us so defenseless faced with someone who comes in here saying: “You stole that from me!”? The same way I’m defenseless when they call me up at night. What is it that produces this? I would almost say, at the risk of sounding vain, I would almost say that it’s the novelty… a certain novelty in what we’re doing. It’s a certain novelty in what we’re doing here that permits someone to turn up…\n\nI think of a recent book that I find quite repellent where they refer to us as “the current trend”. The current trend… That’s a bit exaggerated because — and I stress that Lacan has nothing to do with it — but it’s a bunch of Lacanians, Lacanian Marxists, as Eric would say, who speak of us as “the current trend.” But to be frank… if there is an organized “current trend”, it’s not us. We are nothing. We just work in our little corner.\n\nOnce again, what can we summon by way of response if they want to prevent us from working? I’d like to imagine some responses we could give. I would say it’s partly the nature of what we are doing here that renders us so defenseless, and yet at the same time, I consider this a means of defense. Therefore, I’m not going to leave. I was wrong to say that I would leave… I’m not going. I’ll just wait until you leave. That’s all. And then if this goes on much longer, and you stay, then probably I will end up leaving. There we are. [Pause] But I think the only way to resist is to stay on the defensive when facing cases like this. Perhaps we ought to find a better solution, we might find a better solution, but for the moment I can’t think of one. So, now I slide back into my catatonic state…\n\nA student: I think she left! [Pause]\n\nAnother student: Actually, she left ten minutes before all this [unclear word; then to Deleuze] You hadn’t seen her face before? [Pause, Deleuze makes no response] What makes you think you didn’t start all this? I’m not accusing you.\n\nDeleuze: Ah yes!\n\nThe student: I’m not accusing you, ok? [Pause]\n\nDeleuze: I’m afraid of myself!\n\nAnother student: I’ve never saw her face at all… [Pause, several comments from other students]\n\nDeleuze: Oh yes, she was here last year. [Pause] Has she gone? [Deleuze stands up]\n\nAnother student: Well, yes she has.\n\nDeleuze: Really? [Pause, laughter; Deleuze slowly takes off the hat and coat he has worn throughout the discussion, that he no doubt put on when he was planning to leave; noises of chairs while he prepares] … [Tape interrupted] [3:10:02]\n\n… Deleuze: One can always speak through dualisms. In the end, it’s the easiest, the most convenient way. Once again, the base 2 binary system is the most convenient. Parenthetically, that’s what computer scientists are always telling us. Computer scientists, who always work through binarisms, say they do it because, from the computer’s point of view, it’s the easiest method. For a computer, we know, base 2 is the easiest way. [Pause] So much the better, we say, since considering what we have done up to now, in the way we’ve considered the question, we’ve learned something.\n\nWhen we spoke about the face, we thought we’d discovered that binarisms, the establishing of dichotomies and binary rapports, the whole aggregate of dualisms, had served us well for reasons that were far from mere convenience. They were connected to the exercise of a certain type of power, and there were forms of power that couldn’t tolerate the polyvocality of bodies and had to produce face, and that in producing face, established major binarisms, given that the face is caught up in binary relationships. And beginning from this, the signifying elements were distributed according to a series of dichotomies.\n\nWe also saw how an exercise of power is something that completely defines the dominant language and that profoundly defines the way that language and words are used. As a result, it’s not a question of saying: “I will invent a language without dualisms.” There’s only one thing at stake here: not only are dualisms convenient but language itself as a form of expression of a particular power imposes dualisms. As a result, our only response, both in speaking and writing, is to continually open a kind of passage between dualisms. And each time we make a dualism collapse – a dualism is like a piece of furniture, it’s something that is always being moved around… – we’re inevitably going to run into another one and so we’ll have to open up a new passage in that dualism. And each time we’ll try to do so.\n\nAs a result, of course I am saying there are two forms of delirium on each side. It goes without saying that we will try to open up a passageway between these two forms, we will try to arrive at something that will obviously no longer deserve to be called either reason or delirium, nor one type of delusion or another. However, we’re not going to be able to open this passageway using a predetermined method and every time we will have to regain the multiplicities, passing by way of these dualisms.\n\nSo as I can only respond like that, I am saying, let’s try to look for the dimensions, the coordinates of the first system that we call signifiance and which, based on the coordinates contained therein, will be located both at the level of a delirium and of a social formation, a system, for example, a system of deception.\n\nSo the first coordinate — I number them because there are many and this will help us to orient ourselves — the first coordinate, to return to my example of signs, which in the meantime has become more complex as we have added others, is a system in which a sign refers to other signs ad infinitum. There’s a whole network of signs that are completely heterogeneous. [Pause] Everything is captured.\n\nWhat does it mean when we say that a sign refers to another sign? After all this emotion, we have to let loose… The sign refers to another sign. It means at least that some things can no longer happen. When a sign refers to another sign of which I know nothing in advance, a kind of atmosphere has already been born, an atmospherization, as I said before. What do we understand here? The sign refers to another sign. I should say that in our method we should never practice free association of ideas. What we have to do is produce redundancy. We have to make resonate not words but bits of phrases [Pause] until a kind of jump occurs. The sign refers to another sign. We feel that we’re not going to get anything worthwhile out of that. We can say, yes it’s true but it leaves us in an impasse… No matter what sign refers to no matter what sign. This is the system of signifiance. Nothing to be gleaned there, we’re saying.\n\nThen suddenly a glimmer of light appears. If the sign refers to another sign, it means at least that it doesn’t refer to something else. And what would this something else be? I can conceive… maybe it will help us get out of these dualisms. I can conceive of a sign that refers to something other than another sign. A sign can refer to a state of things. An extremely variable state of things. For example, smoke is a sign of fire. Of course, fire could be just another sign, and then we fall back into the same trap. But fire can also be considered a state of things.\n\n“A sign refers to a state of things” is a very different proposition to “a sign refers to another sign.” A painting, a corporeal painting on the body of a member of a tribe, appears to refer to a very particular state of things. It’s a code that refers to a territoriality. Are all states of things of this nature? Animals, it’s well known that animals emit signs. For example, excrement, which equates to states of things, is often used by animals as signs. Signs of what? Signs of the limits of their territory. The sign may therefore refer to a state of things that, generally speaking — I don’t have time right now to ask whether or not every state of things is a territoriality — but I’ll just say that a sign can refer to a state of things that can, generally speaking, be reduced to a territoriality. [Pause]\n\nBut I see something else. The sign may also no longer refer to a state of things that it designates. It may refer to a signified, as they say, to something that it signifies and which is not of the same nature as a state of things. So, while I say that the sign refers to a state of things, that is to a territoriality, generally what the sign signifies is not a state of things but rather a concept. The sign signifies a concept. We’re not demanding… We’re not looking for anything extraordinary here. So, it signifies a concept. We can in some way say that it no longer refers to a territoriality, but that it leads to a kind of reterritorialization, a reterritorialization that is in this case spiritual or mental. [Pause]\n\nSo there we have it. We’ve opened our passage. What is the sign that refers to another sign, ad infinitum, a sign that refers to a sign that refers to a sign that refers to a sign… to the point that in the end one can no longer even call it a sign, but rather an infinite or unlimited realm of signifiance, an infinite or unlimited realm of signifiance which is precisely the state of a sign that refers to any sign whatsoever? So I can say that the sign that refers to another sign, insofar as it refers to another sign, is a deterritorialized sign [Pause]. No longer referring to a state of things and not yet referring to a signified, it is caught up in the moment of its own deterritorialization.\n\nSuddenly we can say, at the risk of including everything in what we’re discussing, there’s a famous author, Peirce, who proposed a terminology that had a certain success: index, icon, symbol. We don’t really care what he meant by this. That’s not our business. We just imagine that we might be able to make use of these terms. We will say that the index is the sign insofar as it refers to a territoriality whereas the icon is the sign insofar as it leads to a reterritorialization, and the symbol is the sign insofar as it is deterritorialized, that is, the sign that refers to another sign.\n\nBut how can there be a network in which any sign can refer to any other sign? Once again, at this level there are no longer different states of things. Or, as is often said, there are no longer referents. Nor are there signifieds. Quite simply, the sign becomes a signifier when it refers to another sign ad infinitum. This status of the sign is rather bizarre. What is implied by this network of signs become signifiers? It becomes signifiers precisely by the fact that they refer to another sign ad infinitum.\n\nIn what conditions does such a network become possible? There isn’t yet a given signified, rather this network of signs is established on a sort of continuum, a sliding continuum, a slippery continuum. Which means that all possible contents, all signifieds are fused in a kind of atmospheric continuum… [Tape interrupted] [3:24:10]\n\nA kind of amorphous, slippery, revolting continuum… like quicksand. A point, a sign… takes up another sign. Everything occurs as though the continuum had slid. As a result, these signs don’t even require the links of free association. Free association is a complete idiocy. There’s no need. They are drawn towards one another by the slow sliding of the continuum. Once again, there is nothing that associates the dog and the mask. [Reference to the example given toward the beginning of the session] There is just a movement of muddy terrain, of sticky terrain. It’s not surprising. Both paranoid delusion and the despotic formation are traversed by terror. [Pause] And that’s the first characteristic. I have to go faster.\n\nSecond characteristic… The first, as we said, is simply the reference from sign to sign that implies a deterritorialization of the sign and supposes an amorphous, sliding continuum. Second characteristic: the circularity of the system. Indeed one of the most well-known and celebrated representatives of the signifying system, Lacan, says, for example, of the signifying sign that it is “at the risk of a circular return”.  Why “at the risk of a circular return”? You see the signifying chain that is constituted on the amorphous network. — He doesn’t present its constitution in this way, but it’s of no importance –“at the risk of a circular return”, in fact, redundancy already belongs to the system, signifying redundancy, each sign passing into another sign. The dog has become this. It has become. What does it mean that it has become another thing? It means that a slow slippage of the terrain has occurred, causing it to pass into something else. It’s not a happy world. Nor will this be a happy world. [Deleuze indicates the second schéma] To find gay, happy worlds we’ll have to go off on a tangent… “At the risk of circular return”, the sign that passes into another sign, that will pass again on its own account… This impression of eternal return forms part of this sticky atmosphere, the impression of the already lived. A sad impression… [Tape interrupted] [3:27:36]\n\n… When Nietzsche has this impression he leaps with joy, but not for long. He’s dragged under by the quicksand. He trips up in his dance. If nothing else, he was happy for an instant. That’s already something.\n\nTherefore, what we have is a kind of redundancy – not only of the sign with another sign but of the sign with itself. The sign doesn’t enter into relation with another sign in the sliding continuum without entering into relation with itself as that which will always make its return. This is what it is to feel the sign of the despot. The whole of the despot is already there. But we haven’t seen it yet. So that’s the second characteristic. Sorry if I have to rush on, but otherwise we’ll never get finished.\n\nThird dimension. If I keep to my schema and let it guide me… I can say that I’ve roughly accounted for the circularity of the system. But why are there several circles? Why all these spires of the spiral? Why these distinct circles? This is very important for us. Why? Because from one circle to another – and you see how the signs are distributed on these distinct circles… Once more I go back to the example we encountered in the last lesson. With the atmosphere there was that day in this room, the signs weren’t at all on the same circle. We could always say that I was the one who brought it in with me, but I wouldn’t be happy with that, since it implies an operation of redoubling that would put us in mind of certain notions…\n\nA student: But wasn’t it more like the second figure?\n\nDeleuze: You think so?\n\nThe student: Yes. [Pause, laughter; Deleuze pauses to consider this]\n\nDeleuze: The various signs didn’t arise on the same spires or the same circles… The dog, I repeat, was part of the outermost circle. To be specific, insofar as it was a sign pertaining to this formation, it was a deterritorialized dog. It didn’t have its territoriality here. It was a deterritorialized dog. Friendly enough but deterritorialized all the same… [Tape interrupted] [3:30:42]\n\n… In this system of signifiance [Deleuze indicates the first schema], one never ceases… you see how I’m still developing my first point, even if we’re at the third. I’m still developing the first point. Because the sign refers to any other sign, one never ceases to jump from one circle to another. An example is the girl [He refers to the woman who caused the preceding lengthy discussion] She obviously had an account to settle with me. There… a whole private scene was in play, although I had never done anything to her. And she for her part had a public intervention to make. She was making a jump. I think that’s why Félix said – for which someone accused him of being a psychiatrist – that’s why Felix said: She feels anguished. She too… She makes us feel anguished, but she feels it too. She was jumping from one circle to another.\n\nIt’s strange… Because in the system – we still haven’t spoken about the despot, but you can feel he’s always there in the background. In what form? There are his two eyes – in the system you have regulated jumps, ones that are tolerated and others that are forbidden. Regulated jumps are when one can pass, I suppose, from a certain private event to a certain social situation. In other cases, this kind of jump is not permitted. Think for example of the time when military men who were officers didn’t have the right to divorce. What does that mean? If I take a circle which I nominate completely at random, considering I have no particular reason for it to be here or there. It varies… it can be extremely variable. Everything depends on the point of reference. If you take the family home as the center of signifiance, the private circle will be the closest to the hearth. If you take the State apparatus as your center the private circle will be very extrinsic. So we have to put everything into play. To respond to your question, it explodes in every direction.\n\nSo, anyway, I named it very randomly. Let’s imagine that this is the circle of private signs, and this is the circle of public signs. Private event: divorce. The jump is forbidden. The officer is stripped of his rank. It’s a jump you can’t make. You cannot be both an officer and divorced. Of course, things have changed since then… But in what way have they changed? Which jumps are still not tolerated? Which ones?\n\nWhat is it that the Greeks call hybris? [Deleuze writes it on the board] You recall that in Greek tragedy, you have two elements: firstly, there’s the theme of the gods who give a lot to each, who assign lots, as in a lottery; and then you have the man of hybris, who is someone who jumps too far and who overleaps his lot. He has literally jumped too far when prey to a demon. In general, the Greek hero is possessed by hybris, a word usually translated as “outrageousness”. Having failed to measure his jump, he attempts a forbidden jump.\n\nThen there are jumps that are well regulated, for example, when a boy from good family goes to study at the Polytéchnique… this is allowed… There’s a whole system of regulations. One particular example is found in very ancient despotic formations in South America, where passages between private and public signs are strictly regulated, for example between the event of a woman who betrays her husband and the right the husband has to withdraw to the outskirts of the village to pray for a calamity to descend upon the whole village, until such time as purification rites have been performed. Here we have a typical regulation of the jump: a woman betrays her husband and the husband rebounds on a given circle of signifiance to which he has the right. On another circle, he moves to the outskirts of the village and prays to the gods to wipe out all the villagers. So you sense all this… It’s again the sliding continuum that permits him to do so.\n\nBut at the same time, there are forbidden jumps, the ones we’re not supposed to make. This is why I say our schema works by means of a multiplicity of circles. But there’s no need to say where this multiplicity of circles derives from. It’s simple… We have the answer in our last two points. The multiplicity of my circles derives from the following: the sign that refers to another sign, whether on the same circle or on another, is the deterritorialized state of the sign. And I will try to explain to you why this is. It’s the sign in its deterritorialization. Otherwise, it refers to something other than a sign.\n\nHowever, deterritorialization is never a state. It’s a movement. Now, in function of their origin, in function of the territoriality from which they derive… signs do not have the same speed, nor the same nature of deterritorialization. As a result, it’s inevitable that there isn’t a single circle but rather spires of a spiral. These spires or different circles are distinguished according to their speed and to the nature of deterritorialization of the signs that are assigned to each circle or spire. It seems complicated, but actually it’s quite simple. One has to just let oneself go.\n\nGood. Here we already have three coordinates. First coordinate: the sign referring to another sign ad infinitum. This is the sign’s signifiance and state of deterritorialization. Second coordinate: the system is circular, and necessarily so. Third coordinate: it involves a plurality of distinct circles or spires of a spiral, with both regulated jumps from one circle to the other and also forbidden jumps between circles. In a certain sense, Oedipus, the despot… it sometimes happens that the despot himself makes the forbidden jump. And in Oedipus, there’s a famous line, when Oedipus asks in relation to his own case: “Which demon has leapt the longest leap?” That is to say, which demon led me to make the forbidden jump? A jump in the sense of… [Deleuze makes a jumping gesture with his hands, but does not finish the sentence]\n\nFourth coordinate: it’s not enough that we have several circles. Each time we add a dimension. In the second coordinate, we obtained the idea of the circle, and in the third, the plurality of circles. But we don’t yet have a sufficient number of dimensions. Fourth coordinate or dimension: we need something that assures the expansion of the circles, that assures their perpetual expansion. What prevents the signifying regime from dying of a sort of entropy, as physicists would say? What prevents the entropy of the system from growing to the point that everything is annulled in the indeterminate and anonymous continuum? This continuum is very dangerous because it is at the same time the quicksand that carries the sign to another sign and also what rises up and risks drowning everything in an atmospheric continuity where one can no longer distinguish anything. At which point the whole system would suffocate.\n\nTherefore, something is required to continually recharge the circles. To recharge the signs on every circle. Something is required to be able to assure the circles’ expansion. What assures it, therefore, is the fact that all at once, in another dimension that I can’t even represent, every sign, or group of signs — it hardly matters — will be made to correspond to a signified. We are no longer in the domain of signifiance, we are in the domain of what we could call interpretation. To interpret means to make a sign or a group of signs, presumed to be signifiers, refer to a signified.\n\nIt’s not the same situation we had in the first dimension where the only signified was the amorphous anonymous, atmospheric continuum itself. Now, on the contrary, the continuum is cut, in such a way as to make every group of signs correspond to a signified. Here we no longer have the figure of the despot but that of his accomplice, the interpreter, the diviner. The diviner will interpret the signs which is to say he will make them correspond to a given signified.\n\nFine, but how does that suffice to recharge the system as a whole? I’m going even faster now! It’s not a modern discovery to say that no interpretation ever arrives at an ultimate interpreted. What the diviners interpret are always other interpretations. The diviner emits signs… but what do they interpret? The signs of the goddess ad infinitum. In other words, if someone asked us what is the ultimate signified, we would have to respond: the signifier. And I’m not the one making this up. All the champions of the signifier agree on this point. Which is the best interpretation? They also say it or perform it: it’s silence.\n\nThis is what psychoanalysts have discovered: no longer to interpret but to keep silent. And it’s this silence of the analyst that gives the patient something to interpret. Each time the interpretation, since it can do no more than replace another interpretation, recharges the signifier and refuels the sign with signifiance… And so here we have a first way to defeat the entropy of the system. It’s the diviner, which is to say the man with the delusion of interpretation, who has the task of recharging the entropy of the system with signifiance.\n\nAs a result, at the extreme, parenthetically, what we have is a way to distinguish paranoia and interpretation. Though they are in the same group, they are not the same thing. This means that since the signified continuously refers to the signifier, and is in the last instance, the signifier itself, the interpretation that assigns the signified to a group of signs always recharges signifiance. Thus the machine of signifiance will constantly be recharged from within.\n\nSo we can say that the two maladies, because that’s what they are, the two maladies of humanity are finally signifiance and interpretation.

Purdue University Research Repository. doi:10.4231/VZAD-BN24\n\n\n\n\nGilles Deleuze\n\nDeleuze & Guattari at Vincennes, 1975-76\n\nIl Senso in Meno, Part 9 – Faciality as the substance of the Signifier, the Two Scapegoats and the Line of Flight\n\nTranslated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; revised translation, Charles J. Stivale\n\n[Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions]\n\n[3:45:50, start; 4:21:40, end; segment total, 36:50; session total, 1:59:19, from YouTube recording, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Po2tIgeD4]\n\n… The signifier with a capital “S” is pure redundancy. It’s no longer the redundancy of a sign with respect to another sign, nor of the sign in relation to itself, it is redundancy in its pure state. The Signifier in its pure state is fort da. The bobbin game. That one chews on… Why does one chew on it? Because the Signifier in its pure state is so pure that we no longer even know what it is, whether it’s in its place when it’s not, or not in its place when it is. Very good… perfect.\n\nNow that we know something about it, we can go faster. We saw this on other occasions, that the Signifier wouldn’t be anything if it didn’t have a substance to stabilize it. And this substance is faciality. This substance is the black hole of the eyes on the white wall. And if the Signifier can establish itself and establish its dichotomies and establish its signs and organize them in binary relationships where the sign refers to another sign, it is only in function of the organization made possible by faciality. And faciality is precisely the mainstay of the Signifier, otherwise there wouldn’t be one.\n\nWhich is why the champions of the Signifier hide their faces. No, they don’t hide their faces exactly, but they appear to say that the Signifier has no real need of their face. But at night they laugh… They’re impostors. Who laugh while looking at themselves in the mirror, perfectly aware that by virtue…\n\n[Interruption by a student]\n\nA woman student: [Inaudible comment]\n\nDeleuze (laughing): Yes, that arrives quite well… [since they know well] that without the face the Signifier would simply merge with the amorphous continuum.\n\nTherefore, the black hole – white wall system is constitutive of the Signifier and of its operations on signs, which are the establishing of binarisms, binary relationships, dichotomies. And what I call dichotomy is this very movement. I’m just making the gesture [points to the blackboard] to go faster… What I call binary relationship is this movement, the relation of sign to sign, with the dichotomy being rooted in the Signifier. Here we have the binary distribution of signs.\n\nWe’re going really quickly now. So, at this level, once again, there’s no secret. In the despotic formation or the paranoid regime, you will never find secrets, only publicity. The despot says: “Here is my face, I won’t hide my face.” And I’ve already quoted to you from a text that I find very interesting in this regard. I don’t have time to quote it again in its entirety… it’s on pages 20-25 of a book by Luc de Heusch, The Drunken King, Or the Origin of the State [Le roi ivre ou l’origine de l’État (Paris: Gallimard, 1972); on this specific example, see A Thousand Plateaus, p. 353]\n\nAccording to Bantu myth, the myths of the Bantu people… the despotic Bantu emperor eats in public, he doesn’t hide his face. But then a disturbing man arrives: the man of the State. The man of the State has no army. I say this to remind those of you who were here two years ago, of things that we touched upon then but didn’t develop… In any case, they’re still a bit hazy. He doesn’t have an army, but he has a police force, a bureaucracy, but no army. He undertakes major public works. He shows his face everywhere, his eyes like black holes. To each of his subjects he says: “I am here.”\n\nAnd now another figure arrives from who knows where: a little guy who has come from the exterior, the man of War. Who will conquer everything and destroy it all. The man of War isn’t a paranoiac, nor is he a despot. He’s from another race, no better but different. He’s something else. He arrives. And in the Bantu myth he doesn’t eat in public. He wears a veil, he eats in a tent. We’re not supposed to see him. He’s the secret. The regime of the secret was invented by the Mongols. Or by this Bantu who was not really a Bantu but… It was invented by the Mongols, meaning the nomads, the guys of the war machine. For them, speaking of State secrets is a nonsense. There is no such thing. The State doesn’t need secrets. It’s the military machine that needs and invents secrets. It’s the warrior chief who eats veiled and who invents them. In this there’s no publicity. And meanwhile the despot continually repeats: “Look into my eyes!”\n\nSo, well then, we must add that if the Signifier requires the wall and the black hole of the face, it is for all the reasons we have looked at concerning the face. We don’t need to go back to that. Sometimes we just have to accept the things we’ve acquired, you see? After all, it’s that all this thing is linked up. We just notice suddenly, as we’re thinking that we’re heading in one direction, we then stumble upon something else and say, hey, that’s fine, we’ve seen this. So, it’s perfect.\n\nWhy? What roles does the face play with respect to the signifier? Returning to the distinctions I proposed between index, icon and symbol, the Signifier, which is the most deterritorialized of signs — since it makes sure that all other signs refer to all other signs — requires any form whatever of reterritorialization. The face is the form of reterritorialization proper to the Signifier. This is why we have to undo the face. The face is the icon of the Signifier. So, there we have the fifth dimension.\n\nA sixth one [Pause], a sixth dimension: there aren’t many left. So now the sixth dimension. A new adventure begins in which I’ll need another dimension. So, we already have a six-dimensional multiplicity. What is this exactly?\n\nImagine the following; let’s dream a bit. Through his interpretations, the diviner-priest continually recharges the system of signifiance. He prevents the growth of entropy. But it’s not enough. The system is nonetheless menaced. Several other related operations are required. It functions but only up to a certain point. It needs something else. The entropy that menaces the system is also a line by means of which the irradiating circular system would escape, escape into the quicksands of the amorphous continuum, tracing death in a shallow stream. The system’s line of flight has to be blocked. And this is something that no diviner with his interpretations can do. The line of flight has to be barred. Which is why it can only exist as a broken, dotted line. So, what can be done?\n\nIn Foucault’s Discipline and Punish, there’s a marvellous page where he says that the body of the condemned man is like the inverted, symmetrical image of the body of the king. The torture victim’s body is the symmetrically inverted image of the king’s body. We can also say that it is the symmetrically inverted image of the despot’s body. Indeed, the condemned or tortured man has above all else lost his face. He hasn’t lost the id. He has become the man without a face. What does that mean?\n\nTo be a torture victim is not the last word. Although in a certain sense it is, since he’s going to die… But here the logical chain is very strange. Torture is never the end. In the logical chain, the historico-logical chain, torture is always followed by something else. It comes before expulsion. And Oedipus, to cite him again, begins by blinding himself, meaning that he loses face. And he runs away. He runs away, or rather he is sent away. He is cast out by Creon on the system’s line of flight: “Go, get out!”\n\nThere exist two goats. In the ritual of the goat, there are always two goats that assure the logical chain, otherwise it couldn’t be assured. First of all, there is the goat we call scapegoat, which will be killed. But following this, and only following this, is another, much more significant, goat called the emissary goat which is chased away along the line of flight. You understand why the system needs two goats… because they must first kill and then chase away. And this is the true logic. To be able to proceed, two goats are required.\n\nNow what is this emissary goat? It is the anti-face… The goat’s anus is the inverted image of the despot’s gaze. The goat is made to flee along the line of flight. And what does the goat carry with it? It carries everything that has compromised – during periods of ritual, for example – the signifiance of the system, that is, the load of forbidden jumps, and everything that has threatened the signifiance of signs. And everything that has threatened the face… the face of the Signifier. It takes upon itself all these evils. And the goat is cast out into the desert.\n\nSo, the last dimension of the system is the presence of a line of flight but one that is afflicted with a negative value. On which the emissary goat will be forced to flee – or we could call it the exile, or the damned, which is an essential cog in the system of signifiance. It’s as though everything that threatens signifiance has to be cast out.\n\nLast dimension: in other words, what does it represent, this broken line of flight along which the goat is cast out? We just need to connect up all our dimensions. It represents the following: the line that, through its tenor, exceeds the level of deterritorialization permitted by the system of signifiance, however high or advanced may be this deterritorialization, however far the system of signifiance enters into the deterritorialization. In reality it doesn’t go very far. It reterritorializes on the face, it reterritorializes on overcodings, it reterritorializes in every way imaginable.\n\nTherefore, what surpasses its own level of deterritorialization will be as if barred, marked by a negative value, a negative sign. And this is it: the minus sign that marks the ritual of the emissary goat. Or else, this is the ritual of exile.\n\nSo, I’m almost done. Perhaps you would you be so kind as to share your thoughts with me on all this. I would say that now at least, [Deleuze indicates the first schema] we won’t have any problem linking — this will occur almost in a concrete way — linking our second figure, the successive linear figure of proceedings, to the first one will happen almost as a matter of course. It won’t be difficult because… let’s imagine the following story – I’m go back to some themes I quickly threw at you last time — imagine the following story:\n\nOne day a people are forced to leave or abandon their temple, or even to see their temple destroyed. In the case where they have to leave the temple, they carry with them a small ark that is at continual risk of falling… a small fragile ark. Naturally they dream of rebuilding a temple. However, this temple is again and again destroyed at regular intervals. To simplify we can say that they lost their temple.\n\nThe whole system of signifiance trembles. Also, for other reasons, but we’re telling a story here, the whole system of signifiance risks crumbling to dust. The master Signifier, the eyes, the face, nothing works any more. Aside from which, this people or this person – we don’t yet need to know which of these it concerns – will precipitate onto the line of flight with the ark. Except that… and what is the stroke of genius, the radically new thing here? What will be his momentous words? “Let misfortune befall us.” But since we no longer have a temple, we no longer have a scapegoat. Unless we become our own scapegoat. Unless we become our own sacrificial lamb. The goat and the lamb are the same thing.\n\nIn John of Patmos’s Apocalypse – yes, John of Patmos… he can’t possibly be the other John… In the Apocalypse there is the lion, the lion that roars, but we never see this roaring lion. What appears is a lamb. In the system of signifiance, the immolated God will take the place of the immolating God. The lamb… even if the lion continues roaring over him, and God knows it’s a lion-lamb, but the lion takes the skin of the lamb. We shall be our own lamb, our own goat. We no longer have a temple; we cannot cast out what was menacing the system because we no longer have a system. Therefore, we shall be the ones who take the line of flight. We shall be the goat and the lamb. “Let misfortune befall us.”\n\nSo, they leave for the desert, the narrow passage. The extraordinary thing here is that the line of flight has now taken on a positive sign. And an astounding abyss opens up between the two systems. The line of flight has become positivity, while in all other despotic formations it was marked by negation, by a negative value. It was the place where what menaced the system was made to take flight. Now a whole group, a whole people sets off on foot in the narrow passage of the desert, having lost their temple, having become their own scapegoat and lamb. And they flee along the line of flight, which for that very reason becomes positive.\n\nFrom a certain perspective, it’s a new step, a new level… a new threshold of deterritorialization has been passed. The deterritorialization of the passional system will be infinitely greater and stronger than the deterritorialization of signifiance. So you understand that, beginning from this first dimension of the system, other dimensions multiply.\n\nI’m just saying – because we’ve had enough of this; I would like to discuss this a little with you — I will just add that the function of faciality, of the face, cannot be the same here. But I’ve forgotten to mention something that will complete our framework. Here I don’t even need to… anyway, in what way is this as much the system of deception as one of paranoid delusion, a delusion of interpretation? It’s both a social formation and a despotic formation. According to – this is almost a practical exercise – according to the characteristic I proposed to you – and you might want to add others, combine them, subtract, underline some – and what you will obtain is a delusion in hospital, a social formation, a system, what kind? A system of groups, of individuals, a system for which we’ve had proposed the name “system of deception.” Why?\n\nBecause everything it contains is deception. Everything is deception, trickery, at every level. In the centre, you have the face of the despot. The despot’s face, this type of mask that priests manipulate when necessary, making it speak. The impotent despot and so on… Therefore, you have deception at the centre of signifiance, and deception in interpretation.\n\nIt’s well known that the diviner is essentially a trickster. Deception at the level of the jumps. Deception at the level of forbidden jumps, whereby whoever makes a forbidden jump deceives. But deception reigns also at the level of jumps that are completely regulated. My wife has betrayed me so I will pray for a calamity to strike the whole village.\n\nAnd in a certain sense, this is the way the State apparatus functions. And with it the man of the State, through this widespread deception in which also humble subjects deceive, the despot deceives, everyone deceives. It doesn’t mean anything, it’s not against the law. Deception really is an integral part of the functioning, one of the cogs of the system. The same goes for the courtier who stays close to the despot, or for the man of the State — the despot’s functionary — as for ordinary subjects, and so on, everyone is engaged in deception.\n\nSo here, not only should we expect there to be a manner of functioning completely different from that of the face and faciality, but also one that is completely different from that of deception. So, from this point everything will change. But it’s quite random. I began from this dimension [Deleuze indicates the first schema], but I may as well have begun from another. A new sign is attributed to the line of flight or the line of deterritorialization. Rather than having a negative sign, which is already occupied by the goat, it takes up a positive sign insofar as a whole group… So here we have the abandoned temple, from which the people carry away a packet of signs, a little packet of signs that they will carry with them as they head off into the desert. And there will be a succession of proceedings. One, two, three, four and so on. All of which will be punctuated by pauses. A small packet of homogeneous signs flees along a segmented line. Or it’s the figure that’s completely different from the previous one.\n\nSo, we need to expect, and we will see this after, in what sense the face changes both its figure and function — which suits us perfectly since we discovered there were two types of face with respect to the question of faciality — in what sense is this no longer a regime of deception but a different type of regime? What happens in this system?\n\nLet’s not forget that we, “modern” people, how can I say, we people of Christian… Greco-Christian background, and I’ve no idea why we’re called that, or more simply we could say those of us who belong to a capitalist system or a certain social formation, we always live in mixed semiotics.\n\nConcrete semiotics are always mixed. A piece of this system bumps into a piece of this other system… It’s always like that and the contrary, and everything all mixed up. In the mechanisms of banking, to take a random example, we have the system of rotation and circular expansion and at the same time bits of proceedings. And concrete social machines function by means of this mixity not only between the two systems – since we looked only at two examples of semiotics… But to go on answering your question, there can be infinite numbers of semiotics: 8, 10, 12… we will see…\n\nI can only say that in what we did before, for example, the semiotic that for convenience’s sake we called “primitive”, the corporeal semiotic of “primitive” peoples, doesn’t refer either to this system [the first schema] or that [the second schema]. It’s a very specific type of semiotic, and even when we say “primitive” semiotic, that encompasses semiotics that are completely different from each other. And the nomadic semiotic I just mentioned doesn’t equate either with this one [the second schema] or that one [the first schema]. So, you can never have enough semiotics.\n\nWe “moderns” live — and here, I could cite one of Nietzsche’s most wonderful phrases, if only I could remember it [Laughter]… I can’t, but it was great anyway [Laughter]… “a variegated painting of all that has been thought” [In fact, “ye who are pictures of all that hath ever been believed”, from Thus Spoke Zarathustra, “The Land of Culture”; see also Nietzsche and Philosophy, V.11, “The Sense of Affirmation”]  And by that, he didn’t mean to define us merely as people but as a social formation. “A variegated painting of all that has been thought” — And this is what we live from. All the old semiotics are fine for us. I think that money, the semiotics of money, has made a syncretism of all the semiotics there have ever been, whether primitive, signifying, passional, nomadic, whatever… So, what do you think? Does that suffice? Have you had enough? [Laughter, scattered applause, Deleuze chuckles] … [Tape interrupted] [4:15:15]\n\n[Although this could suffice for the session, the film recording continues with six minutes of discussion with one of Deleuze’s frequent interlocutors, his student Georges Comtesse]\n\nGeorges Comtesse: … Not at all… the system of this face-substance centre, the face as signifying substance, not only what is at the heart of things – I don’t mean heart in the sense of provenance [The camera, moving right, shows Claire Parnet standing and smoking] but on a given surface, given line of divergence of sense, which is the paranoiac line. I think there is a becoming. In encounters, there is always a very intensive becoming that seems to me the becoming which provokes an excess of signs, almost as the defect of the sign, of this excess of concentric circles… and that has a profound relationship with the becoming-paranoiac. Becoming intense, isn’t that… so what is it?\n\nIn the case of president Schreber, it’s simply a becoming-woman. How great it would be to be a woman who submits to coupling. Paranoid femininity… But already, in all paranoias – and this is the rule of paranoia – right from the beginning no paranoiac can bear a becoming intense or this kind of femininity. Every paranoiac, if he’s not a philosopher, if he doesn’t recompose a line of reconvergence of sense… every paranoiac, as soon as they experience it, even just for an instant, a fleeting instant… every paranoiac want to arrest this becoming at all costs, “police” the becoming, stop it at all costs and start again for example, from a sign, the sign of sex as it happens, because sex is also a sign – and perhaps it’s the sign of becoming intense that makes the jump. At which point there will be a deterritorialization, which won’t just be that of the concentric circles or the signs on them that you spoke about. What will be produced in this arrest of becoming as a centre of signifiance, a surface not at all like the one you described… it’s not a white surface with black holes, because this seems to me a secondary effect, even if it’s true that it is there…\n\nDeleuze: Ah… that’s rich…\n\nComtesse: And there is…\n\nDeleuze: That’s rich that you call it a secondary effect!\n\nComtesse: And there is continually a surface of the arrest of becoming, or of the excess of signs, that I would call… the virginal surface of voluptuousness with a black abyss which does not…\n\nDeleuze: Oh well, shit! Give me a break! [General laughter]\n\nComtesse: … which does not at all equate….\n\nDeleuze (standing up): You’ll excuse me, I’ll let you finish afterwards, but now you’re really having a laugh. You tell us: “Your white wall-black hole system doesn’t work”. You tell me, what works for you is a virginal surface with a…\n\nComtesse: A black abyss…\n\nDeleuze: With a black abyss. [Deleuze chortles with everyone] Fine, fine. Given this, I understand what you are saying – no, no, I’ll let you continue in a second – in saying, which you add, there’s a becoming in paranoid delusion,\n\nComtesse: Yes!\n\nDeleuze: … except that, here’s the point, it’s entirely blocked off…\n\nComtesse: Exactly!\n\nDeleuze: This isn’t… So, here you’re providing a confirmation…\n\nComtesse: Certainly!\n\nDeleuze: And I add to confirm what you are saying that, as you know better than I do, President Schreber’s rapport with God occurs through rays, and these rays interest us in terms of the white wall-black hole system, because through binarity, arborescence and binary relationships, they divide the world into a higher and lower sphere. And in its turn, the lower world is divided in two and so on. Everything you said – and this is not a retort to your observation – makes me happy because it absolutely confirms everything we said – it’s a benediction for us!\n\nComtesse: Perhaps there isn’t just the landscape-face system but also a mirage-shore type of pictorial splitting…\n\nDeleuze: You’re saying mirage… now I understand!\n\nComtesse: I want to continue! I’m saying virginal surface of voluptuousness… You speak about God, for example.\n\nDeleuze: Yes, yes?\n\nComtesse: Eventually, President Schreber perceives his own voluptuousness as though it were that of God in his virginal surface, which is a surface of the scream…\n\nDeleuze: Now you’re bringing us back to castration!\n\nComtesse: … a scream. [Pause, laughter] I’m not at all bringing it back to that; I’m not at all bring it back to that. I’m saying that you go too fast when you talk about the signifier. I’m just talking about becoming, arrest of becoming, virginal surface of voluptuousness with a black abyss of desire…\n\nDeleuze:  I think we can work this out.\n\nComtesse: It’s clear that the virginal surface and the white surface…\n\nDeleuze: I wouldn’t call it virginal…\n\nComtesse: They could be linked…\n\nDeleuze: Okay if you prefer virginal to white, we can agree on that.\n\nComtesse: Absolutely! Perhaps the line of flight you inserted there flies off on the passional delusion… Let’s take Pierre Rivière. [Note that Michel Foucault’s book on Pierre Rivière appeared in 1973] With Pierre Rivière, in the beginning there seems to be a binarism. For example, he opposes himself to the father, mortified, humiliated disgusted, and against matriarchal power, which is mortifying, almost vampiric, all that, the infinite indebtedness of the father, its power which provokes his suicide, and so on. It seems there is a binarity there. But in fact, in fact, he is experimenting. Through this pseudo-binarity, he is experimenting with a becoming-woman of the father… [End of the recording] [4:21:39]\n\n"
