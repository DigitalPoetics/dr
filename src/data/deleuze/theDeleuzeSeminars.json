        "text": "Gilles Deleuze\n\nLecture of 30 November 1969\n\nTheory of Multiplicities in Bergson\n\nTranslated by Timothy S. Murphy\n\n… I wanted to propose to you an investigation [that would be] a little bit particular, very localized historically. The word is “multiplicity.” There is a very current use of multiplicity: for example, I say: a multiplicity of numbers, a multiplicity of acts, a multiplicity of states of consciousness, a multiplicity of shocks [ébranlements]. Here “multiplicity” is employed as a barely nominalized adjective. And it's true that Bergson often expressed himself thus.\n\nBut at other times, the word “multiplicity” is employed in the strong sense, as a true substantive. Thus, from the second chapter of Time and Free Will onward, the number is a multiplicity, which does not mean the same thing at all as a multiplicity of numbers.\n\nWhy do we feel that this use of multiplicity, as a substantive, is at once unusual and important? It’s because, so long as we employ the adjective multiple, we only think a predicate that we necessarily place in a relation of opposition and complementarity with the predicate ONE: the one and the multiple, the thing is one or multiple, and it’s even one and multiple.\n\nOn the contrary, when we employ the substantive multiplicity, we already indicate thereby that we have surpassed [dépassé] the opposition of predicates one/multiple, that we are already set up on a completely different terrain, and on this terrain we are necessarily led to distinguish types of multiplicity.\n\nIn other words, the very notion of multiplicity taken as a substantive implies a displacement of all of thought: for the dialectical opposition of the one and the multiple, we substitute the typological difference between multiplicities…"
