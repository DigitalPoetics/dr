<BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle} description={desription}>
	<p>
	   Digital and computational tools we use for analytics of cultural and aesthetic content are typically not developed to model its matter and form.
		When borrowing from technical and scientific domains,
	   how might we adapt these tools to model cultural and artistic practices?
	</p>
	<p>
	   More specifically, as researchers across the humanities and arts are increasingly turning to these tools, 
	   how might we repurpose them for humanistic research?
	</p>
	<h3>Why Diagrams?</h3>
	<p>
		Digital humanists and data science scholars have proposed methods such as 
		pursuing novel algorithms to model cultural objects,<Superscript id="1" />
		building mixed-methods research frameworks,<Superscript id="2" />
		or advancing critically informed analytical practices.<Superscript id="3" />
	</p>
	<p>
		We take cue from Johanna Drucker, who suggests that these interventions should be made at the diagrammatic plance.

    text="An act of creating an inflection, adding an attribute, or making a change in a graph would feed back into the structured data. This would create data and could also intervene in the formal structures of the data, even changing its structure."

		In fig. 1, Drucker gives a sketch of "creating an inflection" on the network graph.
		According to the top right figure, more than one centrality measurements could be rendered on each node, e.g.,
		shading for degree centrality, brightness for eigenvector centrality, and glow for betweenness centrality.

	<p>
		Here, Drucker is proposing a comparative approach to analytics, namely,
		how does the node behave in a network when rendered with different centrality measurements?
		Although this particular example is not practically feasible--
		the nodes will be visually cluttered if all three measurements are rendered at once, 
		and, in our experience, it's better to depict the centrality measurements on different graphs--
		it illustrates the virtuality of graphical expressions.
