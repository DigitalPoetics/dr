<BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle} description={desription}>
	<p>
	   Digital and computational tools we use for analytics of cultural and aesthetic forms were usually not developed to model these materials.
	   They have to be adapted from technical and scientific domains.
	   How might we repurpose these tools to model these forms and formations?
	</p>
	<p>
	   More importantly, as researchers across the humanities and arts are increasingly turning to these tools, 
	   how might we repurpose them for humanistic research?
	</p>
	<p>
		Digital humanists and data science scholars have proposed methods such as 
		pursuing novel algorithms to model cultural objects,<Superscript id="1" />
		building mixed-methods research frameworks,<Superscript id="2" />
		or advancing critically informed analytical practices.<Superscript id="3" />
	</p>
	<p>
		We take cue from Johanna Drucker, who suggests that these interventions should be made at the diagrammatic plance.

		In fig. 1, Drucker gives a sketch of "creating an inflection" on the network graph.
		According to the top right figure, more than one centrality measurements could be rendered on each node, e.g.,
		shading for degree centrality, brightness for eigenvector centrality, and glow for betweenness centrality.
